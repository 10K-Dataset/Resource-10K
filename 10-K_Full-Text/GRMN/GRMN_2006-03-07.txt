Company
      Overview

Garmin
      is
      a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
      devices, most of which are enabled by GPS technology. Garmin designs, develops,
      manufactures and markets a diverse family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount
      GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications and information
      products for the consumer and general aviation markets.

Overview
      of the Global Positioning System

The
      Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the
      precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
      technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
      The
      satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained
      and
      operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing
      satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.
      Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.


Reception
      of GPS signals from the satellites requires line-of-sight visibility between
      the
      satellites and the receiver. GPS receivers can be very compact, and it is not
      necessary to have a large dish antenna to receive GPS signals.

Prior
      to
      May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy
      of
      civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (‘‘SA’’) for
      national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a
      radius of 100 meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense
      discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004,
      the
      Bush administration stated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA again
      and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial of
      service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS
      receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters
      or
      less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The
      accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques
      which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
      to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a
      Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’) comprising ground reference stations
      and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available
      in the United States and portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3
      meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
      and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased
      accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers
      for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS
      system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was
      available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics
      equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference
      stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Recent
      Developments in the Company’s Business

Since
      the
      inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 14 million products, which
      includes the delivery of over 3 million products during 2005.

New
      Consumer Product Introductions

In
      Garmin launched 40 new consumer products. Among these was the

nüvi

™

.
      The
      nüvi combines a full-featured GPS navigator, language translator, MP3 player,
      audio book player, currency and measurement converter, world clock, and digital
      photo organizer in one device.

Garmin
      introduced several new versions of its popular StreetPilot

®

line of
      portable automotive navigators in 2005. The c-Series

™

(c310,
      c320, c330, and c340) features Garmin’s easy-to-use touch-screen interface
      combined with turn-by-turn voice directions. The c340 adds text-to-speech (voice
      directions that speak street names) and utilizes real-time traffic information
      in select major metro areas throughout the U.S. and Europe through Garmin’s
      separate GTM 10 receiver. We also introduced the i-Series™ (comprised of the
      i2™, i3™, and i5™), which are Garmin’s smallest, most inexpensive line of
      automotive navigators. Garmin also expanded upon its 2600 series of navigators
      by introducing the StreetPilot 2720, which adds text-to-speech and optional
      real-time traffic capability, and the StreetPilot 2730, which further adds
      the
      capabilities of XM traffic, weather, and radio and an MP3 player. Finally,
      in
      December 2005 Garmin began shipping its StreetPilot 7000-Series (7200 and 7500),
      a new family of automotive units, that display navigation, entertainment,
      traffic, and weather information on a large, seven-inch touchscreen.

In
      September 2005, Garmin announced that Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group would
      begin offering a customized version of Garmin’s StreetPilot c330 portable
      automotive navigators for rental at 138 Dollar and Thrifty automobile rental
      locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. This was followed in January 2006
      by
      the announcement that Enterprise Rent-A-Car will begin offering a customized
      version of Garmin’s StreetPilot

®

c340
      automotive navigator to its customers for rental at selected airport rental
      locations in the U.S.


Garmin
      also added several models to its personal digital assistant (PDA) product line
      in 2005, including its iQue

®

M5, a
      Microsoft

®

Windows
      Mobile™-based Pocket PC integrated with Global Positioning System (GPS) and
      Bluetooth

®

wireless
      technology. Garmin also introduced the iQue M3 (incorporating Garmin’s c-Series
      automotive navigation software) and the iQue M4 (Garmin’s first iQue to come
      pre-loaded with street maps of the entire U.S., Canada, and Puerto
      Rico).

In
      September 2005, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile™, a server-based navigation
      service available on selected handsets on the Sprint PCS network.

In
      the
      category of GPS-enabled fitness products, Garmin introduced the Forerunner™ 301
      in January 2005, which includes a heart-rate monitor and a highly integrated
      personal training system. Garmin also introduced the Edge™ - a new line of
      integrated personal training systems designed for cyclists. New models with
      watts of transmit power were also introduced to expand Garmin’s Rino

®

line of
      two-way radio/integrated GPS products. In the marine segment, Garmin introduced
      the GPSMAP

®

376C - a
      portable GPS navigator capable of displaying graphical XM WX Satellite Weather™
data. Garmin also announced a new lineup of fishfinders, sonar devices,
      chartplotters, and chartplotter/sonar combination units in November 2005, all
      of
      which are expected to be available in stores in March 2006.

Garmin
      began selling several products designed for leading automotive and motorcycle
      OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in 2005. These included the Navus™, a
      GPS navigator offered as a dealer-installed option specifically designed for
      many models of Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles, and the Trail Guide™, a GPS

®

Wrangler

®

.
      Garmin
      also began selling a Garmin-designed GPS navigation system to Harley-Davidson
      for certain Harley-Davidson models called the Roadtech™ Quest

®

.
      In
      addition, in September 2005 Garmin announced that it had been awarded tier-one
      OEM supplier status by Honda Motorcycle for its modular GPS navigation system
      developed for the 2006 Honda Gold Wing motorcycle.

New
      Aviation Product Introductions

Garmin
      began selling its G1000 integrated avionics system along with its integrated
      GFC
      700 autopilot to Raytheon Aircraft Company for its Beechcraft Bonanza G36
      aircraft in 2005. In addition, Garmin announced that Embraer, Diamond Aircraft
      Company, and Columbia Aircraft had selected Garmin’s G1000 integrated avionics
      system for various aircraft models. As of February 1, 2006, the G1000 system
      has
      been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for installation in 13
      aircraft models.

In
      July
      2005, Garmin introduced the GPSMAP

              program is currently under development with implementation of the
              ground-based portion of the ADS-B network taking place along the East
              Coast and in Arizona. Additional installations of the ADS-B ground
              stations are planned. The ground stations can track aircraft movement
              and
              will eventually be used to broadcast traffic and weather services.
              Pilots
              equipped with the GDL 90 and operating within the ground station coverage
              area will receive aircraft traffic and real-time weather information
              free
              of charge.

GDL 69 and 69A

The GDL 69 offers the ability to provide
              real-time weather information to the aircraft which can be displayed
              on
              one of several panel-mounted devices, such as the GNS 430, GNS 530,
              MX20,
              and G1000 systems. The GDL 69 and GDL 69A receive real-time weather
              information broadcast by the XM WX Satellite radio system. In addition,

Manufacturing
        and Operations

Garmin
        believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability
        at
        its Shijr, Taiwan facility, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon
        facility. Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided
        it the following benefits:

Reduced
        time-to-market.

Utilizing
        concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s products are introduced to
        production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by
        manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
        In
        this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product
        from
        its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and
        yields. Reducing time to market has enabled Garmin to offer several industry
        firsts, such as the Rino GPS-enabled Family Radio Service/General Mobile
        Radio
        Service two-way radio, the iQue 3600 portable digital assistant with integrated
        GPS and mapping, and the GNS 430, which integrates traditional aviation
        navigation and communications systems with GPS in a single package.

Design
        and process optimization.

Garmin
        uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products
        and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower cost and better
        value
        for customers. Garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and
        manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to
        minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof,
        and
        rugged.

Logistical
        agility.

Operating
        its own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as
        component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the
        electronics industry. Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component
        shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can quickly fill the distribution
        pipeline. Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by maintaining
        a
        safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from
        one
        product line to another.

Garmin’s
        design and manufacturing processes are certified to ISO 9001-2000, international
        quality standards developed by the International Organization for
        Standardization. Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facility has also achieved TS
        16949:2002 quality certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
        In addition, Garmin’s aviation panel-mount products are designed and
        manufactured according to processes which are approved and monitored by the
        FAA.

Materials

Garmin
        purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the
        world. For certain components, Garmin relies on sole source suppliers. The
        failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and
        in a
        timely manner could adversely affect our business.


Seasonality

Our
        sales
        are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer
        products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during
        the
        spring and summer marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased
        demand during the holiday buying season. Sales of consumer products are also
        influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation products
        do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the
        timing
        of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the
        strongest.

Backlog

Our
        sales
        are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle
        between
        order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
        material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders
        within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual
        Property

Our
        success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary
        technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
        trade
        secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect
        our
        proprietary rights. As of March 1, 2006, we held 254 U.S. patents that expire
        at
        various dates no earlier than 2009. As of March 1, 2006, Garmin had 160 U.S.
        patent applications pending. Garmin also holds 4 foreign patents and has
        foreign patent applications pending. In addition, Garmin often relies on
        licenses of intellectual property for use in its business. For example, Garmin
        obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products
        from
        various sources. Our registered U.S. trademarks include: GARMIN, BLUECHART,
        CITY
        SELECT, DCG, ETREX, ETREX CAMO, ETREX LEGEND, ETREX SUMMIT, ETREX VENTURE,
        ETREX
        VISTA, FORERUNNER, GNC, GPSMAP, IQUE, MAPSOURCE, METROGUIDE, PERSONAL NAVIGATOR,
        QUEST, RINO, SEE-THRU, STREETPILOT, and TRACBACK Our mark GARMIN and certain
        of
        our other trademarks have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
        Garmin’s trademarks include EDGE, FORETREX, GARMIN MOBILE, G1000, GEKO,
        MOTIONBASED, NROUTE, NÜVI, PERSONAL TRAVEL ASSISTANT, QUE and ULTRASCROLL. Some
        of Garmin’s patents and its registered trademarks and trademarks are owned by
        Garmin’s subsidiaries, Garmin Corporation, Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin
        AT, Inc.

We
        believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of
        our
        employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue
        to
        file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect
        Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

There
        is
        no assurance that Garmin’s current patents, or patents which we may later
        acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It
        is
        also possible that any patent issued to Garmin may not provide us with any
        competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude Garmin
        from
        manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite Garmin’s efforts to
        protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
        aspects
        of Garmin’s products or to obtain and use information that Garmin regards as
        proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce Garmin’s
        intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets, to determine
        the
        validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against
        claims of infringement or invalidity.


Regulations

        aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated
        aircraft” are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the
        European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before
        they
        can be used in an aircraft. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated,
        and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
        In
        accordance with Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations,
        wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified
        by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are
        sold.
        Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives
        of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications
        for new
        products or enhancements to Garmin’s products or losing certification for
        Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business.

Because
        Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in
        Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect
        to
        remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations.
        The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder,
        provide
        that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
        to
        handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central
        Bank of China, also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor
        trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency
        earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used
        freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of
        merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign
        exchange banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan
        companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside
        and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million
        respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
        within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to
        be
        reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to remittances
        involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other
        foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess
        of the
        limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate
        business reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also
        imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt
        with the CBC.

Environmental
        Matters

The
        European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain
        Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("RoHS
        Directive") and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE
        Directive”). The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws
        prohibiting the use of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium
        and
        chromium, in certain electronic products put on the market after July 1,
        2006.
        The WEEE Directive requires EU member states to enact laws that come into
        effect
        by August 13, 2005 regulating the collection, recovery and recycling of waste
        from certain electronic products. We have established a program in order
        to
        comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted by the EU member
        states. We are modifying the design of our products and/or modifying our
        manufacturing processes and/or using different components in our products
        in
        order to comply with such laws and regulations.

In
        addition, the State of California has enacted legislation similar to the
        RoHS
        Directive that comes into effect on January 1, 2007 and other states and
        countries, including the People’s Republic of China, have proposed legislation
        similar to the RoHS Directive and the WEEE Directive. The cost of compliance
        with such legislation cannot yet be determined but may be
        substantial.

Employees

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, Garmin had 3,034 full-time employees worldwide, of whom
        1,322
        were in the United States, 1,628 were in Taiwan and 84 were in the United
        Kingdom. None of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered
        by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations
        to
        be good.


Item
        1A. Risk Factors

The
        risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
        risks
        and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe
        to be
        immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
        risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could
        be
        materially adversely affected.

Risks
        Related to the Company

Our
        Global Positioning System products depend upon satellites maintained by the
        United States Department of Defense. If a significant number of these satellites
        become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies of
        the
        United States government for the use of the Global Positioning System without
        charge are changed or if there is interference with Global Positioning System
        signals, our business will suffer.

The
        Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning
        system
        consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and
        their
        ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the
        United
        States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently
        charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their
        ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic
        and
        mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally
        designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile
        space environment in which they operate. However, of the current deployment
        of
        satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 13 years.

If
        a
        significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or
        are
        not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning
        System products and would have a material negative effect on our business.
        In
        addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain
        committed to the operation and maintenance of Global Positioning System
        satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government
        that
        provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge and without
        accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing commercial
        applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies
        may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of
        Global
        Positioning System signals. However, in a presidential policy statement issued
        in December 2004, the Bush administration stated that the U.S. is committed
        to
        supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will continue
        providing it free from direct user fees.

Some
        of
        our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the
        Wide
        Area Augmentation System (WAAS). WAAS is operated by the Federal Aviation
        Administration. Any curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could
        result
        in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby
        impacting our markets.

Any
        of
        the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products
        to
        select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based
        on
        competing technologies.

A
        shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation
        would harm our business.

On
        September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft
        operated by commercial air carriers, resulting in major loss of life and
        property. Following the terrorist attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration
        (“FAA”) ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several
        days. In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation
        industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented
        by the
        FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The FAA
        restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around
        the
        30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas. The Aircraft Owners
        and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected
        approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside
        the
        30 enhanced Class B airspace areas. The AOPA estimates that approximately
        90% of
        all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general
        aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules
        (IFR).


The
        shut
        down of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of
        our
        general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products
        manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility
        in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new
        and
        existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any
        future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general
        aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
        results.

Any
        reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the
        reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm
        our
        business.

Our
        Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard
        Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning
        System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency
        bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
        The
        assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known
        as
        the International Telecommunications Union (‘‘ITU’’). The Federal Communications
        Commission (‘‘FCC’’) is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for
        non-government use in the United States in accordance with ITU regulations.
        Any
        ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency
        band
        segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception
        of Global Positioning System signals and may materially and adversely affect
        the
        utility and reliability of our products, which would, in turn, have a material
        adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, emissions from mobile
        satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands
        or
        inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of
        our
        products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating
        results. The FCC continually receives proposals for new technologies and
        services, such as ultra-wideband technologies, which may seek to operate
        in, or
        across, the radio frequency bands currently used by the GPS SPS. Adverse
        decisions by the FCC that result in harmful interference to the delivery
        of the
        GPS SPS may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of
        our
        products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business
        and
        financial condition.

If
        we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely
        manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We
        expect
        that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived
        from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products is
        characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards
        and
        changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify
        or
        improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry
        standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive
        or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research
        and
        development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing
        products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However, there
        can be
        no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed
        or,
        if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If
        we are
        unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and
        enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be
        adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial
        time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to
        technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms
        that we
        can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to
        obtain
        on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies
        as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products
        are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve
        timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability
        of
        these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important
        to our
        future success. We have previously experienced delays in shipping certain
        of our
        products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays,
        manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval,
        or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


If
        we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able
        to
        secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products
        or we
        could have costly excess production or inventories.

Historically,
        we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although
        we did
        experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to
        declining economic conditions and the shut down of U.S. airspace as a result
        of
        the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. We have generally
        been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. However,
        the
        demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to
        forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand
        as we
        introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market
        for our
        products intensifies. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could
        cause the following problems in our operations:

§

If demand increases beyond what we
                forecast,
                we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on
                suppliers
                to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might
                not
                be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected
                demand.

§

Rapid increases in production levels
                to meet
                unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing
                and
                supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could
                lower
                our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly,
                manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins
                and
                reduce customer satisfaction.

§

If forecasted demand does not develop,
                we
                could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished
                products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs
                of some or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand
                could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced
                manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result
                in lower
                margins.

We
        may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If
        our
        aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions
        or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
        Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could
        cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
        If
        any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability
        for
        personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could
        be
        subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against
        accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no
        assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages
        to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially
        reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover
        awards of punitive damages. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance
        to
        cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover
        the
        award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial
        condition and results of operations.

We
        depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific
        components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers
        are
        not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or
        if the
        costs of components rise.

We
        are
        dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current
        products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers
        include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays,
        memory chips and microprocessors. The cost, quality and availability of
        components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
        Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain
        application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs
        are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may
        not be
        currently available for these sole source components.

In
        the
        past (including in the first half of 2004) we have experienced shortages
        of
        liquid crystal displays and other components. In addition, if there are
        shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
        If
        suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis
        and if
        we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative
        source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to
        maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously
        harmed.

We
        license mapping data for use in our products from various sources. There
        are
        only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical
        region.
        If we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to
        obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is
        prohibitive, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would
        be
        seriously harmed.


We
        rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and
        disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because
        we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors,
        we
        are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels
        and
        support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain
        significant levels of our products in their inventories. If dealers and
        distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not
        maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be
        negatively impacted.

Many
        of
        our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
        If
        our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms,
        those
        dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
        In
        the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of
        qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful
        relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution
        channels, our business will suffer.

Failure
        to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our
        business.

Our
        ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan
        in a
        rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process.
        We continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and
        internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially.
        This
        growth has placed, and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue
        to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources.

Our
        business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified
        personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our
        future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key
        executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative
        personnel. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our
        key
        executive officers. We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key
        executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
        The
        loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key
        employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled
        personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult. For
        example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified
        electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design
        and develop new products and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging
        to
        recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees,
        we
        may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

Our
        sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Recently
        gross margins on our consumer products have been reduced because of higher
        than
        normal price reductions on older products and a shift in the product mix
        as
        automotive products continue to become a larger portion of revenue for our
        consumer product segment. Our sales and gross margins for our products may
        fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product
        mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices
        of
        a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such
        decreases, we intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
        corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and
        on
        introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore
        can be
        sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance
        that
        we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions
        or
        introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent that such cost
        reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner
        or our
        products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition
        and
        results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As we introduce
        new product lines that serve personal digital assistant (“PDA”), and original
        equipment manufacturer automotive and sensor board applications, we may
        experience a decline in our overall gross margins from sales of these
        potentially high volume but low margin product lines.


Our
        quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our
        operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating
        results may fluctuate significantly. If this occurs, the price of our stock
        would likely decline. As we expand our operations, our operating expenses,
        particularly our sales, marketing and research and development costs, may
        increase as a percentage of our sales. If revenues decrease and we are unable
        to
        reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically,
        our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of
        each
        fiscal year and have, from time to time, been lower than the preceding quarter.
        Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally
        lower in these quarters. Sales of certain of our consumer

products
        tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer
        spending for such products during the recreational marine and fishing season.
        Sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our fourth
        fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic
        devices
        during the holiday season.

In
        addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with
        relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters,
        which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Our
        quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency
        translation.

Our
        Taiwan subsidiary holds, and is expected to continue to hold, significant
        cash,
        cash equivalents, and marketable securities and receivables denominated in
        U.S.
        Dollars. Because the U.S. Dollar is the primary currency for our business
        and in
        order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in
        the
        exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar and the New Taiwan Dollar on these assets,
        management expects that the Taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority
        of these assets in U.S. Dollar or U.S. Dollar denominated instruments.
        Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting
        period
        to translate into New Taiwan dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets
        held by our Taiwan subsidiary. This translation is required because the New
        Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. This U.S.
        GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our
        financial statements as the New Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
        Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. Because
        there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management
        will continue to focus on the Company’s operating performance before the impact
        of the foreign currency translation.

If
        we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our
        resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions,
        fewer
        customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The
        markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition
        to
        increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater
        financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors
        may
        be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes
        in
        customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources
        to the
        development, promotion and sale of their products. Increased competition
        could
        result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss
        of
        market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future
        competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.

Our
        intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could
        suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by
        others.

We
        rely
        on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,
        confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
        our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents
        and
        registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect
        our
        rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that
        our
        patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark
        applications will become registered trademarks. Moreover, even if approved,
        our
        patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others
        or
        otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. Thus, any patents
        or
        trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a
        significant competitive advantage.


Third
        parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
        Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
        condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of
        patents. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is
        costly
        and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could
        refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. We
        might
        not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. Such infringement
        claims
        could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or
        permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the
        production or sale of major products.

Failure
        to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could
        harm
        our business.

We
        have
        certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to
        governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
        Federal Aviation Administration (‘‘FAA’’) certification is required for all of
        our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated
        aircraft. To the extent required, certification is an expensive and
        time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. An
        inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications
        could
        have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, therefore,
        our operating results.

In
        addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be
        decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our
        operating results.

Our
        business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with
        international sales and operations.

Our
        business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
        We
        estimate that approximately 38% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended
        December 31, 2005 represented products shipped to international destinations.
        Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations
        could
        be harmed by a variety of international factors, including:

§

changes in foreign currency exchange
                rates;

§

changes in a specific country’s or region’s
                political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging
                markets;

§

trade protection measures and import
                or
                export licensing requirements;

§

potentially negative consequences
                from
                changes in tax laws;

§

difficulty in managing widespread
                sales and
                manufacturing operations; and

§

less effective protection of intellectual
                property.

We
        may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies
        that operate in Taiwan.

Relations
        between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC,
        and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan
        in
        the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
        and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
        Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products,
        except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan
        has a unique international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty
        over
        all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland
        China.
        The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
        Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established
        during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated
        that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain
        circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. Relations
        between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market
        value
        of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan
        in
        the future.


There
        is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil
        liabilities in the Cayman Islands and Taiwan.

We
        are a
        Cayman Islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located
        outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be
        difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
        In
        addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands
        or
        Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained
        against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities
        laws
        of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original
        actions brought in the Cayman Islands or Taiwan against us predicated upon
        the
        securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

Our
        shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because
        we are
        incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our
        corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association,
        as
        amended, and by the Companies Law (2004 Revision) and the common law of the
        Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
        responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly
        established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
        jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty
        in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management, directors
        or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation
        incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively
        less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike
        many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not
        specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or
        consolidation of a company. This may make it more difficult for you to assess
        the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation
        or
        to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe
        the
        consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders
        of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights
        under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to
        obtain
        copies of lists of shareholders of the company. This may make it more difficult
        for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary
        for a
        shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection
        with a proxy contest.

Subject
        to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may
        not
        bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands
        counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having
        been brought in a Cayman Islands court.

We
        may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or
        other
        ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully
        identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We
        intend
        to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments
        in
        complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter
        into
        any strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets,
        additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise.
        In
        October 2005, we acquired MotionBased Technologies, LLC. We currently have
        no
        commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions, or to enter
        into
        strategic partnerships. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition,
        investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable
        candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions
        on
        commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any
        future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations
        and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other
        business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may
        result
        in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management
        teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide
        not to
        work for us. Our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired
        organizations and products into our operations. We may not successfully
        integrate any operations, personnel or products that we may acquire in the
        future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business
        could be materially harmed.


We
        have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered
        on
        certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our
        effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate, because
        we
        have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology
        investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant
        effect on our financial results in the future.

Changes
        in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax
        law
        could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We
        do not
        believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently
        a
‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for United States federal income tax
        purposes. We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
        However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is
        made
        annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control
        and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company
        tests are not entirely clear, we cannot assure that we will not become a
        passive
        foreign investment company. If we are a passive foreign investment company
        in
        any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could
        be
        liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon
        some
        distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a
        gain.
        Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in
        any
        year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will
        continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect
        to
        such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue
        to
        satisfy the income or asset tests described above. Additional tax considerations
        would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign
        corporation.

Risks
        Relating to Our Shares

The
        volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common
        shares.

The
        market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly
        volatile. During 2005, the closing price of our common shares ranged from
        a low
        of $39.50 to a high of $70.41. A variety of factors could cause the price
        of our
        common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

announcements
                  and rumors of developments related to our business or the industry
                  in
                  which we compete;

·

quarterly
                  fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating
                  results;

·

the
                  availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components,
                  such as
                  flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our
                  products;

·

general
                  conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in
                  interest
                  rates;

·

announcements
                  of technological innovations;

·

new
                  products or product enhancements by us or our
                  competitors;

·

product
                  obsolescence and our ability to manage product
                  transitions;

·

developments
                  in patents or other intellectual property rights and
                  litigation;

·

developments
                  in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;
                  and

·

any
                  significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan
                  or
                  significant markets where we sell our
                  products.


In
        addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for
        shares
        of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
        fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance
        of
        affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect
        the market price of our common shares, and the market price of our common
        shares
        may decline.

Our
        officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As
        of
        February 28, 2006 members and former members of our Board of Directors and
        our
        executive officers, together with members of their families and entities
        that
        may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially
        own approximately 44% of our outstanding common shares. Accordingly, these
        shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring
        shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. This level of ownership
        may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change
        in
        control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of
        other
        holders of our common shares.

Provisions
        in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter, delay
        or
        prevent a third party from acquiring us and Cayman Islands corporate law
        may
        impede a takeover, which could decrease the value of our shares.

Our
        Board
        of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 preferred shares
        and to
        determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
        voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the
        shareholders. This could have an adverse impact on the market price of our
        common shares. We have no present plans to issue any preferred shares, but
        we
        may do so. The rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to,
        and
        adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares
        that
        may be issued in the future. In addition, we have adopted a classified board
        of
        directors. Our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire
        board of directors without a super majority vote. In addition, a super majority
        vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders.
        Shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting. We have
        adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would
        significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us
        without prior approval of our Board of Directors. This shareholders’ rights plan
        and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult
        for a
        third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders.

Unlike
        many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not provide
        for
        mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the United
        States. While Cayman Islands law does have statutory provisions that provide
        for
        the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are commonly referred
        to
        in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement,” the procedural and legal
        requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous
        and
        take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate
        a
        merger in the United States. Under Cayman Islands law and practice, a scheme
        of
        arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands exempted company must
        be
        approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders
        who are present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at such meeting.
        The
        shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at
        least
        75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders (excluding the
        shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement) present and voting
        at
        the meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also sanction the
        convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation. Although there
        is
        no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved
        in
        the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks to ensure that
        the
        creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving
        entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely
        affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand Court will only approve
        a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

•
the
        statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

•
the
        shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

•
the
        scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve;
        and

•
the
        scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under
        some other

provision
        of the Companies Law.

Garmin
        International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc., occupy a facility of approximately
        750,000 square feet on 42 acres in Olathe, Kansas, where the majority of

Encyclopedia
        Britannica, Inc. v. Alpine Electronics of America, Inc., Alpine Electronics,
        Inc., Denso Corporation, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., American Honda
        Motor
        Co., Inc., and Garmin International, Inc.

On
        May
        16, 2005, Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. filed suit in the United States District
        Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, against the Company’s
        wholly owned subsidiary Garmin International, Inc. (“Garmin International”) and
        five other unrelated companies, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.
        5,241,671. Garmin International has filed responsive pleadings and the parties
        have agreed to stay discovery pending a claim construction ruling by the
        court.
        On December 30, 2005, Garmin International filed a Motion for Summary Judgment
        for Claim Invalidity Based on Indefiniteness. On March 1, 2006 the Court
        held a
        hearing on construction of the claims of the patent in suit. Although there
        can
        be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this dispute would not have
        a
        material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
        of
        operations, we believe that the claims are without merit and we will vigorously
        defend the action.


From
        time
        to time the Company is involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary
        course of our business. We believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions
        will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and
        results of operations.

Item
      7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

The
        following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
        of
        operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations,
        certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and
        business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial
        statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in
        conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related
        information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial
        statements (including the notes thereto and the report of independent auditors
        thereon), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form
        10-K,
        as well as the risk factors discussed above in Item 1A.

As
        previously noted, the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions
        of
        this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events. Readers
        can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs
        as
“expects”, “anticipates”, “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such
        verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove
        incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results
        could
        materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
        The
        differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors
        including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers
        are
        strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such
        forward-looking statement. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking
        statements in this Form 10-K.

The
        Company’s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the
        calendar year. Fiscal year 2005 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for
        fiscal years 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Unless otherwise stated, all years
        and
        dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods. Unless the context
        otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and
        similar
        terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless
        otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands,
        except per share data.

Overview

We
        are a
        leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
        devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
        technology. We operate in two business segments, the consumer and aviation
        markets. Both of our segments offer products through our network of independent
        dealers and distributors. However, the nature of products and types of customers
        for the two segments vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed
        separately. Our consumer segment includes portable GPS receivers and accessories
        for marine, recreation, land and automotive applications sold primarily to
        retail outlets. Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics
        for
        Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold
        primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.

Since
        our
        first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income
        from
        operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits. Our sales
        have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 29% since 2001 and our
        net
        income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 29% since 2001.
        The
        vast majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of
        new
        revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies
        in
        2003, and this acquisition had no significant impact on net income for that
        year.

Since
        our
        principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience
        some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results. The functional
        currency of our European operations is the U.S. dollar (effective in 2001)
        and
        the functional currency of our Asian operations is the New Taiwan Dollar.
        Less
        than 25 percent of transactions of our European operations are now denominated
        in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro. We experienced $15.3 million, $(24.8)
        million, $(6.7) million, $0.0 million, and $11.6 million in foreign currency
        gains (losses) during fiscal years 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
        respectively. To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions with
        the
        European Dollar, the British Pound Sterling or the New Taiwan Dollar, although
        we may utilize hedging transactions in the future.


Critical
        Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

The
        Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
        operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which
        have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
        in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires
        the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
        of
        assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
        assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its
        estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives,
        product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets,
        income
        taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. The Company
        bases
        its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
        are
        believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
        the
        basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
        that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
        from
        these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue
        Recognition

The
        Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs
        returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection, promotions
        and other volume-based incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on
        estimates and judgements using historical experience and expectation of future
        conditions. Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company’s
        operating results. These incentives are accrued for on a percentage of sales
        basis and reviewed periodically. If market conditions were to decline, the
        Company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly
        resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive
        is
        offered.

Warranties

The
        Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging
        from one to two years. The Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated
        costs to provide warranty services. The Company’s estimate of costs to service
        its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation
        of
        future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty
        claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims,
        its
        warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross
        profit.

Inventory

The
        Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
        inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the
        estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
        conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
        by management, additional inventory write-downs may be
        required.

Investments

Investments
        are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized
        investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity. Investment
        income is recorded when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized
        when
        investments are sold. Investments are reviewed periodically to determine
        if they
        have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
        If
        investments are determined to be impaired, a capital loss is recognized at
        the
        date of determination.

Testing
        for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement.
        The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination
        of
        their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other
        than temporary are the key judgement elements. The discovery of new information
        and the passage of time can significantly change these judgements. Revisions
        of
        impairment judgements are made when new information becomes known, and any
        resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
        and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining
        fair
        value and assessing investment impairment.


Income
        Taxes

The
        Company provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference
        between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount
        for
        financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws
        that
        will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. While no
        valuation allowance has been recorded, it is the Company’s policy to record a
        valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it
        believes is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has
        considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
        strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event
        the
        Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part
        of
        its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred
        tax
        assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
        Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its
        deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an
        adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period
        such
        determination was made.

In
        addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
        uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
        liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
        based
        on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will
        be
        due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the
        reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized
        in the
        period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our
        estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment,
        a
        further charge to expense would result.

Stock
        Based Compensation

The
        Company distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SAR’s”) each
        year as part of the Company’s compensation package for employees. Employees with
        certain levels of responsibility within the Company are eligible for stock
        option or SAR grants, but the granting of options is at the discretion of
        the
        Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual
        obligation. Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 11 of
        the
        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting
        Terms and Characteristics

Net
        Sales

Our
        net
        sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor
        network and to original equipment manufacturers. We recognize sales when
        products are shipped. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore
        backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
        We
        aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically
        ship
        most orders within 72 hours.

Net
        sales
        are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer
        products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during
        the
        spring and summer marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased
        demand during the holiday buying season. Our aviation products do not experience
        much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release
        of
        new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.


Gross
        Profit

Raw
        material costs are our most significant cost item. In 2005 we experienced
        a
        shift in product mix to lower-margin product groups and price declines related
        to increased competition, both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive
        navigation product line. We experienced shortages in certain high technology
        components in early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on components
        in the
        first half of 2004, much of which was alleviated by the end of the fiscal
        year.
        We experienced upward pricing pressures on our high technology components
        in
        late 2003, but offset much of those with efficiencies in our manufacturing
        processes.

Our
        existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
        in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from
        different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit
        us
        to use these lower cost components. We believe that because of our practice
        of
        performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house,
        our
        Shijr, Taiwan, Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants have
        experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing, compared to our competition.
        In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume
        products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan
        than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales
        price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross
        profit. In the past, prices of some of our devices sold into the consumer
        market
        have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold
        at
        lower price points. The average selling prices of our aviation products have
        increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products
        sold
        at higher prices. The effect of the sales price variability inherent within
        the
        mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross
        profit.

Selling,
        General and Administrative Expenses

Our
        selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries
                  for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries
                  and related costs for executives and administrative
                  personnel;

·

advertising,
                  marketing, and other brand building
                  costs;

·

accounting
                  and legal costs;

·

information
                  systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel
                  and related costs; and

·

occupancy
                  and other overhead costs.

With
        the
        expected increase of total revenues in the future, we expect selling, general
        and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
        We intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus
        on
        individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer
        marketplace, especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand
        opportunities in rapidly growing markets like the portable automobile
        navigation, which is becoming a mass market. We also intend to increase our
        customer call center support as our consumer segment continues to grow. We
        also
        anticipate increased selling, general, and administrative costs associated
        with
        information technology staffing and support activities.

Research
        and Development

The
        majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our
        engineers, costs for high technology components used in product and prototype
        development, and costs of test equipment needed during product development.
        Approximately 87% of the research and development of our products is performed
        in the United States. The remainder of our research and development activities
        are performed by our Taiwan engineering group, which has increased in size
        in
        recent years.


We
        are
        committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of
        new
        products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer
        and
        aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices. We continue
        to
        grow our research and development budget in absolute terms.

Customers

No
        customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in the year ended December
        31,
        2005. Our top ten customers have contributed between 25% and 30% of net sales
        since 2001. We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts
        receivable between 35 and 61 days since 2001. The average sales days in our
        customer accounts receivable was 61 days as of December 31, 2005. We have
        experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days
        due to
        changes in product mix and longer payment terms, and anticipate maintaining
        approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going
        forward.

Income
        Taxes

We
        have
        experienced a relatively low effective tax rate in Taiwan due to lower marginal
        tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government
        on
        certain high-technology capital investments, and other Taiwan tax credits
        due to
        expected repatriation of 2005 earnings. Therefore, profits earned in Taiwan
        have
        been taxed at a lower rate than those in the United States and Europe. As
        a
        result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 16.5 percent
        during 2005. We have taken advantage of this tax benefit in Taiwan since
        our
        inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates
        at
        least through 2010. The current Taiwan tax incentives for which Garmin has
        received approval will end in 2010. We plan on applying for additional
        incentives for years beyond 2010 based on capital investments we expect to
        make
        in the future. However, there can be no assurance that such tax incentives
        will
        be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which
        we
        apply. Management believes that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 will
        be
        slightly lower than fiscal 2005. The actual effective tax rate will be dependent
        upon the production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal
        2005, and composition of our earnings.

The
          increase in total net sales during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the
          introduction of 55 new products and overall demand for our consumer and
          aviation
          products. Total consumer and aviation units sold increased 31% to 3,028,000
          in
          2005 from 2,306,000 in 2004. In general, management believes that continuous
          innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future
          revenue
          growth.

The
          Company’s revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth
          quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters.
          In 2005 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern, with increases
          each
          quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases
          across all product lines. The revenue increase in second quarter was primarily
          attributable to initial sell-in of popular new portable automobile navigation
          products, the onset of the marine selling season, and Father’s Day purchases.
          The revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to
          new
          product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling
          season. Revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing
          of new
          product introductions.

The
          increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction
          of 40
          new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total
          units sold were up 31%. It is management’s belief that the continued demand for
          the Company’s consumer products is due to the expansion of the GPS market in
          general, and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and
          applications of GPS, particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile
          navigation.

The
          increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased
          sales
          from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers)
          and retrofit markets. Sales of the G1000 integrated glass cockpit was the
          primary reason for increased OEM sales in 2005. While Temporary Flight
          Restrictions

(TFR's)
          continue to impact general aviation, the flying community is adapting to
          these
          changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers. Should the Federal
          Aviation Administration (FAA) impose more restrictions, or elect to shutdown
          U.S. airspace in the future, these factors could have a material adverse
          effect
          on our business.

The
          increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction
          of 40 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation
          products. The reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to
          reduced
          prices on older consumer products in advance of new product releases, a
          change
          in product mix towards certain lower gross margin consumer product lines
          such as
          the automotive product line, and reduced prices on certain consumer products
          due
          to increased competition. Management believes that the trend to lower consumer
          gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive
          products increase at a faster rate than the rest of the consumer
          segment.

The
          increase in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product
          mix
          within our OEM and retrofit products as the G1000 product line began a
          second
          year of selling into new aircraft and program costs were no longer a significant
          cost in this business segment.

Selling,
          General and Administrative Expenses

The
            increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment
            generally across the organization (net increase of over 400 non-engineering
            employees), significantly increased advertising costs (up 101%) associated
            primarily with consumer products, increased information technology staffing
            and
            support costs, increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to
            increase
            focus on specific target markets, and additional staffing in our customer
            call
            center. Management expects that in spite of strong demand for our products,
            selling, general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat
            as a
            percentage of sales during fiscal 2006 due to increased advertising and
            marketing activities intended to build awareness of the Garmin brand
            and demand
            for Garmin product worldwide.

Research
            and Development Expenses

The
              increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable
              to the
              addition of 142 associates to our research and development team during
              fiscal
              2005. Management believes that one of the key

strategic
              initiatives for future growth and success of the Company is continuous
              innovation, development, and introduction of new products. Management
              expects
              that its research and development expenses will increase approximately
              25% - 30%
              during fiscal 2006 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated
              introduction of approximately 50 new products for fiscal 2006. Management
              expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new
              products
              and technology in order to maintain the Company’s competitive advantage in the
              markets in which it competes.

Other
        income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense
        and
        foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was
        significantly higher in fiscal 2005 relative to fiscal 2004, with the majority
        of this difference caused by increased interest income and foreign currency
        gains in 2005. Interest income for fiscal 2005 increased due to higher interest
        rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year,
        increasing the returns on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents.

During
        fiscal 2005, the Company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of $15.3
        million, as the U.S. Dollar strengthened versus the New Taiwan Dollar ($32.84
        NTD/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2004 (32.19 NTD/USD). During fiscal
        2004,
        the Company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of $24.8 million,
        as
        the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New Taiwan Dollar (32.19 NTD/USD) relative
        to the end of fiscal 2003 (34.05 NTD/USD).

Income
        Tax Provision

Income
        tax expense increased by $11.9 million, to $61.4 million, for fiscal year
        from $49.5 million for fiscal year 2004 due to our higher taxable income.
        The
        effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal 2005 versus 19.4% for fiscal 2004.
        The
        decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan
        as a
        result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
        in
        Taiwan, tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of
        our
        Taiwan earnings to our parent company, and the increased contribution to
        our
        income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2005 relative to 2004. This lower
        effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a
        percentage of revenue of approximately 0.5% from fiscal 2004 to fiscal
        2005.

Net
        Income

As
        a
        result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 51% to $311.2
        million for fiscal year 2005 compared to $205.7 million for fiscal year
        2004.

Comparison
        of Fiscal Years Ended December 25, 2004 and December 27,


Net
        Sales

The
          increase in total net sales during fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the
          introduction of 50 new products and overall demand for our consumer and
          aviation
          products. Total consumer and aviation units sold increased 12.0% to 2,306,000
          in
          2004 from 2,066,000 in 2003.

The
          Company’s revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth
          quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters.
          In 2004, however, revenues increased each consecutive quarter due to the
          impact
          of new product releases across all product lines. The revenue increase
          in third
          quarter was primarily attributable to initial G1000 cockpit sales, the
          onset of
          the marine selling season and Father’s Day purchases. The increase in revenues
          in the third quarter was due to new product releases and delivery of backorders
          placed during the second quarter. The revenue increase in the fourth quarter
          was
          primarily attributable to new product releases and sales associated with
          the
          traditional holiday selling season. Revenues can also be impacted in any
          given
          quarter by the timing of new product introductions.

The
          increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction
          of 35
          new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total
          units sold were up 12%. It is management’s belief that the continued demand for
          the Company’s consumer products was due to the emergence of the GPS market in
          general, and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and
          applications of GPS.

The
          increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased
          sales
          from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers)
          and retrofit markets and sales from Garmin AT, Inc., which was acquired
          during
          the third quarter of 2003.

Gross
          Profit

The
            increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction
            of 35 new products and overall demand for our consumer products. The
            reduction
            in gross margin percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older
            products
            in advance of new product releases, a change in product mix towards certain
            lower gross margin product lines and increases in certain raw material
            costs
            early in the fiscal year. Upward pricing pressure on certain raw materials
            components in early 2004 generally abated by the end of the year.

The
            decrease in consumer gross margin was attributable to higher component
            costs
            early in the year, higher than normal price reductions on older products
            in
            advance of the release of 35 new products during the year, and a shift
            in
            product mix, as automotive products became a larger portion of revenue
            for our
            consumer products segment.

The
            decrease in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product
            mix
            within our OEM and retrofit products as the G1000 product line began
            selling
            into new aircraft.

Selling,
            General and Administrative Expenses


The
        increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment
        generally across the organization (net increase of over 400 non-engineering
        employees), significantly increased advertising costs (up 33%) associated
        primarily with consumer products, ORACLE software implementation costs, and
        additional staffing in our customer call center. In the past, selling, general
        and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues due to
        strong demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products.

Research
        and Development Expenses

The
          increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable
          to the
          addition of 52 associates to our research and development team during fiscal
          2004 and the Garmin AT engineering team contributing for the full fiscal
          year.

            significantly lower in fiscal 2004, relative to fiscal year 2003, with
            the
            majority of this difference caused by foreign currency losses in 2004.
            Interest
            income for fiscal 2004 increased due to larger cash and marketable securities
            balances during the year, increasing the returns on the Company’s cash and cash
            equivalents. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2004, due primarily
            to the
            retirement of $20 million of outstanding long-term debt during fiscal
            2003.

During
            fiscal 2004 the Company experienced foreign currency exchange losses
            of $24.8
            million, as the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New Taiwan Dollar (32.19
            NTD/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2003 (34.05 NTD/USD). During fiscal
            the Company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of $6.7 million,
            as the
            U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New Taiwan Dollar (34.05 NTD/USD) relative
            to
            the end of fiscal 2002 (35.10 NTD/USD).

Income
            Tax Provision


Income
            tax expense increased by $2.2 million, to $49.5 million, for fiscal year
            from $47.3 million for fiscal year 2003 due to our higher taxable income.
            The
            effective tax rate was 19.4% for fiscal 2004 versus 20.9% for fiscal
            2003. The
            decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from
            Taiwan as a
            result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
            in
            Taiwan, and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax
            jurisdictions during 2004 relative to 2003.

Net
            Income

As
            a
            result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 15.2%
            to $205.7
            million for fiscal year 2004 compared to $178.6 million for fiscal year
            2003.

Liquidity
            and Capital Resources

Net
            cash
            generated by operations was $247.0 million, $208.9 million, and $173.5
            million
            for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We operate with
            a
            customer-oriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory
            to meet
            customer demand. Because we desire to respond quickly to our customers
            and
            minimize order fulfillment time, our inventory levels are generally substantial
            enough to meet most demand. We also attempt to carry sufficient inventory
            levels
            of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal
            an impact
            as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products. We significantly
            increased our finished goods inventories in 2005 in anticipation of new
            product
            releases in the first half of 2006. In addition, we prefer to have sufficient
            finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products. Raw
            materials and finished goods inventory levels also continued to grow
            as a
            function of our growing sales. We anticipate days of inventory to stabilize
            at
            current levels in 2006 although absolute dollars of inventory will continue
            to
            rise, reflecting the growth of our businesses.

Capital
            expenditures in 2005 totaled $27.1 million, a decrease of $51.0 million
            from
            fiscal 2004. This amount in 2005 reflects ordinary capital expenditures
            for
            fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, our capital expenditures totaled $78.1
            million.
            The expenditures in fiscal 2004 were primarily related to the completion
            of
            expansion of our Olathe, Kansas facility ($47 million) and normal
            ongoing capital expenditures ($31 million).

We
            have
            budgeted approximately $50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal
            2006 to
            include the purchase and renovation of an additional manufacturing facility
            in
            Chung-Li, Taiwan, normal ongoing capital expenditures, and purchases
            of
            production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the Shijr, Taiwan
            facility.

In
            addition to capital expenditures, in 2005 cash flow used in investing
            related to
            the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment
            of our
            on-hand cash balances and approximately $3.6 million of intangible assets.
            The
            Company’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2005 was approximately
            3.1%. In addition to capital expenditures, in 2004 cash flow used in
            investing
            related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the
            investment of our on-hand cash balances and approximately $1.8 million
            of
            intangible assets. It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent
            with the Company’s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of
            Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital,
            maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within
            the
            constraint of maximum safety. The Company’s average return on its investments
            during fiscal year 2004 was approximately 1.7%.

Cash
            flow
            related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2005
            of $70.9
            million. During 2005, the Company repurchased 638,000 shares of its common
            shares under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved
            by
            the Board of Directors on April 21, 2004 and expires on April 30, 2006.
            Sources
            and uses in financing activities during 2005 related primarily to uses
            for the
            payment of a dividend ($54.0 million) and stock repurchase ($26.7 million),
            and
            a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise
            of
            employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan ($9.7 million).
            Cash
            flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in
            2004 of
            $51.1 million. During 2004, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares of
            its common
            shares under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program. Sources and
            uses in
            financing activities during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment
            of a
            dividend ($54.1 million) and stock repurchase ($3.1 million), and a source
            of
            cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee
            stock
            options and the employee stock purchase plan ($6.1 million). Cash flow
            used in
            financing activities during 2003 related primarily to the payment of
            a dividend
            ($54.0 million), and reduction of our debt ($20.0 million). The Company
            retired
            approximately $20.0 million of long-term debt during fiscal 2003, which
            represented the remainder of an outstanding issue of industrial revenue
            bonds.
            The employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan
            purchases
            generated a $4.3 million source of cash in 2003.


We
            currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures
            and to
            support our working capital requirements. We expect that future cash
            requirements will principally be for capital expenditures and working
            capital
            requirements.

Cash
            dividends paid to shareholders were $54.0 million, $54.1 million, and
            $54.0
            million during fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

We
            believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations
            will be
            sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital
            and other
            cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2008.

Item
            7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
            Risk

Market
            Sensitivity

We
            have
            market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products
            and
            services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials
            costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
            Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to
            offset
            pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product
            mix
            and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials
            costs.

Inflation

We
            do not
            believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial
            condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject
            to
            significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset
            such
            higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do
            so could
            adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
            operations.


Foreign
            Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The
            operation of the Company’s subsidiaries in international markets results in
            exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not
            been
            significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because, until
            recently,
            the New Taiwan Dollar has proven to be relatively stable. However, periodically
            we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due
            to the
            strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile
            foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant
            effect
            on our results of operations.

The
            principal currency involved is the New Taiwan Dollar. Garmin Corporation,
            located in Shijr, Taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency.
            The
            Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates
            and
            income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order
            to
            minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net
            assets, we
            have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in
            marketable securities in U.S. dollars. As discussed above, the New Taiwan
            dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate can be volatile.

The
            exchange rate increased 2.0% during 2005 and resulted in a foreign currency
            gain
            of $15.3 million. The exchange rate decreased 5.5% during 2004 and resulted
            in a
            foreign currency loss of $24.8 million. The exchange rate decreased 3.0%
            during
            2003 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of $6.7 million.

A
            10%
            positive or negative change in the US dollar exchange rate versus the
            New Taiwan
            Dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of $76.5 million
            (positive
            10% change) or a foreign currency loss of $76.5 million (negative 10%
            change)
            during 2005. The majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in U.S.
            Dollars.
            Therefore, the impact on sales related to foreign currency movements
            is
            minimal.

Interest
            Rate Risk

We
            have
            no outstanding long-term debt, and therefore no debt-related interest
            rate risk.

We
            are
            exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable
            securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses
            associated
            with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. A hypothetical change
            of 10%
            in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized
            gains or
            losses. At December 31, 2005, unrealized losses on those securities were
            $3.3
            million.

Notes

Report
            of Ernst & Young, LLP

Independent
            Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
            Board
            of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
            Ltd.

We
            have
            audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and
            Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004,
            and
            the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity,
            and cash
            flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.
            Our
            audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index
            at
            Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
            of
            the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
            on these
            financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
            conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
            financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
            on a
            test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
            statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
            used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
            financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
            a
            reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
            our
            opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
            all
            material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd.
            and
            Subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 and the consolidated
            results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
            years in
            the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
            accepted
            accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
            schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
            taken as
            a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
            forth
            therein.

We
            also
            have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Garmin Ltd. and
            Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December
            31, 2005,
            based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
            issued by
            the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            and our
            report dated March 1, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
            thereon.

        Organization

On
        July
        24, 2000, the stockholders of Garmin Corporation (GARMIN) incorporated Garmin
        Ltd. (the Company) under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Subsequently, the
        stockholders of GARMIN executed a Shareholder’s Agreement to exchange with
        Garmin Ltd. their investments in 88,988,394 shares of common stock of GARMIN
        for
        100,000,000 shares of common stock of Garmin Ltd., which closed on September
        22,
        2000. This exchange was accounted for at historical cost similar to that
        in
        pooling-of-interests accounting. Until April 15, 2002, one share of GARMIN
        stock
        was held by each of six shareholders as nominees under nominee trusts in
        order
        to comply with Article 2 of the Company Law of Taiwan which required that,
        as a
“company limited by stock,” GARMIN have at least seven shareholders, and 4,000
        shares of GARMIN were held by two shareholders who did not convert their
        GARMIN
        shares to common shares of the Company. These 4,006 shares represented
        approximately 0.004% of the outstanding shares of GARMIN. Taiwan company
        law was
        subsequently changed to remove the requirement that a Taiwan company have
        a
        minimum of seven shareholders and to permit single shareholder companies.
        As of
        April 15, 2002, the Company acquired the 4,000 shares of GARMIN that were
        held
        by the two shareholders and the six nominee shareholders each transferred
        their
        own share of GARMIN stock to the Company. As a result, the Company now owns
        all
        of the outstanding shares of GARMIN. Garmin Ltd. completed an initial public
        offering of its common stock in December 2000.

History
        of Business

Garmin
        Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) manufacture, market, and
        distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related
        products. GARMIN was incorporated in Taiwan, Republic of China on January
        16,
        1990. GARMIN, wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd., is primarily responsible for the
        manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to Garmin
        International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GARMIN, and Garmin
        (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., and, to
        a
        lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s
        products in Asia and the Far East was incorporated in the United States in
        April
        1990. GII is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s
        products in many international markets and in the United States as well as
        research and new product development. GII also manufactures certain products
        for
        the Company’s aviation segment. During June 1992, GII formed GEL as a United
        Kingdom subsidiary to sell its products principally within the European market.
        During 2000, GII sold its interest in GEL to Garmin Ltd. Also during 2000,
        Garmin Realty LLC was formed by GII to hold certain real estate. In December
        2001, GII formed Garmin USA as a sales organization. During August 2003,
        GII
        acquired all the outstanding capital stock of UPS Aviation Technologies,
        Inc.
        for $38 million in cash and renamed the company Garmin AT, Inc. (GAT). See
        Note
        14. In January 2005, Garmin Ltd. formed Garmin N.V., a wholly owned Netherlands
        Antilles N.V. In February 2005, Garmin N.V. formed Garmin B.V., a wholly
        owned
        Netherlands B.V. In August 2005, Garmin Ltd. sold its shares in its Taiwan
        subsidiary, Garmin Corporation to Garmin N.V. in exchange for debt.

        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
        of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
        with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin
        Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances
        and transactions have been eliminated.


Fiscal
        Year

The
        Company has adopted a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the
        calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar
        year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including
        the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week
        fiscal
        year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain
        fiscal
        years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year
        occurs.

In
        those
        resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra
        week
        of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial
        results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter,
        will
        not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years
        and
        the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Fiscal 2004 and 2003 included
        weeks while fiscal 2005 includes 53 weeks.

Foreign
        Currency Translation

GARMIN
        utilizes the New Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. In accordance
        with
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52,

Foreign
        Currency Translation

,
        the
        financial statements of GARMIN for all periods presented have been translated
        into United States dollars, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd. and GII,
        and
        the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing
        during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for
        all
        assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate
        component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of
        ($8,693) and $12,075 as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004,
        respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss)
        in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Transactions
        in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at
        the
        transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions
        are
        translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All
        differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to an exchange
        gain of $15,265, and exchange losses of $24,819 and $6,699, for the years
        ended
        December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, respectively.
        The
        gain in fiscal 2005 was the result of strengthening of the United States
        dollar
        in the latter half of the year. The losses in fiscal 2004 and 2003 were due
        to
        weakening of the United States dollar compared to the New Taiwan Dollar
        throughout the year. These gains and losses are included in other income
        in the
        accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Earnings
        Per Share

Basic
        earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number
        of
        common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the
        number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock
        options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased
        from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s
        stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 12.

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents

For
        purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
        on
        hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
        of
        three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash
        equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those
        instruments.


Inventories

Inventories
        are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
        weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
        method) by GARMIN and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and GEL. Inventories consisted
        of the following:

Property

Property
        and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
        method over the following estimated useful lives:

                    years

                    years

Long-Lived
          Assets

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
        for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
        the
        Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
        recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
        if it
        exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the
        use
        and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying
        amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
        loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived
        asset exceeds its fair value.

Dividends

On
        July
        20, 2005 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to
        be
        paid on December 15, 2005 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2005.
        The
        Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $53,974. The dividend has been
        reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On
        July
        23, 2004 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to
        be
        paid on December 15, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2004.
        The
        Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $54,095. The dividend has been
        reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately
        $106,979 and $90,554 of GARMIN’s retained earnings are indefinitely restricted
        from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the law of Taiwan at December
        31,
        2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively.

Intangible
        Assets


At
        December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, the Company had patents, license
        agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived
        intangible assets recorded at a cost of $93,472 and $85,909, respectively.
        The
        Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
        was $13,701 at December 31, 2005 and $12,218 at December 25, 2004.

Identifiable,
        finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
        lives
        on a straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization
        was
        $61,290 and $38,642 at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 respectively.
        Amortization expense was $22,648, $20,832, and $6,886, for the years ended
        December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, respectively.
        In
        the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $17,359,
        $2,663, $1,720, $1,456, and $1,383, respectively.

Marketable
        Securities

Management
        determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the
        time
        of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet
        date.

All
        of
        the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at
        December 31, 2005. See Note 3. Available-for-sale securities are stated at
        fair
        value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other
        comprehensive gain. During 2005, unrealized losses of $2,360 were reported
        in
        other comprehensive gain, net of related taxes.

The
        amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted
        for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in
        the
        case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
        Such amortization is included in interest income from investments. Realized
        gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
        are
        included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is
        based
        on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on
        available-for-sale securities have not been material in any
        period.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance
        with
        SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
        for Income Taxes

.
        The
        liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
        based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
        their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the
        enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
        expected to reverse. Income taxes have not been accrued by Garmin Corporation
        (GC) for the unremitted earnings of GII totaling approximately $210,216 and
        $167,567 at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively, because
        such
        earnings are intended to be reinvested in this subsidiary indefinitely. At
        December 25, 2004, income taxes had also not been accrued by the Company
        for the
        unremitted earnings of GC or GEL because such earnings were also intended
        to be
        reinvested in these subsidiaries indefinitely, at that time.

The
        Company’s income tax liability balance includes tax contingencies that are
        recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken
        that could be challenged by taxing authorities. These exposures result from
        the
        varying applications of statutes, rules, regulations, and interpretations.
        The
        Company’s tax contingencies are established based on judgments about potential
        actions by taxing jurisdictions and relate to transfer pricing positions
        we have
        taken in a variety of the countries in which we operate, certain tax credits,
        and various foreign and state tax matters. The ultimate resolution of these
        matters may be materially greater or less than the amount we have accrued
        and
        could have a material effect on our effective tax rate in the period when
        such
        matter is resolved.

Use
        of Estimates

The
        preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
        financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
        from
        those estimates.


Concentration
        of Credit Risk

The
        Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s
        pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require
        security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided
        for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and consistently have
        been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended
        terms consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms
        can
        be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing
        of new product releases by the Company and the impact those releases may
        have on
        the cash flow requirements of our customers.

Revenue
        Recognition

The
        Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is shipped
        to the
        customer and title has transferred. The Company assumes no remaining significant
        obligations associated with the product sale other than that related to its
        warranty programs discussed below.

Shipping
        and Handling Costs

Shipping
        and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying
        consolidated financial statements.

Product
        Warranty

The
        Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty
        period is generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception
        of
        certain aviation products for which the warranty period is two years from
        the
        date of installation.

Sales
        Programs

The
        Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers
        based
        on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth. Additionally,
        from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain
        products. Estimated rebates and incentives payable to distributors are regularly
        reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis. In addition,
        the
        Company provides retailers with product discounts termed “price protection” to
        assist these retailers in clearing older products from their inventories
        in
        advance of new product releases. These rebates, incentives, and price
        protections are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying
        consolidated statements of income.

Advertising
        Costs

The
        Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense charged
        to
        operations amounted to approximately $59,309, $29,577, and $22,071 for the
        years
        ended December, 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003,
        respectively.

Research
        and Development

Substantially
        all research and development is performed by GII in the United States. Research
        and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately
        $74,879, $61,580, and $43,706 for the years ended December 31, 2005, December
        25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, respectively.


Customer
        Service and Technical Support

Customer
        service and free technical support costs are included on the sales and marketing
        expense line on our statements of operations. Customer service and technical
        support costs include costs associated with performing order processing,
        answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and
        other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to
        customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a
        limited
        amount of free technical support assistance to customers. The technical support
        is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. We
        accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software
        Development Costs

Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86,

“Accounting
        for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
        Marketed,”

requires
        companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until
        technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs
        are
        capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
        Our
        capitalized software development costs are not significant. SFAS 2,

“Accounting
        for Research and Development Costs,”

establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and development.
        In
        accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or
        after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in
        the
        period they are incurred and included in research and development costs on
        our
        statement of operations.

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

At
        December 31, 2005, the Company has three stock-based employee compensation
        plans, which are described more fully in Note 11. The Company accounts for
        those
        plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
        25,

Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees

,
        and
        related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected
        in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price
        equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
        The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
        share
        if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
        No.

Recently
        Issued Accounting Pronouncements

On
        December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),
        Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

.
        SFAS
        123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees

,
        and
        amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement
        of Cash Flows

.
        Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach
        described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R)
        requires

all
        share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
        to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro
        forma
        disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS
        No. 123(R) must be adopted for fiscal years beginning October 1, 2005
        or later. Early adoptions will be permitted in periods in which financial
        statements have not yet been issued. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R)
        on January 1, 2006.

SFAS
        No. 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of
        two methods:

A
        “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning
        with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS
        No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date
        and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards
        granted to employees prior to effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain
        unvested as of the effective date.

A
        “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified
        prospective described above, but also permits entities to restate based on
        the
        amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma
        disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior
        interim periods of the year of adoption.

The
        Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method.

As
        permitted by SFAS No. 123, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005,
        the Company accounted for share-based payments to employees using Opinion
        25’s
        intrinsic value method. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will
        depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However,
        had we
        adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact would have
        approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of
        pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1. The adoption of SFAS
        No. 123(R)’s fair value method is not expected to have a significant impact
        on our results of operations or on our overall financial position.

SFAS
        No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,”
amends the existing standard that provides guidance on accounting for inventory
        costs and specifically clarifies that abnormal amounts of costs should be
        recognized as period costs. This statement is effective for the fiscal year
        beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not
        expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements.

SFAS
        No. 153, “

Exchanges
        of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for
        Nonmonetary Transactions

”
        eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
        assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
        assets that do not have commercial substance. Further, the amendments made
        by
        SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
        assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
        Previously, Opinion No. 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of
        a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest
        in
        the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount
        of
        the asset relinquished. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset
        exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
        Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal
        periods beginning after the date of issuance. The provisions of this statement
        shall be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not
        expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements.

SFAS
        No. 154, “

Accounting
        Changes and Error Corrections

”
is
        a
        replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,

Accounting
        Changes

,
        and
        FASB Statement No. 3,

Reporting
        Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements

.
        Statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and
        changes the accounting for and a reporting of a change in accounting principle.
        Statement 154 requires retrospective application to the prior periods’ financial
        statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
        impracticable. Statement 154 is effective for the accounting changes and
        corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
        2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material
        effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

At
            December 31, 2005, the Company expects future costs of approximately
            $10,000 for
            the purchase of an additional manufacturing facility in Chung-Li,
            Taiwan.

Certain
            cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank securing payment
            of the
            United Kingdom value-added tax requirements. These amounted to $1,356
            and $1,457
            at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively, and are reported
            as
            restricted cash.

In
            the
            normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties
            to
            various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
            patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various
            other
            risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the
            Company
            and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal
            matters, or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company’s

management
            does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will
            have a
            material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial
            position or cash flows.

5.
            Employee Benefit Plans

GII
            sponsors an employee retirement plan under which its employees may contribute
            up
            to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code
            maximum
            limitations and to which GII contributes a specified percentage of each
            participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the Plan.
            Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees
            may
            contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation. Both GII and GEL
            contribute
            an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
            During the years ended December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004 and December
            27,
            2003, expense related to these plans of $6,378, $5,183, and $4,197, was
            charged
            to operations.

Certain
            of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit
            pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider
            final
            pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years
            ended
            December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, were significant.

                effects of

The
          Company’s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was
          $307,712, $211,093, and $202,390, for the years ended December 31, 2005,
          December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, respectively. The tax incentives
          and
          credits received from Taiwan included in the table above reflect $0.65,
          $0.45,
          and $0.38 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended
          December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, respectively.
          The
          Company currently expects to benefit from the incentives and credits being
          offered by Taiwan through 2010, at which time these tax benefits
          expire.

As
          of
          December 31, 2005, the Company decided to have its wholly owned subsidiary,
          GC
          repatriate its 2005 earnings via a dividend to its parent, Garmin B.V.
          (GBV)
          during 2006. GBV will pay the Company the entire amount of dividends it
          receives
          from GC in the form of interest expense and principal reduction on its
          loan to
          the Company. As a result of these anticipated 2006 transactions, withholding
          taxes have been accrued at December 31, 2005. Additionally, a reduction
          of the
          current tax payable was recorded at December 31, 2005 recognizing the amount
          of
          surtax that has been levied on undistributed accumulated earnings of GC
          since
          1998 for which a credit against withholding tax is available.


Deferred
          income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
          the
          carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
          and
          the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the

              Segment Information

The
              Company operates within its targeted markets through two reportable
              segments,
              those being related to products sold into the consumer and aviation
              markets.
              Both of the Company’s reportable segments offer products through the Company’s
              network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through
              OEM’s.
              However, the nature of products and types of customers for the two
              segments vary
              significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. The Company’s
              consumer segment includes portable global positioning system (GPS)
              receivers and
              accessories for marine, recreation, land, and automotive use sold primarily
              to
              retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s
              subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s aviation products are portable and panel
              mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules
              navigation
              and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft
              manufacturers.


The
              Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating
              Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM evaluates performance and allocates
              resources
              based on income before income taxes of each segment.

Income
              before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including
              certain allocated general

and
              administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency
              adjustments,
              and other non-operating corporate expenses. The accounting policies
              of the
              reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
              of
              significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or
              transfers.

The
              identifiable assets associated with each reportable segment reviewed
              by the CODM
              include accounts receivable and inventories. The Company does not report
              property and equipment, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization,
              or
              capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

Revenues,
              interest income and interest expense, income before income taxes, and
              identifiable assets for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented

              Stock Compensation Plans

The
              various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below:

              Equity Incentive Plan

In
              June,
              2005, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the Plan)
              providing for
              grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and “other” stock
              compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
              pursuant
              to which up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock were available for
              issuance. The
              stock options generally vest over a period of five years or as otherwise
              determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee
              and generally
              expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised. Option activity
              under
              the Plan during 2005 is summarized below. In 2005 the Company granted
              836,000
              stock appreciation rights.

              Equity Incentive Plan

In
              October 2000, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the
              Plan)
              providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
“other”
stock compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
              pursuant to which up to 3,500,000 shares of common stock were available
              for
              issuance. The stock options generally vest over a period of five years
              or as
              otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation
              Committee and
              generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
              Option
              activity under the Plan during 2005, 2004 and 2003 is summarized below.
              There
              have been no “other” stock compensation awards granted under the
              Plan.

              Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

Also
              in
              October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
              directors (the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for
              up to 50,000
              common shares of the Company’s stock. The term of each award is ten years. All
              awards vest evenly over a three-year period. During 2005, 2004, and
              2003,
              options to purchase 5,500, 6,621, and 3,648 shares were granted under
              this plan.

              information regarding net income and earnings per share is required

SFAS
              No.
              123 requires the pro forma information be determined as if the Company
              has
              accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method
              of that
              statement. As described below, the fair value accounting provided under

              for use
              in valuing employee stock options. The fair value for these options
              was
              estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
              model with
              the following weighted-average assumptions for 2005, 2004, and 2003:
              risk-free
              interest rate of 4.10%, 3.80%, and 4.25% , respectively; dividend yields
              of
              0.98%, 1.3% and 1.0% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; volatility
              factor of
              the expected market price of the Company’s common stock of 0.3224, 0.3577, and
              0.3927, respectively; and a weighted-average expected life of the option
              of six
              years in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.


The
              Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
              the
              fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and
              are fully
              transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input
              of highly
              subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
              Because
              the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly
              different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
              subjective
              input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
              management’s
              opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
              single
              measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Employee
              Stock Purchase Plan

The
              stockholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up
              to
              1,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares
              will be
              offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
              market
              value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market
              value on
              the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock
              purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2005,
              2004, and 2003, 56,399, 58,950, and 70,857 shares were purchased under
              the plan
              for a total purchase price of $2,824, $2,691, and $1,805, respectively.
              At
              December 31, 2005, approximately 621,000 shares were available for
              future
              issuance.

              $54.54 per
              share were outstanding during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, but
              were not
              included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
              options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
              shares
              and, therefore, the effect was antidilutive.

              Share Repurchase Program

On
              April
              21, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase
              up to
              3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock through April 30, 2006. As of
              December 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased 738,000 shares using
              cash of
              $29,835.

12.
              Shareholder Rights Plan

On
              October 24, 2001, Garmin’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
              (the “Rights Plan”). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend
              of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share
              of Garmin
              to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2001. The rights trade
              together with
              Garmin’s common shares. The rights generally will become exercisable if a
              person
              or group acquires or announces an intention to acquire 15% or more
              of Garmin’s
              outstanding common shares. Each right (other than those held by the
              new 15%
              shareholder) will then be exercisable to purchase preferred shares
              of Garmin (or
              in certain instances other securities of Garmin) having at that time
              a market
              value equal to two times the then current exercise price. Garmin’s Board of
              Directors may redeem the rights at $0.002 per right at any time before
              the
              rights become exercisable. The rights expire on October 31, 2011.

              Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited)

The
                above
                quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management,
                all
                adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data
                for these
                interim periods presented have been included. These results are not
                necessarily
                indicative of future quarterly results.

                Garmin AT Acquisition

On
                August
                22, 2003, GII acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of UPS
                Aviation
                Technologies, Inc. for $38 million in cash. UPS Aviation Technologies,
                headquartered in Salem, Oregon, designs and manufactures multiple
                lines of
                communications, navigation and surveillance products for general
                aviation and
                air transport customers.


The
                purchase price of the UPS Aviation Technologies acquisition was allocated
                to the
                estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
                based on
                management’s estimates and third-party appraisals. The excess purchase price
                over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to deductible
                goodwill in the amount of $11.4 million. UPS Aviation Technologies,
                Inc. was
                subsequently renamed Garmin AT, Inc. by the Company. The results
                of Garmin AT,
                Inc. are included in the financial statements for the periods subsequent
                to
                August 22, 2003.

The
                following table summarizes the purchase price allocation and the
                useful life of
                intangibles for the aforementioned acquisition:

                  year ended
                  December 27, 2003 as though the business had been acquired as of
                  the beginning
                  of the period presented, after including the estimated impact of
                  certain
                  adjustments such as amortization of intangibles:

The
                  pro

                  occurred if the
                  acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented. In addition,
                  they are
                  not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect
                  any
                  synergies that might be achieved from combining the operations.

                  Warranty Reserves

The
                  Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods
                  ranging
                  from one to two years. The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
                  obligations are based on historical experience and expectation
                  of future
                  conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
                  The following
                  reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate
                  warranty

(a)
                    Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
                    and
                    Procedures

Under
                    the
                    supervision and with the participation of our management, including
                    the Chief
                    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated
                    the
                    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
                    and
                    procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) as of the
                    end of the period
                    covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive
                    Officer and
                    Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure
                    controls and
                    procedures are effective.

(b)
                    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
                    Reporting

Management
                    of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
                    adequate internal
                    control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial
                    reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
                    regarding the
                    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
                    statements
                    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
                    principles.

Because
                    of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
                    reporting may not
                    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
                    of
                    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
                    controls may become
                    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
                    of compliance
                    with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
                    of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
                    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment,
                    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
                    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated
                    Framework”.

Based
                    on
                    such assessment and those criteria, management believes that
                    the Company
                    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
                    as of December
                    31, 2005.

Ernst
                    & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
                    that audited
                    the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report
                    on
                    management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
                    reporting. That attestation report appears below.

                    of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
                    Ltd.

We
                    have
                    audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
                    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Garmin
                    Ltd. and
                    Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial
                    reporting as
                    of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
                    Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
                    of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd. and
                    Subsidiaries’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
                    control over
                    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
                    of internal
                    control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
                    an opinion on
                    management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
                    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
                    conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
                    Company
                    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
                    that we plan
                    and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
                    effective
                    internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
                    material
                    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
                    control over
                    financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
                    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
                    performing such
                    other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
                    We believe
                    that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
                    company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
                    to
                    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
                    reporting
                    and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
                    in accordance
                    with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
                    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
                    (1) pertain to
                    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
                    and fairly
                    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
                    company; (2)
                    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
                    necessary to
                    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
                    generally accepted
                    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
                    the company are
                    being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
                    and directors of
                    the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
                    or timely
                    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
                    the company’s
                    assets that could have a material effect on the financial
                    statements.

Because
                    of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
                    reporting may not
                    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
                    of
                    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
                    controls may become
                    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
                    of compliance
                    with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
                    our
                    opinion, management’s assessment that Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained
                    effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
                    31, 2005, is
                    fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
                    Also, in
                    our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all
                    material respects,
                    effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
                    31, 2005,
                    based on
