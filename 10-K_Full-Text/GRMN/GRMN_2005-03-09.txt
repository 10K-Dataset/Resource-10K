Recent Developments in
the Company’s Business

Since
the inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 10 million products. This
benchmark was achieved during 2004 with the delivery of over 2.3 million units.


New Consumer Product
Introductions

Among
the new consumer products launched in 2004 was the Garmin Marine Network, a proprietary
ethernet-based network that seamlessly connects several plug-and-play marine components,
delivering position data, charting, weather, sonar, radar and other data to boaters.

In
March 2004, Garmin began shipping the StreetPilot® 2620, for portable automotive
applications. This newest addition to our StreetPilot® product line features fully
loaded maps, eliminating the need for downloading map data to the unit from a computer.

New Aviation Product
Introductions

Among
the new Garmin aviation products in 2004 was the G1000 integrated avionics system which
began shipping in late 2004. The G1000 system is currently certified by the Federal
Aviation Administration in seven aircraft models.

Expansion of Facilities

marked the completion by Garmin International, Inc., Garmin’s principal U.S.
subsidiary, of a $65 million expansion of its Olathe, Kansas facility, which supports the
Company’s engineering, product development, warehouse, and customer support
operations. Garmin AT, Inc., another U.S. subsidiary, also completed an expansion of its
Salem, Oregon aircraft hangar facility, which provides additional capacity to support
certification of aviation products. Garmin’s Taiwan subsidiary also improved its
manufacturing capability in 2004 by adding additional Surface Mount Technology (SMT)
manufacturing lines and adding 300 new manufacturing associates at its Taiwan factory.

Company Overview

Garmin
is a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices,
most of which are enabled by GPS technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and
markets a diverse family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and
other navigation, communications and information products for the general aviation and
consumer markets. Each of Garmin’s GPS products utilizes its proprietary integrated
circuit and receiver designs to collect, calculate and display location, direction, speed
and other information in forms optimized for specific uses.

Overview of the Global
Positioning System

The
Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise
determination of geographic location using established satellite technology. The system
consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground
control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States
Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to
ensure continuous global system coverage. Access to the system is provided free of charge
by the U.S. government.

Reception
of GPS signals from the satellites requires line-of-sight visibility between the
satellites and the receiver. GPS receivers can be very compact, and it is not necessary to
have a large dish antenna to receive GPS signals.

Prior
to May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of
civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (“SA”) for
national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a radius of 100
meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense discontinued SA. In a presidential
policy statement issued in December 2004, the Bush administration stated that the U.S.
does not intend to implement SA again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS
through regional denial of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA
removed, a GPS receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10
meters or less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.


The
accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced even further through augmentation techniques
which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a GPS
device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a Wide Area
Augmentation System (“WAAS”) comprising ground reference stations and additional
satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States and
portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as
the primary means of enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the United
States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled
GPS receivers for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS
system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for
instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment. Since that time,
the FAA has installed four new ground reference stations in Alaska with the plan that they
will be fully operational in December 2005. Further planned improvements to the WAAS
system include the addition of two new geostationary satellites transmitting WAAS
corrections and integrity and additional ground reference stations in Canada and Mexico
that are scheduled for integration into the operational WAAS system in 2006.

Products

Garmin
has achieved a leading market position and a history of consistent growth in revenues and
profits by offering ergonomically designed, user friendly products with innovative
features and designs covering a broad range of applications and price points.

Garmin’s
target markets currently consist of the consumer segment, which primarily includes marine,
recreational, fitness, PDA and automotive products, and the aviation segment, which
consists of panel mount and portable products for use in general aviation aircraft.

While
the marine, recreational, automotive and aviation product lines will continue to be the
core of Garmin’s business in the near-term, GPS capabilities are becoming
increasingly commercially viable in a wide range of consumer products and services,
two-way radios, and mobile information devices (such as Family Radio Service and General
Mobile Radio Service, two-way radios, and personal digital assistants). Garmin’s goal
is to take advantage of its brand name and its product development experience to expand
its product line in these markets.

Consumer

Garmin
currently offers a wide range of consumer products, including handheld GPS receivers,
two-way radios with integrated GPS receivers, GPS-enabled portable digital assistants,
GPS-enabled training assistants for athletic activities, portable automotive navigation
devices and fixed-mount GPS/Sounder products. Garmin believes that its consumer products
are known for their value, high performance, innovation and ergonomics.

Garmin
also offers a broad set of accessories for its products. For instance, Garmin’s
MapSource

®

CDs, which can be loaded into selected GPS products through a
personal computer, provide detailed mapping information for the United States and Canada,
Australia, South Africa and a number of European, Middle East and Asian countries. With
this information, many of Garmin’s products can provide the customer with detailed
information concerning business listings and points of interest. A user can choose a
business listing (e.g., restaurants, hotels, and shops) and the unit will display the
location of the destination on a map along with the user’s location and the distance
from the user’s location. Some of Garmin’s products offer automatic route
calculation and turn-by-turn route guidance. Garmin’s BlueChart

®

CD’s and data cards, which are compatible with selected GPS chartplotter and handheld
products, provide detailed nautical chart data for boaters.

Flying

Magazine as the Editor’s Choice Product of the Year for 1998. In 1994, and again in
2000, Garmin earned recognition from the Aircraft Electronics Association for outstanding
contribution to the general aviation electronics industry. The GPSMAP 295 won

Aviation
Consumer

Magazine’s Gear of the Year award for best aviation portable
product in 2000 and again in 2001. Garmin won first place for avionics product support in

Professional Pilot

magazine’s survey of its readers published in its January
2005 issue. Also, Garmin was ranked No. 1 among avionics manufacturers for operation,
presentation, technical advancement, information, construction and satisfaction in a
survey of readers of

Professional Pilot

magazine published in its January 2004
issue. Garmin received the Airline Technology Achievement Award from

Air Transport
World Magazine

in January 2005 for championing the development of Automatic Dependent
Surveillance Broadcast technology, an enabling technology for air traffic management.


Garmin’s
panel-mounted aviation products are sold in the retrofit market where older aircraft are
fitted with the latest electronics from Garmin’s broad product line. Garmin believes
this market continues to have good growth potential as aircraft owners elect to upgrade
their existing aircraft at a cost that is lower than purchasing a new aircraft.

Garmin
has also expanded its range of aviation electronics (avionics) offerings to leading
General Aviation aircraft manufacturers such as the Cessna Aircraft Company, Diamond
Aircraft Industries and Mooney Aircraft Corporation through the OEM installation of the
G1000 integrated cockpit system. This system integrates attitude, heading, air data,
navigation, communication, engine monitoring, and other aircraft functions into a single
cohesive system which interfaces with the flight crew using a set of large
sunlight-readable TFT displays. Garmin anticipates further growth in its sales to the
original equipment manufacturers market as its product offerings expand to include flight

Research and Development

Garmin’s
product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the
close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams. Garmin’s
products are created by its engineering and design staff, which numbered 567 people
worldwide as of December 31, 2004. Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes
manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to
ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s
design staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical
engineers and mechanical engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products
has played an important role in Garmin’s success. Once a development project is
initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and
transition it into manufacturing.


Below
is a table of Garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three
fiscal years.

Manufacturing and
Operations

Garmin
believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its Shijr,
Taiwan facility, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility. Garmin
believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits:

Reduced
time-to-market.

Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s
products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback
provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its
design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and yields. Reducing
time to market has enabled Garmin to offer several industry firsts, such as the Rino
GPS-enabled Family Radio Service/General Mobile Radio Service two-way radio, the iQue 3600
portable digital assistant with integrated GPS and mapping, and the GNS 430, which
integrates traditional aviation navigation and communications systems with GPS in a single
package.

Design
and process optimization.

Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to
rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve higher
efficiency, lower cost and better value for customers. Garmin’s ability to fully
explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its
designs to minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and
rugged.

Logistical
agility.

Operating its own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize
problems, such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in
the electronics industry. Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages
or reduce cost and the new designs can quickly fill the distribution pipeline. Garmin
reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by maintaining a safety stock of long-lead
components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.

Garmin’s
design and manufacturing processes are certified to ISO 9001-2000, international quality
standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s
Taiwan manufacturing facility has also achieved QS 9000 quality certification, a quality
standard for automotive suppliers. In addition, Garmin’s aviation panel-mount
products are designed and manufactured according to processes which are approved and
monitored by the FAA.

Materials

Garmin
purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the world. For
certain components, Garmin relies on sole source suppliers. The failure of our suppliers
to deliver components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely
affect our business. We experienced component shortages in the first half of 2004 that
adversely affected our ability to fulfill customer orders for certain of our new products.
These component availability issues generally abated by the end of the year.

Seasonality

Our
sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products
are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer
marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday
buying season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release
of new products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are
more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is
typically the strongest.


Backlog

Our
sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between
order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the
understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our
success and ability to compete is dependent in part on its proprietary technology. We rely
on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As of March
1, 2005, we held 208 U.S. patents that expire at various dates no earlier than 2006. As of
March 1, 2005, Garmin had 168 U.S. patent applications pending. Garmin also holds two
foreign patents. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for
use in its business. For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography
technology for use in our products from various sources. Our registered U.S. trademarks
include: GARMIN; the GARMIN logo; the GARMIN globe design; the GARMIN “swoosh”
design; APOLLO; BLUECHART; CITY SELECT; DCG; ETREX; ETREX CAMO; ETREX LEGEND; ETREX
SUMMIT; ETREX VISTA; ETREX VENTURE; FORERUNNER, GNC; GPS II; GPS III; GPS V; GPSMAP;
GUIDANCE BY GARMIN; IQUE; MAPSOURCE; METROGUIDE; NAVTALK; PERSONAL NAVIGATOR; RINO;
SEE-THRU; STREETPILOT and TRACBACK. Our mark GARMIN and certain other trademarks have also
been registered in selected foreign countries. Garmin’s trademarks include FORETREX;
G1000; GEKO; NROUTE, QUE, QUEST and WAAS ENABLED. Some of Garmin’s patents and its
registered trademarks and trademarks are owned by Garmin’s subsidiaries, Garmin
Corporation, Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin AT, Inc.

We
believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and
their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent
applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in its
proprietary technologies.

There
is no assurance that Garmin’s current patents, or patents which it may later acquire,
may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that
any patent issued to Garmin may not provide it with any competitive advantages, or that
the patents of others will preclude Garmin from manufacturing and marketing certain
products. Despite Garmin’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized
parties may attempt to copy aspects of Garmin’s products or to obtain and use
information that Garmin regards as proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future
to enforce Garmin’s intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets, to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against
claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

Garmin’s
aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated
aircraft” are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the
European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be
used in an aircraft. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the
regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with
Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless
transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the FCC and
comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products
sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
A delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to
Garmin’s products or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could
adversely affect our business.


Because
Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in
Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to
remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations. The
Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provide that all
foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business
by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of China, also referred to as
the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be
retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of
merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange
banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and
residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign
currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each
calendar year. Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated
banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to
remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other
foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if
a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons
justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to
register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.

Environmental Matters

Capital
expenditures, earnings and the competitive position of Garmin have not been materially
affected by compliance with United States federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations.

The
European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“RoHS
Directive”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE
Directive”). The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws prohibiting
the use of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, in certain
electronic products put on the market after July 1, 2006. The WEEE Directive requires EU
member states to enact laws that come into effect by August 13, 2005 regulating the
collection, recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products. We will need
to ensure that we timely comply with such laws and regulations. In order to comply with
the RoHS Directive, we will need to modify the design of certain of our products and/or
use different components in such products. We could incur substantial costs in connection
with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations. We could also be subject
to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we were to fail to deliver
products that comply with these laws, which could cause our financial condition or
operating results to suffer.

Employees

As
of December 31, 2004, Garmin had 2,484 full-time employees worldwide, of whom 1,111 were
in the United States, 1,311 were in Taiwan and 62 were in the United Kingdom. None of
Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.

Item 2.  Properties

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in
our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the
periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other
related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial
statements (including the notes thereto and the report of independent auditors thereon),
the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk
factors discussed below (the “Company-Specific Trends and Risks”).

As
previously noted, the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form
10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events. Readers can identify these
forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects”,
“anticipates”, “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such
verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove incorrect or
should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from
those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a
number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed
below in the section titled “Company-Specific Trends and Risks.” Readers are
strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking
statement. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

The
Company’s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the
calendar year. Fiscal year 2000 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for fiscal years
2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the
Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references in this document to “we,” “us,” “our” and similar
terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless
otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per
share data.

Overview

We
are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices,
most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology. We operate in
two business segments, the consumer and aviation markets. Both of our segments offer
products through our network of independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature
of products and types of customers for the two segments vary significantly. As such, the
segments are managed separately. Our consumer segment includes portable GPS receivers and
accessories for marine, recreation, land and automotive applications sold primarily to
retail outlets. Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual
Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail
outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.

Since
our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from
operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits. Our sales have
increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 22% since 2000 and our net income has
increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% since 2000. The vast majority of this
growth has been organic; only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of
the acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies in 2003, and this acquisition had no
significant impact on net income for that year.

Since
our principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience some
foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results. The functional currency of our
European operations is the U.S. dollar (effective in 2001) and the functional currency of
our Asian operations is the New Taiwan Dollar. Less than 25 percent of transactions of our
European operations are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro. We
experienced $(24.8) million, $(6.7) million, $0.0 million, $11.6 million, and $7.0 million
in foreign currency gains (losses) during fiscal years 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions with the European
Dollar, the British Pound Sterling or the New Taiwan Dollar, although we may utilize
hedging transactions in the future.


Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

General

The
Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The presentation of these financial statements requires the Company to make
estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going
basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales
programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible
assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. The Company
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

The
Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and
incentive offerings including rebates, price protection, promotions and other volume-based
incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgements using
historical experience and expectation of future conditions. Changes in these estimates
could negatively affect the Company’s operating results. These incentives are accrued
for on a percentage of sales basis and reviewed periodically. If market conditions were to
decline, the Company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly
resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.

Warranties

The
Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from
one to two years. The Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide
warranty services. The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the
extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs
associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in
decreased gross profit.

Inventory

The
Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory
equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs
may be required.

Investments

Investments
are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment
gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity. Investment income is recorded
when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.
Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of
value that is considered other than temporary. If investments are determined to be
impaired, a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination.


Testing
for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement. The
identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value
and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key
judgement elements. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can
significantly change these judgements. Revisions of impairment judgements are made when
new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that
time. The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the
difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.

Income Taxes

The
Company provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting
purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. While no valuation allowance has been recorded, it is
the Company’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax
assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. While the
Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company
were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax
assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income
in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it
would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net
recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the
period such determination was made.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in
the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues
in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to
be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our
estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further
charge to expense would result.

Stock Based Compensation

The
Company distributes a relatively small number of stock options each year as part of the
Company’s compensation package for employees. Employees with certain levels of
responsibility within the Company are eligible for stock option grants, but the granting
of options is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
and is not a contractual obligation. Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Terms and
Characteristics

Net Sales

Our
net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor
network and to original equipment manufacturers. We recognize sales when products are
shipped. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore backlog levels are not
necessarily indicative of our future sales results. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround
on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net
sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products
are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer
marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday
buying season. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are
more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is
typically the strongest.


Gross Profit

Raw
material costs are our most significant cost item. We did not experience significant
pricing pressure on high technology components in fiscal 2001 and 2002. We experienced
upward pricing pressures on our high technology components in late 2003, but offset much
of those with efficiencies in our manufacturing processes. We experienced shortages in
certain high technology components in early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on
components in the first half of 2004, much of which was alleviated by the end of the
fiscal year. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our
products in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from
different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit us to use
these lower cost components. We believe that because of our practice of performing the
design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house, our Shijr, Taiwan, Olathe,
Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of
manufacturing, compared to our competition. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan
have been our highest volume products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have
been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales
price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. In
the past, prices of some of our devices sold into the consumer market have declined due to
market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points. The average
selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the
introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales
price variability inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a
significant impact on our gross profit.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

•   salaries for sales and marketing personnel;

•   salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

•   advertising, marketing, and other brand building costs;

•   accounting and legal costs;

•   information systems and infrastructure costs;

•   travel and related costs; and

•   occupancy and other overhead costs.

With
the expected increase of total revenues in the future, we expect selling, general and
administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. We intend to
increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to build increased brand awareness in
the consumer marketplace, especially as we continue to develop new markets, such as
automotive and personal digital assistants (PDA). We also intend to increase our customer
call center support as our consumer segment continues to grow. Another cause of increased
selling, general, and administrative costs was the continued implementation of an ORACLE
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system during fiscal 2004 and associated information
system staffing needed to support ORACLE.

Research and Development

The
majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs
for high technology components used in product and prototype development, and costs of
test equipment needed during product development. Substantially all of the research and
development of our products is performed in the United States.

We
are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products
as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as
well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices. We continue to grow our research and
development budget on absolute terms. Research and development expenses may also grow at a
faster rate when compared to our projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2005.


Customers

No
customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in the year ended December 25, 2004.
Our top ten customers have contributed between 25% and 30% of net sales since 2001. We
have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable between 35 and 53
days since 2001. The average sales days in our customer accounts receivable was 53 days as
of December 25, 2004. We have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts
receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms, and anticipate
maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward.

Income Taxes

We
have experienced a relatively low effective tax rate in Taiwan due to lower marginal tax
rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain
high-technology capital investments. Therefore, profits earned in Taiwan have been taxed
at a lower rate than those in the United States and Europe. As a result, our consolidated
effective tax rate was approximately 19.4 percent during 2004. We have taken advantage of
this tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from
lower effective tax rates at least through 2009. The current Taiwan tax incentives for
which Garmin has received approval will end in 2009. We plan on applying for additional
incentives for years beyond 2009 based on capital investments we expect to make in the
future. However, there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available
indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply.

Results of Operations

The
following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during
the periods shown:


The
following table sets forth our results of operations for each of our two segments through
income before taxes during the period shown. For each line item in the table the total of
the consumer and aviation segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated
statements of income data included in Item 6.

The
increase in total net sales during fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the introduction of 50
new products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation products. Total consumer and
aviation units sold increased 12.0% to 2,306,000 in 2004 from 2,066,000 in 2003. In
general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new
products are essential for future revenue growth.

The
Company’s revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth quarter
revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters. In 2004, however,
revenues increased each consecutive quarter due to the impact of new product releases
across all product lines. The revenue increase in third quarter was primarily attributable
to initial G1000 cockpit sales, the onset of the marine selling season and Father’s
Day purchases. The increase in revenues in the third quarter was due to new product
releases and delivery of backorders placed during the second quarter. The revenue increase
in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to new product releases and sales
associated with the traditional holiday selling season. Revenues can also be impacted in
any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions.

The
increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of 35 new
consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total units sold were up
12%. It is management’s belief that the continued demand for the Company’s
consumer products is due to the emergence of the GPS market in general, and overall
increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of GPS.


The
increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased sales from panel
mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and retrofit markets
and sales from Garmin AT, Inc., which was acquired during the third quarter of 2003. While
Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR’s) continue to impact general aviation, the flying
community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers.
Should the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) impose more restrictions, or elect to
shutdown U.S. airspace in the future, these factors could have a material adverse effect
on our business.

The
increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of 35 new
products and overall demand for our consumer products. The reduction in gross margin
percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older products in advance of new product
releases, a change in product mix towards certain lower gross margin product lines and
increases in certain raw material costs early in the fiscal year. Upward pricing pressure
on certain raw materials components in early 2004 generally abated by the end of the year.

The
decrease in consumer gross margin was attributable to higher component costs early in the
year, higher than normal price reductions on older products in advance of the release of
35 new products during the year, and a shift in product mix, as automotive products became
a larger portion of revenue for our consumer products segment.

The
decrease in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our
OEM and retrofit products as the G1000 product line began selling into new aircraft.

The
increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across
the organization (net increase of over 400 non-engineering employees), significantly
increased advertising costs (up 33%) associated primarily with consumer products, ORACLE
software implementation costs, and additional staffing in our customer call center. In the
past, selling, general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues
due to strong demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products. Management
expects that in spite of strong demand for our products, selling, general and
administrative expenses will remain flat or increase slightly as a percentage of sales
during fiscal 2005 due to higher depreciation costs associated with the expanded
facilities in Olathe, Kansas.

The
increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of
52 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2004 and the Garmin AT
engineering team contributing for the full fiscal year. Management believes that one of
the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the Company is continuous
innovation, development, and introduction of new products. Management expects that its
research and development expenses will increase approximately 20% to 25% during fiscal
2005 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of approximately 60
new products for fiscal 2005. Management expects to continue to invest in the research and
development of new products and technology in order to maintain the Company’s
competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes.

Other Income (Expense)

Other
income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense and foreign
currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was significantly lower in
fiscal 2004, relative to fiscal year 2003, with the majority of this difference caused by
foreign currency losses in 2004. Interest income for fiscal 2004 increased due to larger
cash and marketable securities balances during the year, increasing the returns on the
Company’s cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2004, due
primarily to the retirement of $20 million of outstanding long-term debt during fiscal
2003.

During
fiscal 2004 the Company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of $24.8 million, as
the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New Taiwan Dollar (32.19 NTD/USD) relative to the end
of fiscal 2003 (34.05 NTD/USD). During fiscal 2003 the Company experienced foreign
currency exchange losses of $6.7 million, as the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New
Taiwan Dollar (34.05 NTD/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2002 (35.10 NTD/USD).

Income Tax Provision

Income
tax expense increased by $2.2 million, to $49.5 million, for fiscal year 2004 from $47.3
million for fiscal year 2003 due to our higher taxable income. The effective tax rate was
19.4% for fiscal 2004 versus 20.9% for fiscal 2003. The decrease in tax rate is due to
additional tax benefits received from Taiwan as a result of our continued capital
investment in our manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, and the increased contribution to
our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2004 relative to 2003. Management believes
that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 will be comparable to fiscal 2004. The actual
effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume, additional capital
investments made during fiscal 2005, and composition of our earnings.


Net Inco

me

As
a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 15.2% to $205.7 million
for fiscal year 2004 compared to $178.6 million for fiscal year 2003.

The
increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the introduction of 16 new products
and overall demand for our consumer products. The improvement in gross margin was
primarily due to the introduction of new higher margin products, improved manufacturing
efficiencies on many of the new products introduced throughout the year, and reductions of
certain material costs early in the fiscal year. The Company experienced upward pricing
pressure on certain raw materials components in the latter part of 2003.

The
increase in consumer gross margin was primarily attributable to the introduction of 16 new

The
increase in aviation gross profit was primarily due to improved product mix within our OEM
and retrofit products partially offset by certain lower gross profit margin products as a
result of the acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies.

The
increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of
50 UPS Aviation Technologies engineering associates to our aviation research and
development team and the addition of 100 new engineers to our research and development
teams during fiscal 2003. Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives
for future growth and success of the Company is continuous innovation, development, and
introduction of new products.

Other Income (Expens

e)

Other
income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense and foreign
currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was significantly lower in
fiscal 2003, relative to fiscal year 2002, with the majority of this difference caused by
foreign currency losses in 2003. Interest income for fiscal 2003 increased due to larger
cash and marketable securities balances during the year, increasing the returns on the
Company’s cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased for fiscal 2003
relative to fiscal 2002, due primarily to the retirement of $20 million of outstanding
long-term debt during fiscal 2003.

During
fiscal 2003 the Company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of $6.7 million, as
the U.S. Dollar weakened versus the New Taiwan Dollar (34.05 NTD/USD) relative to the end
of fiscal 2002 (34.90 NTD/USD). During fiscal 2002 the Company’s position was neutral
with regard to foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and the U.S. Dollar was at
approximately the same level at the beginning of 2002 relative to the New Taiwan Dollar
(35.17 NTD/USD) as it was at the end of fiscal 2002 (34.90 NTD/USD).


Income Tax Provision

Income
tax expense increased by $7.4 million, to $47.3 million, for fiscal year 2003 from $39.9
million for fiscal year 2002 due to our higher taxable income. The effective tax rate was
20.9% for fiscal 2003 versus 21.9% for fiscal 2002. The decrease in tax rate was due
primarily to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan as a result of our continued
capital investment in our manufacturing facilities there.

Net Income

As
a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 25.1% to $178.6 million
for fiscal year 2003 compared to $142.8 million for fiscal year 2002.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Net
cash generated by operations was $208.9 millon, $173.5 million, and $161.9 million for
fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We operate with a customer-oriented
approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Because we
desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time, our
inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand. We also attempt to
carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages
have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products. We
significantly increased our raw material and finished goods inventories in 2004 in
anticipation of new product releases in the first half of 2005. In addition, we prefer to
have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products.
Finished goods inventory levels also continued to grow as a function of our growing sales.
We expect that raw materials inventory levels may decrease during fiscal 2005 as lead
times for key components decrease.

Capital
expenditures in 2004 totaled $78.1 million, an increase of $45.3 million over fiscal 2003.
This increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to expansion of our Olathe, Kansas
facility ($47 million) and maintenance capital expenditures ($31 million). During fiscal
2003, our capital expenditures totaled $32.8 million. The expenditures in fiscal 2003 were
primarily related to the initiation of expansion of our Olathe, Kansas facility ($17
million) and maintenance capital expenditures ($15.8 million).

We
have budgeted approximately $25 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 to
include normal ongoing capital expenditures and purchases of production machinery and
equipment to expand capacity in the Shijr, Taiwan facility.

In
addition to capital expenditures, in 2004 cash flow used in investing related to the
purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our on-hand cash
balances and approximately $1.8 million of intangible assets. The Company’s average
return on its investments during fiscal 2004 was approximately 1.7%. In addition to
capital expenditures, in 2003 cash flow used in investing relates to the $38.2 million
acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies (renamed Garmin AT), the purchase of fixed income
securities associated with the investment of our on-hand cash balances and approximately
$0.6 million of intangible assets. It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash
consistent with the Company’s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board
of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital,
maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of
maximum safety. The Company’s average return on its investments during fiscal year
2003 was approximately 1.5%.


Cash
flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2004 of $51.1
million. During 2004, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares of its common shares under
the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors
on April 21, 2004 and expires on April 30, 2006. Sources and uses in financing activities
during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend ($54.1 million) and
stock repurchase ($3.1 million), and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock
related to the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan
($6.1 million). Cash flow used in financing activities during 2003 related primarily to
the payment of a dividend ($54.0 million), and reduction of our debt ($20.0 million). The
Company retired approximately $20.0 million of long-term debt during fiscal 2003, which
represented the remainder of an outstanding issue of industrial revenue bonds. The
employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases generated a
$4.3 million source of cash in 2003. Cash flow used in financing activities during 2002
relates primarily to the reduction of our debt. The Company retired approximately $12.2
million of its long-term debt during fiscal 2002, consisting in good part of an
outstanding issue of industrial revenue bonds. The employee stock purchase plan and stock
option exercises were a $2.1 million source of cash in 2002.

We
currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and to support
our working capital requirements. We expect that future cash requirements will principally
be for capital expenditures and working capital requirements.

Cash
dividends paid to shareholders were $54.1 million, $54.0 million, and $0.0 million during
fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

We
believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient
to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at
least through the end of fiscal 2005.

Company-Specific Trends
and Risks

You
should carefully consider the risks described below regarding an investment in our common
shares. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be
immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur,
our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

Risks Related to the
Company

Our Global Positioning System
products depend upon satellites maintained by the United States Department of Defense. If
a significant number of these satellites become inoperable, unavailable or are not
replaced or if the policies of the United States government for the use of the Global
Positioning System without charge are changed or if there is interference with Global
Positioning System signals, our business will suffer.

The
Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system
consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground
control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States
Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for
access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems are
complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible
sabotage. The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are
subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. However, of the
current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 13
years.

If
a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not
replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning System products
and would have a material negative effect on our business. In addition, there can be no
assurance that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance
of Global Positioning System satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the
U.S. government that provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge
and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing
commercial applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies
may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of Global
Positioning System signals. However, in a presidential policy statement issued in December
2004, the Bush administration stated that the U.S. is committed to supporting and
improving the Global Positioning System and will continue providing it free from direct
user fees.

Some
of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area
Augmentation System (WAAS). WAAS is operated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Any
curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could result in decreased user capability
for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets.

Any
of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select
Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing
technologies.


A shut down of U.S.
airspace would harm our business.

On
September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft operated by
commercial air carriers, resulting in major loss of life and property. Following the
terrorist attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) ordered all
aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days. In addition to this shut
down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the
additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual
Flight Rules (VFR). The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile
radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas. The Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected
approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30
enhanced Class B airspace areas. The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general
aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are
current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

The
shut down of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our
general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our
Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby
adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and
distributors.

Any
future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Any reallocation of radio
frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of Global Positioning
System signals. This interference could harm our business.

Our
Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning
Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning System satellites.
The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally
allocated for radio navigation satellite services. The assignment of spectrum is
controlled by an international organization known as the International Telecommunications
Union (“ITU”). The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) is
responsible for the assignment of spectrum for non-government use in the United States in
accordance with ITU regulations. Any ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum,
including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference
with the reception of Global Positioning System signals and may materially and adversely
affect the utility and reliability of our products, which would, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, emissions from mobile satellite
service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially
and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products, which could result in a
material adverse effect on our operating results. The FCC continually receives proposals
for new technologies and services, such as ultra-wideband technologies, which may seek to
operate in, or across, the radio frequency bands currently used by the GPS SPS. Adverse
decisions by the FCC that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the GPS SPS
may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products, which
could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

If we are not successful in the
continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our
products could decrease.

We
expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from
sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products is characterized by
rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If
we fail to modify or improve our products in response to changes in technology, industry
standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or
obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in
order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market
acceptance for such products. However, there can be no assurance that development stage
products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant
customer acceptance.


If
we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance
our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. Our
pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to
license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be
available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits
that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to
new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology
products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve
timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these
products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
We have previously experienced delays in shipping certain of our products and any future
delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market
acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

If we do not correctly anticipate
demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or
cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or
inventories.

Historically,
we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products (although we did
experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to declining economic
conditions and the shut down of U.S. airspace as a result of the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11, 2001) and we have generally been able to increase production to
meet that demand. However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be
difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as
we introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market for our
products intensifies. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the
following problems in our operations:

•
If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those
suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected
demand.

•
Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher
costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs
could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing
quality could decline, which may also lower our margins.

•
If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher
inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to
write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could
also result in excess manufacturing capacity at our facilities, which could result in
lower margins.

We may become subject to
significant product liability costs.

If
our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or
crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. Malfunctions
or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground
or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could
be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage. We maintain
insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no
assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others
or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. If
we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs, our
business could be harmed.


We depend on our suppliers, some
of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be
seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative
sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.

We
are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current
products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include
semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips and
microprocessors. The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the
successful production and sale of our products. Some components we use are from sole
source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our
proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources
may not be currently available for these sole source components.

In
the past (including in the first half of 2004) we have experienced shortages of liquid
crystal displays and other components. In addition, if there are shortages in supply of
components, the costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our
demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative
source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of
components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our
products would be seriously harmed.

We
license mapping data for use in our products from various sources. There are only a
limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. If we are unable
to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or
if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to supply mapping data
for use in our products would be seriously harmed.

We rely on independent dealers and
distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our
business.

Because
we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject
to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our
products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our
products in their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels
of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our
sales could be negatively impacted.

Many
of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our
competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and
distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not
be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If
we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to
expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.

Failure to manage our growth and
expansion effectively could adversely impact our business.

Our
ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly
evolving market requires an effective planning and management process. We continue to
increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our
shipments and headcount substantially. This growth has placed, and our anticipated growth
in future operations will continue to place, a significant strain on our management
systems and resources.

Our business may suffer if we are
not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key
personnel.

Our
future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive,
engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. We currently do
not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. We do not have key
man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to
obtain such insurance. The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or
other key employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled
personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult. For example, in
some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers
and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and
therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire
and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.


Our sales and gross margins for
our products may fluctuate or erode.

Our
sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate from period to period due to a
number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the
average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s
life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield
improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and
on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold
at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able
to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new
products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product
introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market
acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected. As we introduce new product lines that serve personal
digital assistant (“PDA”), and original equipment manufacturer automotive and
sensor board applications, we may experience a decline in our overall gross margins from
sales of these potentially high volume but low margin product lines.

Our quarterly operating results
are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our
operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may
fluctuate significantly. If this occurs, the price of our stock would likely decline. As
we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our sales, marketing and
research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales. If revenues
decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be
negatively affected.

Historically,
our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year
and have, from time to time, been lower than the preceding quarter. Our devices are highly
consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters. Sales of
certain of our consumer products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due
to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine and
fishing season. Sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our
fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices
during the holiday season. In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases
to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal
quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Our quarterly financial statements
will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

Our
Taiwan subsidiary holds, and is expected to continue to hold, significant cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities and receivables denominated in U.S. Dollars.
Because the U.S. Dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to
substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for
the U.S. Dollar and the New Taiwan Dollar on these assets, management expects that the
Taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in U.S. Dollar or
U.S. Dollar denominated instruments. Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the
end of each accounting period to translate into New Taiwan dollars all such U.S. Dollar
denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary. This translation is required because the
New Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. This U.S. GAAP-mandated
translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the New
Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies. Such gain or loss will create variations
in our earnings per share. Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange
rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company’s operating
performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.


If we are unable to compete
effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position
could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of
market share.

The
markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in
the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to
new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced
margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or
future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our intellectual property rights
are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon
other’s rights or are infringed upon by others.

We
rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,
confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our
proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered
trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new
technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications
will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered
trademarks. Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be
successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of
reasons. Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not
provide us a significant competitive advantage.

Third
parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. Such claims
could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. From time to
time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents. Litigation concerning patents or
other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such
parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable
terms. We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. Such infringement
claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently
cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major
products.

Failure to obtain required
certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.

We
have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to
governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example, Federal
Aviation Administration (“FAA”) certification is required for all of our
aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft. To the
extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires
significant focus and resources. An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining,
such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products
and, therefore, our operating results. In addition, we cannot assure you that our
certified products will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse
effect on our operating results.

We may be materially
affected by the European RoHS and WEEE directives

The
European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“RoHS
Directive”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE
Directive”). The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws prohibiting
the use of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, in certain
electronic products put on the market after July 1, 2006. The WEEE Directive requires EU
member states to enact laws that come into effect by August 13, 2005 regulating the
collection, recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products. We will need
to ensure that we timely comply with such laws and regulations. In order to comply with
the RoHS Directive, we will need to modify the design of certain of our products and/or
use different components in such products. We could incur substantial costs in connection
with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations. We could also be subject
to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we were to fail to deliver
products that comply with these laws, which could cause our financial condition or
operating results to suffer.


Our business is subject to
economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations.

Our
business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We estimate
that approximately 35% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended December 25, 2004
represented products shipped to international destinations. Accordingly, our future
results could be harmed by a variety of international factors, including:

•
changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

• changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic  conditions,

particularly in emerging markets;

• trade
protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•
potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

• difficulty
in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations; and

•
less effective protection of intellectual property.

We may experience unique economic
and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Relations
between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and
other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could
affect our business and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. Our principal
manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our
panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan
has a unique international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of
China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China. The PRC
government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although
significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years
between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military
force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of
independence by Taiwan. Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely
affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our
operations in Taiwan in the future.

There is uncertainty as to our
shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the Cayman
Islands and Taiwan.

We
are a Cayman Islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside
the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be difficult to effect
service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as
to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments
of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear
original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or Taiwan against us predicated upon the
securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


Our shareholders may face
difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman
Islands law.

Our
corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended,
and by the Companies Law (2004 Revision) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under
Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent
in existence in jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more
difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management,
directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation
incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively less
developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike
many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not specifically provide
for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company. This may make
it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a
merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration
if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders
of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under Cayman
Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of
shareholders of the company. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the
information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit
proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.

Subject
to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a
derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands counsel is not aware
of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands
court.

Enforcement of Civil
Liabilities.

Holders
of our common shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us
because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

There
is uncertainty as to whether the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands would recognize or
enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or
be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against us predicated
upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof

We may pursue strategic
acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business
could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate
such transactions.

We
intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in
complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into any
strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional
product or services offerings or additional industry expertise. In August 2003, we
acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc. We currently have no commitments to make any
material investments or acquisitions, or to enter into strategic partnerships. We may not
be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates,
or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete
those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any
future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and
products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business
issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related
to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key
personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. Our management has had
limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our
operations. We may not successfully integrate any operations, personnel or products that
we may acquire in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our
business could be materially harmed.


We have benefited in the past from
Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments
that may not always be available.

Our
effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate, because we have
benefited from lower tax rates since our inception and from incentives offered in Taiwan
related to our high technology investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits could
have a significant effect on our financial results in the future.

Changes in our United States
federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax
consequences to our shareholders.

We
do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a
“foreign personal holding company” or “passive foreign investment
company” for United States federal income tax purposes. We would constitute a foreign
personal holding company in any taxable year if (1) 60% (or 50% in any year following the
year in which we first became a foreign personal holding company) or more of our gross
income were foreign personal holding company income (which is generally income of a
passive nature such as dividends, interest and royalties) (the “income test”)
and (2) more than 50% of the voting power or value of our equity were owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer U.S. holders that are individuals (the “shareholder
test”).

We
do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. However, because the passive
foreign investment company determination is made annually on the basis of facts and
circumstances that may be beyond our control and because the principles for applying the
passive foreign investment company tests are not entirely clear, we cannot assure that we
will not become a passive foreign investment company. If we are a passive foreign
investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States
person could be liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge
upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which
a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a
passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding
years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests described
above. Additional tax considerations would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a
controlled foreign corporation.

If
we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) were classified as a foreign personal
holding company for 2004 or any prior period, then each shareholder that is a United
States person would be required to pay tax on its pro rata share of the undistributed
foreign personal holding income of such foreign personal holding company. The foreign
personal holding company rules have been repealed and should not apply to us after
December 25, 2004.

Risks Relating to Our
Shares

The volatility of our stock price
could adversely affect investment in our common shares.

The
market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
During 2004, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $28.36 to a high
of $61.74. A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate,
perhaps substantially, including:

•  announcements and rumors of developments related to our business or the

industry in which we compete;

•  quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results

•  the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as

flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our  products

•  general conditions in the worldwide  economy,  including  fluctuations  in

interest rates;

•  announcements of technological innovations;

•  new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

•  product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions

•  developments  in  patents  or  other   intellectual   property  rights  and
                litigation;

•  developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; and

•  any significant acts of terrorism against the United States.


In
addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have
often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such
fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares,
and the market price of our common shares may decline.

Our officers and
directors exert substantial influence over us.

As
of March 1, 2005 members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive
officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed
affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially own approximately 40%
of our outstanding common shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine
the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and
acquisitions. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring
or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other
rights of other holders of our common shares.

Prior to 2006, without the
approval of a majority of certain of our shareholders, we may not dispose of our shares of
Garmin Corporation or its assets, even if it would benefit all of our shareholders.

In
connection with the reorganization whereby Garmin became the holding company for Garmin
Corporation, shareholders of Garmin Corporation entered into a shareholders’
agreement whereby each shareholder party to the agreement agreed to take all reasonable
actions required to prevent the disposition by Garmin of any shares of Garmin Corporation
or of substantially all of the assets of Garmin Corporation until after December 31, 2005
except upon approval of a majority in interest of such shareholders who are U.S. citizens
or residents. Certain of our officers and directors own a substantial portion of these
shares.

Provisions in our charter
documents might deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and Cayman Islands
corporate law may impede a takeover, which could decrease the value of our shares.

Our
Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 preferred shares and to
determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting
rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. This could
have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares. We have no present plans
to issue any preferred shares, but we may do so. The rights of the holders of common
shares may be subject to, and adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any
preferred shares that may be issued in the future. In addition, we have adopted a
classified board of directors. Our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the
entire board of directors without a super majority vote. In addition, a super majority
vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders. Shareholders do not
have the right to call a shareholders meeting. We have adopted a shareholders’ rights
plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third
parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our Board of Directors. This
shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it
more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our
shareholders.

Unlike
many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not provide for mergers
as that expression is understood under corporate law in the United States. While Cayman
Islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and
amalgamation of companies, which are commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a
“scheme of arrangement,” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to
consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the
procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States. Under Cayman
Islands law and practice, a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands
exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the
company’s shareholders who are present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at
such meeting. The shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent
at least 75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders (excluding the
shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement) present and voting at the
meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also sanction the convening of these
meetings and the terms of the amalgamation. Although there is no requirement to seek the
consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement, the Grand
Court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their
liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise
materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand Court
will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:


•  the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

•  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

•  the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably

approve; and

•  the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be

sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.

Item 7A.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Sensitivity

We
have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and
the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both
significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical
industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through
a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw
materials costs.

Inflation

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price
increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk

The
operation of the Company’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure
to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not been significantly affected
by foreign exchange fluctuations because, until recently, the New Taiwan Dollar has proven
to be relatively stable. However, periodically we have experienced significant foreign
currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The
potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a
significant effect on our results of operations.

The
principal currency involved is the New Taiwan Dollar. Garmin Corporation, located in
Shijr, Taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates
all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at
average rates during the year. In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange
fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan
subsidiary’s cash and investments marketable securities in U.S. dollars. As discussed
above, the New Taiwan dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate can be volatile. The exchange rate
decreased 5.5% during 2004 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of $24.8 million. The
exchange rate decreased 3.0% during 2003 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of $6.7
million. While the net effect of foreign currency moves in fiscal 2002 was neutral, there
were significant shifts in the exchange rate throughout 2002 A 10% positive or negative
change in the US dollar exchange rate versus the New Taiwan Dollar would have resulted in
a foreign currency gain of $47.2 million (positive 10% change) or a foreign currency loss
of $47.2 million (negative 10% change) during 2004. The majority of our worldwide sales
are transacted in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, the impact on sales related to foreign currency
movements is minimal.


Interest Rate Risk

We
have no outstanding long-term debt, and therefore no debt-related interest rate risk.

We are
exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities
will fluctuate accordingly. A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have
a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. At December 25, 2004, unrealized
losses on those securities were $1.9 million.

on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors
and Shareholders

Garmin Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December
25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 25, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 25, 2004 and December 27,
2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 25, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March 7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In Thousands, Except
Share and Per Share Information)

December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003

1.  Organization

On
July 24, 2000, the stockholders of Garmin Corporation (GARMIN) incorporated Garmin Ltd.
(the Company) under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Subsequently, the stockholders of
GARMIN executed a Shareholder’s Agreement to transfer to Garmin Ltd. their
investments in 88,988,394 common shares of stock of GARMIN. These shares, which
represented approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of GARMIN as of
July 24, 2000, were used by the stockholders to pay for their subscriptions to 100,000,000
common shares of Garmin Ltd. at a par value of $0.01 or an aggregate value of $1,000. As
such, the exchange of shares in this reorganization between GARMIN and the newly formed
holding company, Garmin Ltd., completed on September 22, 2000, has been accounted for at
historical cost similar to that in pooling-of-interests accounting. Until April 15, 2002,
one share of GARMIN stock was held by each of six shareholders as nominees under nominee
trusts in order to comply with Article 2 of the Company Law of Taiwan which required that,
as a “company limited by stock,” GARMIN have at least seven shareholders, and
4,000 shares of GARMIN were held by two shareholders who did not convert their GARMIN
shares to common shares of the Company. These 4,006 shares represented approximately
0.004% of the outstanding shares of GARMIN. Taiwan company law was subsequently changed to
remove the requirement that a Taiwan company have a minimum of seven shareholders and to
permit single shareholder companies. As of April 15, 2002, the Company acquired the 4,000
shares of GARMIN that were held by the two shareholders and the six nominee shareholders
each transferred their own share of GARMIN stock to the Company. As a result, the Company
now owns all of the outstanding shares of GARMIN. Garmin Ltd. completed an initial public
offering of its common stock in December 2000.

2.  Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
and Principles of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

Nature of Business

Garmin
Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company) manufacture, market, and distribute Global
Positioning System-enabled products and other related products. GARMIN was incorporated in
Taiwan, Republic of China on January 16, 1990. GARMIN is primarily responsible for the
manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to Garmin International,
Inc. (GII) and Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL) and, to a lesser extent, new product
development and sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Asia and the Far
East. In April 1990, a 100%-owned subsidiary, Garmin International, Inc., was incorporated
in the United States. GII is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the
Company’s products in many international markets and in the United States as well as
research and new product development. GII also manufactures certain products for the
Company’s aviation segment. During June 1992, GII formed Garmin (Europe) Limited, a
wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, to sell its products principally within the
European market. During 2000, GII sold its interest in GEL to Garmin Ltd. As a result, GEL
is now a direct subsidiary of Garmin Ltd. Also during 2000, Garmin Realty LLC was formed
by GII to hold certain real estate. In December 2001, GII formed Garmin USA as a sales
organization. During August 2003, GII acquired all the outstanding capital stock of UPS
Aviation Technologies, Inc. for $38 million in cash and renamed the company Garmin AT,
Inc. (GAT). See Note 16.


Fiscal Year

The
Company has adopted a 52–53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar
year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is
slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in
each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal
year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday
of the calendar year occurs.

In
those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of
sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial results of those
fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the
prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13
weeks. Fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2005 will include 53 weeks.

Foreign Currency
Translation

GARMIN
utilizes the New Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

, the
financial statements of GARMIN for all periods presented have been translated into United
States dollars, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd. and GII, and the reporting currency
herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales,
costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of
this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Cumulative translation adjustments of $12,075 and ($20,965) as of December 25, 2004 and
December 27, 2003, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive
gain/(loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Transactions
in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction
date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate
of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All differences are recorded in results
of operations and amounted to exchange losses of $24,819 and $6,699, and an exchange gain
of $11 for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and December 28, 2002,
respectively. The losses in fiscal 2004 and 2003 were due to weakening of the United
States dollar compared to the New Taiwan Dollar throughout the year. The very small gain
in fiscal 2002 was the result of there being little change in the United States dollar
compared to the New Taiwan Dollar during that fiscal year. These losses and gains are
included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Earnings Per Share

Basic
earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that
would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number
of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average
market price of the Company’s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
See Note 12.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or
less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value, given the short maturity of those instruments.


Inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average
method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) by GARMIN and the FIFO
method by GII, GAT and GEL. Inventories consisted of the following:

Long-Lived Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the
asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment loss shall be measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Dividends

On
July 23, 2004 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid on
December 15, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2004. The Company paid out a
dividend in the amount of $54,095. The dividend has been reported as a reduction of
retained earnings.

On
July 23, 2003 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid on
December 15, 2003 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2003. The Company paid out a
dividend in the amount of $54,040. The dividend has been reported as a reduction of
retained earnings to the extent of the stand-alone retained earnings of Garmin Ltd. The
excess has been reported as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital.

Approximately
$90,554 and $67,882 of GARMIN’s retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from
distribution to stockholders pursuant to the law of Taiwan at December 25, 2004 and
December 27, 2003, respectively.


Intangible Assets

On
December 30, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. The statement addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be
accounted for and tested for impairment. The standard requires intangibles to be
identified as either finite-lived or indefinite-lived. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are no longer subject to amortization, yet are to be tested for impairment annually and on
an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that
the asset might be impaired. The impairment test requires the determination of the value
of the intangible asset. If the value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying
value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. The
asset will then be carried at its new value. Finite-lived intangible assets are still
subject to amortization and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company.

At
December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, the Company had patents, license agreements,
customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets
recorded at a cost of $85,909 and $48,703, respectively. The Company’s excess
purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $12,218 at December
25, 2004 and December 27, 2003.

Identifiable,
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a
straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization was $38,642 and
$17,810 at December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, respectively. Amortization expense was
$20,832, $6,886, and $5,277 for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and
December 28, 2002, respectively. In the next five years, the amortization expense is
estimated to be $17,705, $16,644, $2,180, $1,369, and $1,262, respectively.

Marketable Securities

Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase
and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.

All
of the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at December
25, 2004. See Note 3. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain. During
2004, unrealized losses of ($3,407) were reported in other comprehensive gain, net of
related taxes.

The
amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of
mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is
included in interest income from investments. Realized gains and losses, and declines in
value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in net securities gains (losses). The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period.

Income Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with SFAS No.
109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The liability method provides that deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as
measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse. Income taxes have not been accrued by Garmin Corporation for the
unremitted earnings of GII totaling approximately $167,567 and $112,567 at December 25,
2004 and December 27, 2003, respectively, because such earnings are intended to be
reinvested in this subsidiary indefinitely. Income taxes have also not been accrued by the
Company for the unremitted earnings of Garmin Corporation or GEL because such earnings are
also intended to be reinvested in these subsidiaries indefinitely.

Our
income tax liability balance includes tax contingencies that are recorded to address
potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by
taxing authorities. These exposures result from the varying applications of statutes,
rules, regulations, and interpretations. Our tax contingencies are established based on
judgements about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions and relate primarily, but not
limited to, transfer pricing positions we have taken in a variety of the countries in
which we operate, certain tax credits, and various foreign and state tax matters. The
ultimate resolution of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount we
have accrued and could have a material effect on our effective tax rate in the period when
such matter is resolved.


Use of Estimates

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

The
Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established
credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is
granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements and consistently have been within management’s expectations.
Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales
variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company and the impact those
releases may have on the cash flow requirements of our customers.

Revenue Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to the customer
and title has transferred. The Company assumes no remaining significant obligations
associated with the product sale other than that related to its warranty programs
discussed below.

Shipping and Handling
Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Product Warranty

The
Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty period is
generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception of certain aviation
products for which the warranty period is two years from the date of installation.

Sales Programs

The
Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers based on various
factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth. Additionally, from time to time,
the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products. Estimated rebates and
incentives payable to distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses
on a monthly basis. In addition, the Company provides retailers with product discounts
termed “price protection” to assist these retailers in clearing older products
from their inventories in advance of new product releases. These rebates, incentives, and
price protections are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

Advertising Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense charged to operations
amounted to approximately $29,577, $22,071, and $16,670 for the years ended December 25,
2004, December 27, 2003, and December 28, 2002, respectively.


Research and Development

Substantially
all research and development is performed by GII in the United States. Research and
development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $61,580,
$43,706, and $32,163 for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and
December 28, 2002, respectively.

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

At
December 25, 2004, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 11. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, to stock-based employee compensation.

Derivative Investments
and Hedging Activities

The
Company applies SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, to its derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement
requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
Derivatives not considered hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.

If
a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value
of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
asset, liability or firm commitment through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

GII
has historically entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest
characteristics of portions of its outstanding long-term debt from a floating rate to a
fixed rate basis. These agreements involved the receipt of floating rate amounts in
exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an
exchange of the underlying principal amount. The differential to be paid or received is
accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
related to the debt. The related amount payable to or receivable from the counterparty is
included in other liabilities or assets. The Company’s agreements have previously
qualified for hedge accounting as permitted in SFAS No. 133, resulting in the agreements
being marked to market at each balance sheet date through other comprehensive income.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the hedge relationship on a periodic basis during
the year. See Note 8.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, which is
a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No.123 (R) requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25‘s intrinsic
value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock
options at the date of grant. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No.123(R)‘s fair
value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations, although it will
have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No.123(R)
cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments
granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No.123(R) in prior periods, the impact
of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No.123 as described in the
disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share as noted above. SFAS No.123(R)
also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to
be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required
under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and
increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption.


In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No.
46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.” Interpretation No. 46
requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest
entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the Company that has the
controlling financial interest. Interpretation No. 46 also provides the framework for
determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting
interests or significant financial support provided to it. Interpretation No. 46 will
become effective for the Company on March 31, 2004 for variable interest entities created
prior to December 31, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 to have
a material impact on our results and operations or financial condition.

4.  Long-Term Debt

During
1995, GII entered into an agreement with the City of Olathe, Kansas for the construction
of a new corporate headquarters (the project) which was financed through issuance of
Series 1995 Industrial Revenue Bonds (the Bonds) totaling $9,500. Upon completion of the
project in 1996, GII retired bonds totaling $155. During 2002, GII retired the remaining
Bonds totaling $9,345.

During
1999, GARMIN borrowed $18,040 to finance the purchase of land and a new manufacturing
facility in Taiwan. The balance was due in 60 equal payments of principal plus interest
beginning in November 2001. Through November 2001, interest was payable at a fixed rate of
6.155%. Subsequent to November 2001, interest was adjustable based on the Republic of
China’s government preferential rate on term deposits plus 0.18%. The Company opted
to prepay a significant portion of the outstanding principal during 2001. The outstanding
balance of $2,891 at December 29, 2001 was paid in full in January 2002.

During
2000, GII entered into another agreement with the City of Olathe, Kansas to finance the
Company’s expansion of its manufacturing facilities through the issuance of Series
2000 Industrial Revenue Bonds (the 2000 Bonds) totaling $20,000. The proceeds from the
issuance of the 2000 Bonds were placed in an interest-bearing restricted cash account
controlled by a trustee appointed by the issuer. Disbursements from the account were
restricted to purchases of equipment and construction related to the project and amounted
to $0 and $5,696 for years ended December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively.
There were no unexpended bond proceeds in this restricted cash account at December 28,
2002. During the second quarter of 2003, GII instructed the trustee of the 2000 Bonds to
call them at par, leaving an outstanding principal of $0 at December 27, 2003.


5.  Commitments and
Contingencies

Rental
expense related to office, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $608, $324, and
$281 for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and December 28, 2002,
respectively.

Future
minimum lease payments are as follows:

Year

Amount


$512









Thereafter

3,452

At
December 25, 2004, the Company expects future costs of approximately $900 for the
completion of its facility expansion in Olathe, Kansas.

Certain
cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank securing payment of the United
Kingdom value-added tax requirements. These amounted to $1,457 and $1,602 at December 25,
2004 and December 27, 2003, respectively, and are reported as restricted cash.

In
the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various
legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and
other intellectual property claims and various other risks. It is not possible to predict
with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be
successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be. However,
the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

6.  Employee Benefit Plans

GII
sponsors an employee retirement plan under which its employees may contribute up to 50% of
their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to
which GII contributes a specified percentage of each participant’s annual
compensation up to certain limits as defined in the Plan. Additionally, GEL has a defined
contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 5% of their annual
compensation. Both GII and GEL contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion
of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003,
and December 28, 2002, expense related to these plans of $5,183, $4,197, and $2,728,
respectively, was charged to operations.

Certain
of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension
plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27,
2003, and December 28, 2002 were significant.


7.  Income Taxes

The
Company’s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:

The income
tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income
tax rate to income before taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences are as

2003, and December 28, 2002, respectively. The tax incentives and credits received from
Taiwan included in the table above reflect $0.45, $0.38, and $0.10 per weighted-average
common share outstanding for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and
December 28, 2002, respectively. The Company currently expects to benefit from the
incentives and credits being offered by Taiwan through 2009, at which time these tax
benefits expire.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities are as follows:


8.  Interest Rate Risk
Management

During 1996, GII entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert a portion of its floating rate
long-term debt associated with the Bonds to a fixed rate basis, thus, reducing the impact
of interest rate changes on future income. The agreement was renewed in 2001. Pursuant to
this “pay-fixed” swap agreement, GII agreed to exchange, at specified intervals,
the difference between the fixed and the floating interest amounts calculated on the
notional amount of the swap agreement totaling $5,000 at December 28, 2002. GII’s
fixed interest rate under the swap agreement was 5.1%. The counterparty’s floating
rate was based on the nontaxable PSA Municipal Swap Index and amounted to 1.18% at
December 28, 2002.

During
2000, GII entered into an additional swap agreement to effectively convert a portion of
additional floating rate long-term debt associated with the 2000 Bonds to a fixed rate
basis. Pursuant to this pay-fixed swap agreement, GII agreed to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between the fixed and the floating interest amounts calculated
on the notional amount of the swap agreement totaling $10,000 at December 28, 2002.
GII’s fixed interest rate under the swap agreement was 7.26% compared to the
counterparty’s floating rate of 1.51% at December 28, 2002. The counterparty’s
floating rate was based on the bank’s Taxable Low Floater Rate.

The
fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of other
accrued expenses and amounted to $1,046 at December 28, 2002. During the second quarter of
2003, GII liquidated its interest rate swap positions and realized the loss previously
recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss. None of the Company’s cash flow
hedges were deemed ineffective.

10.  Segment Information

The Company operates within its
targeted markets through two reportable segments, those being related to products sold
into the consumer and aviation markets. Both of the Company’s reportable segments
offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors.
However, the nature of products and types of customers for the two segments vary
significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. The Company’s consumer
segment includes portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories for
marine, recreation, land, and automotive use sold primarily to retail outlets. These
products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The
Company’s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight
Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers
and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM
evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income before income taxes of each
segment.

Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses
including certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense,
foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses. The accounting
policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The identifiable assets associated
with each reportable segment reviewed by the CODM include accounts receivable and
inventories. The Company does not report property and equipment, intangible assets,
depreciation and amortization, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

payments from this customer have reduced the customer’s accounts receivable balance
to $0.8 million.

11.  Stock Compensation
Plans

The
various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below:

2000 Equity Incentive
Plan

In
October 2000, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the Plan) providing for
grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and “other” stock
compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up
to 3,500,000 shares of common stock were available for issuance. The stock options
generally vest over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of
grant, if not exercised. Option activity under the Plan during 2004, 2003, and 2002 is
summarized below. There have been no “other” stock compensation awards granted
under the Plan.

2000 Non-employee
Directors’ Option Plan

Also
in October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors
(the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up to 50,000 common shares of the
Company’s stock. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over a
three-year period. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, options to purchase 6,621, 3,648, and
5,058 shares were granted under this plan.


A
summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information under the 2000
Equity Incentive Plan and the 2000 Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan for the years
ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003, and December 28, 2002 is provided below:

SFAS No. 123 requires the pro forma information be determined as if the Company has
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement. As
described below, the fair value accounting provided under SFAS No. 123 requires the use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003, and
2002: risk-free interest rate of 3.80%, 4.25%, and 1.67%, respectively; dividend yields of
1.3% and 1.0% for 2004 and 2003, respectively, and no dividend yield for 2002; volatility
factor of the expected market price of the Company’s common stock of 0.3577, 0.3927,
and 0.3395, respectively; and a weighted-average expected life of the option of six years
in 2004, six years in 2003, and seven years in 2002.


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes
in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The
stockholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up to 1,000,000 shares
of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares will be offered to employees at a
price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of
purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to
qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, 58,950, 70,857, and 70,035 shares were
purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $2,690, $1,805, and $1,265,
respectively. At December 25, 2004, approximately 677,000 shares were available for future
issuance.

12.  Earnings Per Share

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:

Options
to purchase 141 shares of common stock at $54.54 per share were outstanding during 2004,
48 shares of common stock at $54.54 per share were outstanding during 2003, and 472 shares
of common stock at prices ranging from $21.67 to $29.79 per share were outstanding during
2002 but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares and, therefore, the effect was antidilutive.


13.  Share Repurchase
Program

On
April 21, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock through April 30, 2006. Through
December 25, 2004, the Company had purchased 100,000 shares at $3,182.

14.  Shareholder Rights
Plan

On
October 24, 2001, Garmin’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the
“Rights Plan”). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend of
one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share of Garmin to
shareholders of record as of November 1, 2001. The rights trade together with
Garmin’s common shares. The rights generally will become exercisable if a person or
group acquires or announces an intention to acquire 15% or more of Garmin’s
outstanding common shares. Each right (other than those held by the new 15% shareholder)
will then be exercisable to purchase preferred shares of Garmin (or in certain instances
other securities of Garmin) having at that time a market value equal to two times the then
current exercise price. Garmin’s Board of Directors may redeem the rights at $0.002
per right at any time before the rights become exercisable. The rights expire on October
31, 2011.

16.  Garmin AT Acquisition

On
August 22, 2003, GII acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of UPS Aviation
Technologies, Inc. for $38 million in cash. UPS Aviation Technologies, headquartered in
Salem, Oregon, designs and manufactures multiple lines of communications, navigation and
surveillance products for general aviation and air transport customers.

The
purchase price of the UPS Aviation Technologies acquisition was allocated to the estimated
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management’s
estimates and third-party appraisals. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets acquired was allocated to deductible goodwill in the amount of $11.4 million.
UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc. was subsequently renamed Garmin AT, Inc. by the Company.
The results of Garmin AT, Inc. are included in the financial statements for the period
from August 22, 2003 to December 27, 2003 and the fiscal year ended December 25, 2004.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

(a)  
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and

Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(c) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b)  
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management
of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 25, 2004. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”.

Based
on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004.

Ernst
& Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. That attestation report appears below.


(c)  
Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting

Firm

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors
and Shareholders

Garmin Ltd.

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd. and
Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 25, 2004, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries

as of December
25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 25, 2004 of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 7, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(d)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 25, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting

CERTIFICATION

I,
Min H. Kao, certify that:

1.

I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Garmin Ltd.;

2.

Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue statement
                    of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
                    statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were

3.

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
                    information included in this annual report, fairly present in all material
                    respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
                    registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this annual report;

4.

The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for
                    establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
                    Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial

                    annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                    materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
                    reporting;

5.

The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
                    our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
                    registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of
                    directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
                    of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
                    adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and
                    report financial information; and

b)

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
                    who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over
                    financial reporting.

                    annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
