Part I

Item 1.

Business

This discussion of the
business of Garmin Ltd. ("Garmin" or the "Company") should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by
reference to, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7
herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference
in partial response to this Item 1. Garmin has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes: auto, aviation,
marine, outdoor and fitness. There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but are
aggregated within the auto reportable segment. Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating
Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually. The segment and geographic
information included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” under Note 8 is incorporated herein
by reference in partial response to this Item 1.

Garmin was incorporated
in Switzerland on February 9, 2010 as successor to Garmin Ltd., a Cayman Islands company (“Garmin Cayman”). Garmin
Cayman was incorporated on July 24, 2000 as a holding company for Garmin Corporation, a Taiwan corporation, in order to facilitate
a public offering of Garmin Cayman shares in the United States. On June 27, 2010, Garmin became the ultimate parent holding company
of the Garmin group of companies pursuant to a share exchange transaction effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation
of the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the “Redomestication”).
Pursuant to the Redomestication, all issued and outstanding Garmin Cayman common shares were transferred to Garmin and each common
share, par value U.S. $0.005 per share, of Garmin Cayman was exchanged for one registered share, par value 10 Swiss francs (CHF)
per share, of Garmin. At the Company’s Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved
the cancellation of 10,000,000 registered shares of the Company held by the Company (the “Formation Shares”) and the
reduction in par value of each share of the Company from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company’s Articles of
Association to effect a corresponding share capital reduction. This share cancellation has reduced authorized shares from 208,077,418
shares to 198,077,418 shares, with an incremental 99,038,709 conditional shares that may be issued through the exercise of option
rights, which are granted to Garmin employees or members of its Board of Directors. Garmin owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the operating companies in the Garmin group.

Company Overview

For over 25 years, Garmin
Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) has pioneered new Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and wireless
devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. Garmin serves five primary business units,
including auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor. We believe it is through these business units that Garmin is able to achieve
synergies in raw material purchases, manufacturing, distribution, research and development and marketing efforts making for a stronger,
more effective company. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a diverse family of hand-held, wearable,
portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications, sensor-based and information products. Since
the inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 188 million products, which includes the delivery of more than 15 million
products during 2017.

Overview of the Global Positioning System

The Global Positioning System
is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology.
The system consists of numerous constellations of orbiting satellites. Access to the systems is provided free of charge.

Garmin utilizes a variety
of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) including, but not limited to:

·

The
satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense,
which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.

·

Japan’s
MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) which achieved initial operating capability for enroute, terminal and approach
navigation for aviation on September 27, 2007.

·

The
European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) aviation Safety of Life (SoL) service which achieved initial operating
capability for enroute, terminal, and approach navigation on March 2, 2011.

·

The
Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), a space-based satellite navigation system operated by the Russian Federation, consisting
of 24 satellites and providing world-wide coverage.

·

The Galileo system, a global navigation satellite system that is currently being built by the European
Union and European Space Agency with 30 total satellites planned for orbit (24 operational and six active spares), of which 14
are currently operational. Complete operational status is expected by 2020.

In certain urban canyon or restricted sky visibility situations, the combination of GPS, GLONASS, and/or
Galileo satellites to produce a navigation fix may result in improved accuracy.

On a subscription basis,
certain Garmin products offer access to the Iridium satellite network, a synchronized constellation of 66 low Earth orbit (LEO)
satellites offering global data communication coverage. The Iridium network is the only network that spans the entire globe, offering
100 percent coverage worldwide to enable satellite-based communication.

The accuracy and utility
of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) comprising
ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States
and most of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of
WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications.

Manufacturing and Operations

Garmin believes one of
its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi,
Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes
that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability
and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.


Specifically, Garmin believes
that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality and time to market.

Cost:

Garmin’s
manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency,
resulting in lower cost. Garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high,
mid and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects Garmin’s costs to produce
its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products. The ownership and
integration of our resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products, yielding improved cost.

Quality:

Garmin’s
automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables
Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our
products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing
integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.

Time to Market:

Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products,
allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable
faster time to market.

Garmin’s design,
manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001,
an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s automotive operations
in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin’s
Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.

Garmin International, Inc.,
Garmin (Europe) Ltd. and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO
14001 standard, recognizing Garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and
continually strive to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Although most components
essential to Garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained
by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components
that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM),
GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.

Garmin and other participants
in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, Garmin uses some
custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics
industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin
has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has
increased. Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically
important components. Nevertheless, if Garmin’s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was
delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor
delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. Garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required
to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate
on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin’s requirements.


Seasonality

Our net sales are subject
to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during
the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.
Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation and auto OEM products
do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of
new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

Our sales are generally
of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information
is not material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability
to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often
relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography
technology for use in our products from various sources.

As of January 5, 2018, Garmin’s
worldwide IP portfolio included over 1,100 patent and 750 trademark registrations. The duration of patents varies in accordance
with the provisions of applicable local law. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees
and their ability to continue to innovate.  Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate
to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

There is no assurance that
our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is
also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will
preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized
parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The telecommunications industry
is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with the United
States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified
by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required
to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or
enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our
business. In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required
to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before
they can be used in an aircraft.


Because Garmin Corporation,
one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan
with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange
Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred
to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from
exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the
import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks. Aside from trade-related
foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan
foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits
apply to remittances involving a conversion between Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies. The CBC typically
approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons
justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign
debt with the CBC.

Environmental Matters

Garmin’s operations
are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances
and wastes.  Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget.

Environmental regulation
of Garmin’s products is increasing.  Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and
material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.  Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers
to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Compliance
with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental
laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

Garmin has implemented
multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards,
and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility,
Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan and China manufacturing facilities.

Garmin continues to strive
to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts.  Our manufacturing locations have implemented
increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete Garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream. Additionally,
our new facility design has been constructed with energy efficient considerations, including reduced water consumption, LED lighting,
and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation.

Employees

As of December 30, 2017,
Garmin had approximately 12,300 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 4,700 were in North America, 5,100
were in Taiwan, 1,500 were in Europe, and 1,000 were in other global locations. Except for some of Garmin’s employees in
Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or
Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations to be positive.


Item 1A. Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the only
ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial
may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results
could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Company

If we are not successful in the continued
development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease
to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset.

We expect that a significant
portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. This is particularly important
to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories. The market for our products is characterized by
rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or
to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products
could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development
in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However,
there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant
customer acceptance.

If we are unable to successfully
develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely
affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies
to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change
the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as
they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance
that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these products in volume and
their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to
product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we are unable to compete effectively
with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders,
reduced margins and loss of market share.

The markets for many of
our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or
emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. Increased competition could result in
price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against
current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Maturation or contraction of the market
for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits.

We have experienced growth
in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable
devices. In 2017, the fitness tracker market rapidly contracted, resulting in lower sales and profits in our fitness segment. If
the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly,
our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.

The demand for personal navigation devices
(PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed
systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.

GPS/navigation technologies
have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. The acceptance of this technology by consumers has
reduced sales in the auto segment and has reduced profits in some periods. Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent
as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles
is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits.

The auto segment, which represents approximately
24% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2018.

We experienced substantial
growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as PNDs became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North
America. This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. This has resulted in, and is
expected to continue to result in, lower revenues and profits for this segment.

Our annual and quarterly financial statements
will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The operation of our subsidiaries
in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency
gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies. The potential
of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. We have
not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The currencies that typically
create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. The Taiwan Dollar is the
functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is
the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in
British Pounds. Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. Due to the relative size of entities
using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are
not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

We translate income and
expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange
in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense activity in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar can be impacted by exchange
rate variations over time. The majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate
impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal
entity. Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. However, because there is minimal cash impact caused
by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency
gains and losses.


Changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes
could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.

Our tax position could
be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by
any tax authority in which we file income tax returns. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Legislative
proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the
taxes applicable to us in Switzerland. Switzerland has agreed with the European Union (EU) to execute tax reform by 2019 in exchange
for the EU’s waiver of counter-measures. A failure to accomplish tax reform in the agreed timeframe may result in the EU
member states reasserting counter-measure provisions which could result in additional tax for the Company.

Moreover, international
taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations
aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations. While these recommendations are not
changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse
effects to our income tax provision and financial statements.

Significant judgment is
required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we
believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially
different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect
on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Restrictions on trade, particularly on goods
imported from Taiwan or the People’s Republic of China, could significantly harm our results of operations

A significant portion of
our global and U.S. sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China. The imposition of additional U.S. or foreign governmental controls, regulations that create new or enhanced
restrictions on free trade with the U.S., or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including goods imported from
China and Taiwan, could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition.

Economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty
could adversely affect our revenue and profits.

Our revenue and profits
depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness
or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased
revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties
experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs
and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

The United Kingdom (UK)
is scheduled to formally leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. Due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal,
significant uncertainty exists surrounding the terms of the expected exit. We have operations in the UK and several EU member states
whose currencies, namely British Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro, economies, taxation, and trade regulation, among other factors,
could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the UK’s leaving the EU, which is likely to be a complicated
process. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.


If we do not correctly anticipate demand
for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have
costly excess production or inventories.

We have generally been able
to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. However, the demand for our products depends on many factors
and may be difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a
diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products
mature. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:

•

If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have
to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might
not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.

•

Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated
demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could lower
our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our
margins and reduce customer satisfaction.

•

If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess
inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess
inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies
at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.

We depend on third party suppliers and licensors,
some of which are sole source, for specific components and map data used in our products. Our production and business would be
seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs
of components rise.

We are dependent on third
party suppliers for various components used in our current products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers
include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. The
cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Some components
we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are
manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.

In the past, we have experienced
shortages of certain components. In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may
rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative
source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production
of our products would be seriously harmed.

We are also dependent on
third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products. There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data
for some of our products and geographical regions. The largest digital map supplier for our auto products is HERE (formerly known
as NAVTEQ), which is majority-owned by a consortium of Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Audi AG. Although we do not foresee difficulty in
continuing to license data from HERE at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement with an option to extend through
2028, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from HERE and other primary suppliers and are unable to obtain an
alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with primary suppliers changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping
data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.


Our intellectual property rights are important
to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others.

We rely on a combination
of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications
to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications
will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. In addition, effective copyright,
patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. Moreover, even if approved,
our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of
reasons. Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.

The value of our products
relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. Third parties may claim that
we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals
and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract
settlements from us or our customers. The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in
the future. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. From time to time we receive
letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are,
a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and
time consuming. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable
terms. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use
of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.

We may become subject to significant product
liability costs.

If our aviation products
malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury
or death. Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other
wreckage, personal injury or death. If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party
map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur
resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability
for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance
would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially
reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated
legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product
liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse
outcomes.

We are subject to a variety
of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive
relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties
and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer
unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. A material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably
estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our products may contain undetected security
vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty
claims, and litigation

Undiscovered vulnerabilities
in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, and other malicious
software programs that could attack our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation
and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products.

We collect, store, process, and use personal
information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy,
information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.

We collect, store, process,
and use personal information and other user data. Our users’ personal information may include, among other information, names,
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns,
GPS-based location, and activity patterns. Due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature
of our products and applications, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. If our security measures
or applications are breached, disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. If we or our third-party
service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience
a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures
or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our
products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. Depending
on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user
data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals
affected by the incident. A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements
in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach notification laws continue
to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial
costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. Our users may also accidentally
disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers
are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service
providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users’ information
at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy
terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance
coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber
risk.

Regulatory authorities around
the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, and a new data protection
regulation in the E.U. with significant fines and penalties for noncompliance will go into effect in May 2018. In addition, the
interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and
in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation
and data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our
data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws
could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.


We rely on information technology systems for our business operations.
Failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation
and adversely affect our business and result of operations.

Our information technology
systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively. These systems assist in our business processes,
including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, order processing, shipping and billing
and providing services and support to our customers. Additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual
property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information
of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this
information is important to our operations. A disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results
of operations. Furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant
data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary
business information or personally identifiable information.  A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive
position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as
a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products
or services.

We have technology and
processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time,
we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications
we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly
compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud,
trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques
or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate
training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate
this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.

Actual or anticipated
attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies,
to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. Our technology errors and
omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach
or system failure. If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational
and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In
addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject
us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability,
damages, or remediation costs.

Gross margins for our products may fluctuate
or erode.

Gross margins in some
of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material
cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including
product mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over
that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements
and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced
features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent that such
cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We may experience unique economic and political risks associated
with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Our principal manufacturing
facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in Taiwan. Relations between Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the
future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity
of our shares.


The PRC asserts sovereignty
over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the
legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years
between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain
circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the
1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as
the "one-China" policy. Deviations from the "one-China" policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S.
and China-Taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.

Changes in our United States federal
income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater U.S. shareholders.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “2017 Act”) signed on December 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to U.S. shareholders that own, or
are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a
non-U.S. corporation (a 10% U.S. shareholder) under the U.S. Federal income tax law applicable to owners of U.S. controlled foreign
corporations (“CFCs”).

Prior to the 2017 Act,
the Company did not believe we, or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, were considered a CFC, which is a determination made daily
based on whether the 10% U.S. shareholders together own, or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules, more than
fifty percent of the voting power or value of a non-U.S. corporation.  The 2017 Act repealed Internal Revenue Code Section
958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries as CFCs with respect to any single 10% U.S. shareholder. This may be the result without regard to whether
10% U.S. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company
as was the case under prior rules. The repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of CFCs beginning before January 1, 2018
and for the taxable year of 10% U.S. shareholders in which the CFCs' taxable year ends.

Additional tax consequences
to 10% U.S. shareholders of a CFC may result from other provisions of the 2017 Act. For example, the 2017 Act amended Section 965
to require 10% U.S. shareholders to include in income their pro-rata share of certain earnings and profits (E&P) of CFCs. 
This Section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividends-received deduction.  The 2017 Act also added Section 951A
which requires a 10% U.S. shareholder of a CFC to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income
(GILTI) of the CFC.  Finally, the 2017 Act eliminated the requirement in Section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation
be considered a CFC for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% U.S. shareholder to have a current income
inclusion.

From time to time, the Company may elect to employ antidilutive
measures such as a stock buyback program. These measures could inadvertently create additional 10% U.S. shareholders and thus trigger
adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above. We urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers
for advice regarding the 2017 Act revisions to the U.S. Federal income tax law applicable to owners of CFCs given the current uncertainty
regarding their scope of applicability.

Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on
a timely basis could harm our business.

We have certain products,
especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce
new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes. Delays in our obtaining certification
for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we cannot assure that our certified
products will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.


Our business may suffer if we are not able
to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our future success depends
partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance
payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. We do not have key person
life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The loss of the services
of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel
we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide
shortage of qualified engineers in the United States who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore,
it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able
to maintain and expand our business.

Our quarterly operating results are subject
to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our operating results are
difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline, the
price of our stock could decline. As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development
costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and
development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically, our revenues
have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying
is traditionally lower in this quarter. Sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine and automotive products tend to be higher
in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. Sales
of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns
on electronic devices during the holiday season. In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively
higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.

We rely on independent dealers and distributors
to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because we sell many of
our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory
levels and support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in
their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient
levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.

Many of our dealers and
distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable
terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain
or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with
dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.


We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments,
strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete
and integrate such transactions.

We intend to evaluate acquisition
opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter
into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional
distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment
or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those
transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any past or future acquisition
could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s
attention away from other business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to
integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide
not to work for us. We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other
corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. If we fail to
successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

There is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to
enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.

We are a Swiss company and
a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be difficult
to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland
or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in
Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration
operations would harm our business.

Any failure of the
United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of
FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and
registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.

Many of our products rely on the Global
Positioning System and other Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS).

The Global Positioning System
(GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites
and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department
of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems
are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally
designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. However,
of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.

To repair damaged or malfunctioning
satellites is currently not economically feasible. If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could
be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair
the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. GPS satellites and ground
control segments are being modernized. GPS modernization software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access to open
technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.


GPS is operated by the U.S.
Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer
supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, and financial condition.

Some of our products also
use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS),
Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS). Any curtailment
of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our
markets.

Some of our products also
use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System. Other countries, including China and India, are in the process of creating
their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use GNSS signals from these systems. The European
community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo. National or European authorities may
provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm
our competitive position. Use of non-US GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon
international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using
these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue.

Any of the foregoing factors
could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based
on competing technologies.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused
by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.

Acts of war or acts of
terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results,
and financial condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future
acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such
interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.

A shut down of airspace
or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of
our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to
our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers
and distributors.

Any reallocation or repurposing of radio
frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference
could harm our business.

Our Global Positioning System
technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning
System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation
satellite services. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty
status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each
country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations
and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or national reallocation
of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted
uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant
negative impacts on our business and our customers.


Natural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change
could affect our financial results.

Natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, could occur in a region
where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory.

If our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to
minimize business disruption and/or if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events,
our financial results could be adversely affected.

Climate change can also
pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. The Environmental Protection
Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act. At the federal
legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction,
such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
It is also possible that the U.S. Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade
program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business.

Because
it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations
on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment
in our common shares.

The market price of our
shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During 2017, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low
of $47.35 to a high of $62.92. A variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

·

general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations
in interest rates and global currency exchange rates;

·

announcements of technological innovations;

·

product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;

·

developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

·

the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components,
such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products;

·

quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;

·

changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates;

·

developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and
litigation;

·

announcements and rumors of developments related to our business,
our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete;

·

research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage
houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers;

·

any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan
or significant markets where we sell our products; and

·

other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.


In addition, in recent
years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in
the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As of January 17, 2018,
members of our Board of Directors, and our executive officers, and Gary Burrell (our co-founder and former executive officer and
member of our Board of Directors), together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related
to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 39.99% of our outstanding shares. Accordingly, these shareholders
may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and
shareholder proposals. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.

The rights of our shareholders are governed
by Swiss law.

The
rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.’s articles of association. The rights of shareholders
under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law
allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors
without approval of a shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital
and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally,
subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive
rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide
as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority
in some other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders
at the general meeting of shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility,
and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.

We have limited capital reserves from which
to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders Swiss withholding tax.

If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying
capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a
rate of 35%. Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for
par value reductions or dividends will be limited.  The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid
to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States
of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund
of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders
with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). However, there can
be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution
reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules
will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular
as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other
restrictions. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital
contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes


Under current Swiss tax
law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding
tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed
to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax. Therefore,
repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders
free of Swiss withholding taxes.  No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares
are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are
available. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution
reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period.

We may follow a share repurchase
process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss
institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of
the Swiss withholding tax. However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares
for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that
the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. No withholding tax would be applicable if
and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.

We have certain limitations on our ability
to repurchase and hold our own shares.

Under Swiss law we have
certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold
our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss
tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may
not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however,
if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase
registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Our ability to repurchase
and hold our own shares has been a component of our capital management and shareholder return practices, and any restriction on
our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2. Properties

The following are the principal
properties owned or leased by the Company and its subsidiaries:

Garmin International,
Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. occupy facilities of approximately 1,215,000 square feet on approximately 107 acres in Olathe,
Kansas, where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the Matter of Certain
Marine Sonar Imaging Devices, Including Downscan and Sidescan Devices, Products Containing the Same, and Components Thereof

On June 9, 2014 Navico
Inc. and Navico Holding AS (collectively “Navico”) filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission
(“ITC”) alleging the Company infringed upon three specific Navico patents relating to downscan sonar. On December 1,
2015, the ITC issued a Final Determination concluding that there was infringement by Garmin. On August 30, 2016, Navico filed a
request that the ITC initiate an enforcement proceeding for alleged violations by Garmin of the previous cease and desist orders
issued by the ITC. On May 26, 2017, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial enforcement determination concluding that Garmin’s
sale of certain DownVü sonar products violated the ITC’s December 2015 orders and recommended a civil penalty of $37
million. On June 13, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) reversed the ITC’s
Final Determination. Specifically, the Federal Circuit ruled that the two of the three patents in the suit are invalid and that
Garmin does not infringe upon the third patent. The ITC stayed the issuance of a final determination in this enforcement proceeding
pending the issuance by the Federal Circuit of its mandate. The Federal Circuit issued its mandate on October 31, 2017. Pursuant
to the settlement agreement described below on February 14, 2018, Garmin and Navico filed a joint motion to terminate the enforcement
proceeding.


Navico Inc. And Navico
Holding AS v. Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc.

On June 4, 2014
Navico filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma alleging the Company infringed
upon the same three specific Navico patents relating to downscan sonar that are the subject of their complaint filed with ITC
discussed above. On January 15, 2016 the court issued an order staying this lawsuit pending the final determination of any
appeal filed with the Federal Circuit concerning that ITC complaint. On October 31, 2017 the Federal Circuit issued its
mandate in that appeal holding that two of the three patents in suit are invalid and that Garmin does not infringe upon the
third patent. On November 14, 2017, the Oklahoma court lifted the stay and set a briefing schedule. The parties have
submitted briefing on the effect of the Federal Circuit’s decision and the court scheduled a hearing on March 12, 2018.
This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on February 13, 2018 pursuant to the settlement agreement described below.

Navico Inc. And Navico
Holding AS v. Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc.

On
March 4, 2016, Navico filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division
alleging the Company infringed upon two specific Navico patents relating to downscan sonar. On September 8, 2017, a jury
returned a verdict finding that Garmin had willfully infringed upon those two patents and awarded damages of $38 million. No
judgment was entered by the court.

This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on February 13, 2018 pursuant to the
settlement agreement described below.

On January 24, 2018,
Garmin and Navico agreed on a global settlement of all pending litigation between them. The settlement is not material to the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. The parties have agreed to keep the terms of the settlement confidential.

PulseOn Oy v. Garmin
(Europe) Ltd.

On November 11, 2016, PulseOn
Oy filed suit in the Patents Court in London, England, against Garmin (Europe) Ltd. alleging infringement of alleged UK unregistered
design rights and Registered European Community Design No. 002473769-0004 (the “0004 Design”) and Registered European
Community Design No. 002473769-005 (the “0005 Design”) by certain Garmin products with wrist-worn heart rate monitors.
A trial was held in November 2017. During the trial PulseOn abandoned its claim of infringement of alleged UK unregistered design
rights. On January 18, 2018 the court issued a judgment holding that no accused Garmin products infringed either the 0004 Design
or the 0005 Design.

In the normal course of
business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
patent infringement, other intellectual property, product liability, customer claims and various other risks. It is not possible
to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters,
or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company settled or resolved
certain other matters during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material
impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure

None.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations,
certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the
consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified
by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including
the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed
above in Item 1A.

As previously noted,
the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future
events. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,”
“anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions
on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could
materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of
factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly
encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement. Except as may be required by law, we
do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal year
is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal year 2017 contains 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks
for 2016 and 52 weeks for 2015. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal
periods. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our"
and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated,
dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide
provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
technology. We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, auto, and aviation markets. Our segments
offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of
products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately.

Since our first products
were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of
these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its
estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


For information on each of the following critical
accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are primarily
generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers. Refer to
the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature;
therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders
we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject to
seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during
the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Our aviation
and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications
and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Cost of
Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs are
our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage
lower cost components. We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants
in Taiwan; Yangzhou manufacturing plant in China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to
experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales price variability
has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market
have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points. In recent years, pricing has
stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs. The average
selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the
introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix
of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.


Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses
consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of:

·

salaries
for sales, marketing and product support personnel;

·

salaries
and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

·

marketing,
and other brand building costs;

·

accounting
and legal costs;

·

information
systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel
and related costs; and

·

occupancy
and other overhead costs.

Research and Development

The majority of our research
and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype
development.

We are committed to increasing
the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer
and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively
low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory
rates. In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership
of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate.

In 2016, the Company moved
action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with
other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment. The overall impact of the move was immaterial. However, action camera
related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation.

The following table sets
forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown. For each line item
in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included
in Item 6.

Net sales increased 2%
in 2017 when compared to the year-ago period. Outdoor, marine, and aviation segments had an increase in revenue, while fitness
and auto segments had a decrease in revenue. Fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 25% in 2017,
which was a slight decline from 27% in 2016. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2016 at 29% and
declined to 24% in 2017.

Total unit sales decreased
8% to 15.4 million units in the 52-weeks ended 2017 from 16.8 million units in the 53-weeks ended 2016.


Auto segment revenue decreased
15% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction. Fitness segment revenue decreased 7% from the
year-ago period, primary driven by the general decline of the basic activity tracker market. Outdoor, marine, and aviation revenues
increased 28%, 13%, and 14%, respectively when compared to the year-ago period. Growth in outdoor was driven by growth in our wearables
and subscriptions categories. Our marine segment revenue increased primarily due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment
systems, and the newly acquired Navionics. Aviation revenues increased due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.

Cost of goods sold decreased
3% in absolute dollars for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 when compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.

The auto segment cost of
goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline. In the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments, the decrease
in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues was a result of a shift in product mix toward higher margin products. The aviation
segment increase in cost of goods sold was generally consistent with the segment revenue increase.

Gross profit dollars in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 increased 6% while gross profit margin increased
210 basis points compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the
increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage. Outdoor, fitness, and marine segment increases to gross profit margin
were primarily due to product mix within those segments. Auto and aviation segment gross margin rates were relatively consistent
between fiscal periods.

Selling, general and administrative
expense increased 7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017
compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to legal-related costs
and information technology costs. As a percent of revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses in all segments except
marine were relatively consistent on a year over year basis. The increase in the marine segment, as a percent of revenues, was
primarily related to a litigation settlement.

Research and development
expense increased 9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of engineering personnel throughout
the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017. In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $43.7 million when compared
with the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, and increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue. Our research and development
spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.

As a result of the
above, operating income increased 7% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the
53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. The growth in operating income, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, was
primarily due to an increase in revenue growth and increase in gross margin percentage, which was partially offset by
increased operating expenses, as discussed above.

The average returns on
cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 and the 53-
weeks ended December 31, 2016 were 1.5% for both periods. Interest income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to slightly
higher yields on fixed-income securities, while other income decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net capital gains
realized in fiscal 2016.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation
to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency
of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions
and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss
is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the
functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the
Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $22.6 million currency
loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset
by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.4%
against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 14.1% against the Euro and 9.5%
against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency
gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $31.7 million currency
loss recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening
of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan
Dollar, resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British
Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million
is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.


Income Tax Provision

Our income tax benefit
for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 was $12.7 million compared to income tax expense of $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended
December 31, 2016, resulting in a net change of $131.6 million. Contributing to the decrease in tax expense was:

·

Income tax benefit of $180.0 million related
to the Company’s Switzerland corporate tax election in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 with no comparable item in the
53-weeks ended December 31, 2016,

Partially offset by:

·

Income tax expense of $19.9 million related
to share based compensation in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 in accordance with new accounting standard Topic 718, Compensation–Stock
Compensation, and

·

Increased income tax expense of $21.0
million related to the Company’s election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions in the 52-weeks ended December
30, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed by United States Congress, reducing the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35%
to 21%. The effects of U.S. tax reform, including revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, had an immaterial impact on
the 2017 income tax benefit, on a provisional basis, as discussed in Note 6.

Net Income

As a result of the various
factors noted above, net income increased 36% to $695.0 million for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to $510.8 million
for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.

Net sales increased 7% in 2016 when compared to the prior year period. All segments had an increase in
revenue except for auto. Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 29% in the 53-weeks ended December 31,
2016 compared to 38% in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Total unit sales increased
4% to 16.8 million units in 2016 from 16.2 million units in 2015.

Auto segment revenue decreased 17% from the prior year period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market
contraction. Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation revenues increased 33%, 24%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, when compared to the
prior year period, primarily due to increases in sales volumes. Growth in outdoor was driven by wearables and the newly acquired
DeLorme product lines. The increase in fitness was driven by wearables with Garmin Elevate

TM

wrist heart rate technology.
Our marine segment increased due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment systems. Aviation revenues increased
due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.

In the auto segment, the
cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline. In the outdoor and fitness segments, the increases
of 32% and 29% in cost of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth. In the marine and aviation segments,
the increases of 16% and 6%, respectively, primarily reflect volume growth.

The average returns on
cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 and the 52-weeks
ended December 26, 2015 were 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on
fixed-income securities.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation
to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency
of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions
and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss
is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the
functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the
Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $31.7 million currency
loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening of the
U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar,
resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British Pound
Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million
was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $23.5 million currency
loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially
offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar
strengthened 10.0% against the Euro and 4.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $31.2 million and $2.1
million, respectively. This was largely offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a
gain of $19.5 million. The remaining net currency loss of $9.7 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

During the 53-weeks ended
December 31, 2016, Garmin recorded other income of $4.0 million compared to $11.4 million in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
The decrease in fiscal 2016 relates primarily to a legal settlement received in fiscal 2015.


Income Tax Provision

Our income tax expense
increased by $7.9 million, to $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, from $111.0 million for the 52-weeks ended
December 26, 2015.  Contributing to the increase was:

·

Increased income before taxes in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016
compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015,

Partially offset by:

·

A net release of uncertain tax position
reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations of $11.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, as
compared with $7.3 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Net Income

As a result of the various
factors noted above, net income increased 12% to $510.8 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to $456.2 million
for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 30, 2017, we had $2,313.2 million
of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash
requirements will be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share
repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be
sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the
on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin
entity holding the cash. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of
liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and
investments during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately 1.6%, 1.5%, and 1.2%, respectively. The fair value of our securities
varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit
performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities.

The $44.8 million decrease
in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of cash
provided by working capital of $133.2 million (which included increases of $52.2 million in accounts receivable and $31.5 million
in cash paid for inventory) and income taxes payable of $16.5 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net

The $425.2 million increase
in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash
provided by working capital of $223.5 million (which included decreases of $122.5 million in cash paid for inventory and $109.6
million in cash paid for prepaid royalties and other assets) and income taxes payable of $154.0 million, primarily attributable
to cash taxes paid related to a 2015 intercompany restructuring. The increase was also impacted by an increase of net income of
$54.6 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $6.9 million.

$140 million to $150 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing
capital expenditures and maintenance activities. Approximately half of the budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are attributable
to Olathe, KS facilities, including the expansion project described in “Item 2. Properties.”

The $113.3 million decrease
in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to decreased dividend payments
of $98.5 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and a decrease of purchases of treasury
stock of $18.7 million under our share repurchase authorization.

The $61.6 million increase
in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased dividend payments
of $103.3 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and the year-over-year increase of
our dividend rate, partially offset by a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of $38.2 million under our share repurchase authorization.

Our declared dividend has
increased from $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the twelve calendar
quarters beginning in June 2015.

The Company is party to
certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, and other indirect purchases in
connection with conducting our business.  The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December
30, 2017 was approximately $313.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual
obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders
are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.

We may be required to make
significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows
associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement,
if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $130.8 million as of December 30, 2017,
have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits,
see Note 2, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk primarily
in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials
costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we
have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining
price reductions in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We do not believe that
inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become
subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our
inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange
Rate Risk

The operation of Garmin’s
subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant
foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically
hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The currencies that create
a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Garmin Corporation,
headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities
at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the effect of
the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and
investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. Dollars.

Most European subsidiaries
use the Euro as the functional currency. The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains
the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been
realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes that gains
and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.

During fiscal year 2017,
the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $22.6 million, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the
Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2017,
the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.4% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 14.1%
against the Euro and 9.5% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
The remaining net currency gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. These and other currency
moves during fiscal year 2017 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $88.3 million within accumulated other comprehensive
income.


We assessed the Company’s
exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and
the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than respective functional currencies as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse
changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before
income taxes of approximately $96 million and $92 million at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Interest Rate Risk

We have no outstanding
long-term debt as of December 30, 2017. We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are exposed to interest
rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses
associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.

The Company’s investment policy targets
low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company does not intend to sell
securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments
before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. During 2017 and 2016, the Company did not record any material
impairment charges on its outstanding securities.

We assessed the Company’s exposure to
interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to
the Company’s portfolio of marketable securities. Based on balance sheet positions as of December 30, 2017 and December 31,
2016, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted
in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $42 million and $45 million at December 30, 2017 and December 30, 2016,
respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd.
and Subsidiaries

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 30, 2017 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2018, expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

GARMIN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share
information)

December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016

1. Description of the Business

Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries
(together, the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based,
portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and
sensor-based products. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s
products to the Company’s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in the Americas region and for most of the Company’s research and new product development. GII also manufactures
most of the Company’s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing
of the Company’s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL’s sales are to other Company-owned
distributors in the EMEA region.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

At the Company’s
Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the cancellation of 10,000,000 registered shares
of the Company held by the Company (the “Formation Shares”) and the reduction in par value of each share of the Company
from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association to effect a corresponding share capital
reduction.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal
year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly
52 weeks in a calendar year, and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year)
in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain
fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.

In those resulting fiscal
years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the
financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to
the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters. Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 included 52 weeks
while fiscal 2016 included 53 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.


Foreign Currency

Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries
utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by the Foreign Currency
Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements
of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the
reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and
at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
equity. Cumulative currency translation adjustments of $78,909 and ($9,411) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively,
have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Transactions in foreign
currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British
Pound Sterling typically have offsetting impacts on operating income when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar
due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily
to revenue.

Assets and liabilities
resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The majority of the
Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities,
receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Foreign currency losses
recorded in results of operations were $22,579, $31,651, and $23,465 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016,
and December 26, 2015, respectively. The loss in fiscal 2017 was due primarily to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar,
which was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. The loss in fiscal 2016 was due primarily
to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. The loss
in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, which was partially offset
by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share
amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share,
the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive share-based compensation awards has been reduced by the
number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise or release at the average market price of the
Company’s stock during the period the awards were outstanding. See Note 10.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short
maturity of those instruments.

Trade Accounts Receivable

The Company sells its products
to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. 
Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition. The Company carries its
trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear
interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.


Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company grants credit
to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require
security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and typically have been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent
with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or
to the timing of new product releases by the Company.

The Company’s top
ten customers have contributed between 22% and 24% of net sales since 2015. None of the Company’s customers accounted for
more than or equal to 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015.

Inventories

Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company writes down its inventory
for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net
realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventories consisted of the following:

balances by major class of inventory as of December 31, 2016 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment
are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings and improvements

39-50

Office furniture and equipment

3-5

Manufacturing and engineering equipment

5-10

Vehicles


Long-Lived Assets

As required by the

Property,
Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset
is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.


The

Intangibles –
Goodwill and Other

topic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 350) requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth
quarter of each year. ASC Topic 350 allows management to first perform a qualitative assessment (“step zero”) by assessing
the qualitative factors of relevant events and circumstances at the reporting unit level to determine if it is necessary to perform
the quantitative goodwill impairment test (“step one”). If factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the step one assessment will be performed. If the fair
value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount in step one then goodwill impairment will be recognized and the charge
is determined through the “step two” analysis.

Each of the Company’s
operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness) represents a distinct reporting unit. The auto
PND market has declined in recent years as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred. This has resulted
in periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company’s auto PND reporting unit. Considering these qualitative factors,
management performed a step one quantitative goodwill impairment assessment of the auto PND reporting unit in the fourth quarter
of 2017. Management determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount, and
a step two analysis was therefore not performed. However, considering the uncertainty of future operating results and/or market
conditions deteriorating faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in management’s estimation of fair value,
management believes some or all of the approximately $80 million of goodwill associated with the Company’s auto PND reporting
unit is at risk of future impairment. Management concluded that no other reporting units are currently at risk of impairment.

The Company did not recognize
any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2017, 2016, or 2015.

Accounting
guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from three
to ten years

.

Dividends

Under Swiss corporate law,
dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company’s shareholders.

On June 9, 2017, the shareholders
approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.53 was paid in the Company’s 2017 fiscal year) payable in four equal

As of December 30, 2017
and December 31, 2016, approximately $304,674 of retained earnings was indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders
pursuant to the laws of Taiwan.

Intangible Assets

At December 30, 2017, and
December 31, 2016, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets
recorded at a cost of $316,705 and $253,473, respectively. Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization was $193,886 and $173,023 at
December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $20,863, $14,319, and
$7,115 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively. In the next five years, the
amortization expense is estimated to be $18,796, $16,293, $14,167, $10,463, and $8,111, respectively.

The Company’s excess
purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $286,982 at December 30, 2017, and $224,553 at December 31,

Marketable Securities

Management determines the
appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date.

All of the Company’s
marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 30, 2017. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). At December 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, cumulative unrealized net losses of $22,864 and $27,350, respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of related taxes.

Investments are reviewed
periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary. If investments
are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.

Testing for impairment
of investments requires significant management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination
of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements. The
discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments
are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.

The amortized cost of debt
securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or
in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest income
from investments. Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other
income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Investments are discussed
in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for
income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

. The liability method provides
that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company accounts for
uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

.  The Company recognizes liabilities
based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately
proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the
Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.

Income taxes are discussed
in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable.  For the large majority of the Company’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped
and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products
and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone
sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 
The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.


For multiple-element arrangements that include
tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements
that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their
relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price
to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE),
(ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).  VSOE generally
exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow
range.  In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications,
in-dash navigation solutions, incremental navigation and/or communication service subscriptions, aviation subscriptions and extended
warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are individually immaterial.

The Company offers PNDs
with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.  LMUs enable customers to download the latest map
and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.  In addition, the Company offers PNDs with traffic service
bundled in the original purchase price.  The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving
the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.  The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software
essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.  The remaining deliverables are the LMU
and/or traffic service.  The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. 
Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the
other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU
and/or the traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the products.

The Company has determined
sufficient VSOE does not exist for LMU or traffic, and that third party evidence of selling price is not available as stand-alone
and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis. Therefore, the Company uses the royalty cost plus a normal
margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative selling prices of the LMU and traffic elements.

For multiple-element software
arrangements that do not include a tangible product, the Company allocates revenue to the various elements based on VSOE. When
VSOE cannot be established for undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until the earlier point at which all elements of the
arrangement are delivered or sufficient VSOE does exist, unless the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support.
If the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support, the entire arrangement consideration is recognized ratably over
the support period. The Company offers navigation software licenses to certain customers, bundled with map updates to be provided
periodically over the support period. The Company has determined sufficient VSOE of similar map updates does not exist for certain
arrangements, and therefore revenue from these transactions is recognized ratably over the contractual map update period.

The Company records revenue
net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.  The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer
sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to
assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based
incentives.  The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of
future conditions.  Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company’s operating results.  
These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for
on a percentage of sales basis.   If market conditions were to decline, the Company may take actions to increase customer
incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.


Deferred Revenues and Costs

At December 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $303,521 and $286,971, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling
$122,162 and $103,546, respectively.

The deferred revenues and
costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives, typically one to five years, on a straight-line basis. In the next five
years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $91,370,
$48,627, $25,340, $11,208, and $4,814, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Product Warranty

The Company provides for
estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally
provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged
or defective.  The Company’s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled
within 5 months from time of sale.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period
of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation and auto OEM products have a warranty period of two years or more
from the date of installation

.

The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based
on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.  To the
extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its
warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit. The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes
in the aggregate warranty accrual:

Sales Programs

The Company provides certain
monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and
growth. Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products. Estimated rebates and incentives
payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis. In addition, the
Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their
inventories in advance of new product releases. Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers
who have purchased the product, or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis. These rebates, incentives,
and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company
has sold the product.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising
costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $164,693, $177,143, and $167,166 for the years ended December
30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.

Research and Development

A
majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which
are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $511,634, $467,960, and $427,043 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December
31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.

Customer Service
and Technical Support

Customer
service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering
customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance
to customers. The technical support is typically provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. The related
cost of providing this free support is not material.

Software Development Costs

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Software

requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has
been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Capitalized
software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short. As required
by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release
of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.


Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently sponsors four stock-based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled

Compensation –
Stock Compensation

requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made
to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values.

Accounting guidance requires
companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite
service period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As stock-based compensation
expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they
have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based
on historical experience and management’s estimates.

In March 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which is intended to simplify
the accounting for share-based payment awards. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the quarter ended
April 1, 2017. ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation to be recognized in the income
tax provision. We previously recorded these amounts to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax
benefits and deficiencies are not estimated in the effective tax rate, rather, are recorded as discrete tax items in the period
they occur. Excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations
under ASU 2016-09, rather than as a cash flow from financing activities. The most significant impact of ASU 2016-09 during the
fiscal year ending December 30, 2017 was the recognition of income tax expense of $22,620 resulting from stock options and stock
appreciation rights expiring unexercised in the second and fourth quarters.

Stock compensation plans
are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”),
which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. The FASB has issued several standards amending or relating to ASU 2014-09
(collectively, the “new revenue standard”). The effective date of ASU 2014-09 is for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company has adopted the new revenue standard in the first quarter
of the Company’s fiscal year ending December 29, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which will require the Company
to restate each prior reporting period presented in future financial statement issuances.

The Company has evaluated
Topic 606, and has assessed existing and historical contracts to identify possible differences in the timing of revenue recognition
under the new revenue standard. During this evaluation, both senior management and the Audit Committee have been updated as to
progress and findings on a frequent basis. Based on our evaluation of the new revenue standard, our recognition will be consistent
with our historical accounting policies except for certain arrangements within the Company’s auto segment.


A portion of the Company’s
auto segment contracts have historically been accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 985-605 Software-Revenue
Recognition (Topic 985-605). Under Topic 985-605, the Company deferred revenue and associated costs of all elements of multiple-element
software arrangements if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) could not be established for an undelivered element
(e.g. map updates). In applying the new revenue standard to certain contracts that include both software licenses and map updates,
we will recognize the portion of revenue and costs related to the software license at the time of delivery rather than ratably
over the map update period.

Additionally, for certain
multiple-element arrangements within the Company’s auto segment, the Company’s policy has been to allocate consideration
to traffic services and recognize the revenue and associated cost of royalties ratably over the estimated life of the underlying
product. Under the new revenue standard, we will recognize revenue and associated costs of royalties related to certain traffic
services at the time of hardware and/or software delivery. Specifically, the new revenue standard emphasize the timing of the
Company’s performance, and upon delivery of the navigation device and/or software, the Company has performed its obligation
with respect to the design and production of the product to receive and interpret the broadcast traffic signal for the benefit
of the end user.

The changes in accounting
policy described above collectively result in reductions to deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) balances, and
accelerate the recognition of revenues and deferred costs in the auto segment going forward. Summarized financial information depicting
the impact of the new revenue standard follows:

(1) Effective for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2018, we have
adopted ASC Topic 606. The balances above are restated under ASC Topic 606.

The Company’s historical
net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities are not impacted by adoption of the new revenue
standard.


Financial Instruments – Recognition,
Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure

In January 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2018, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which sets out the principles for
the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees
to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged
compared to the current accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”), which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and
payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing
diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company will adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and it is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position of results of operations.

Income Taxes

In October 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory
(“ASU 2016-16”), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset
other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018,
and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

In March 2017, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Topic 310-20): Premium
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities (“ASU 2017-08”), which shortens the amortization period for certain
callable debt securities held at a premium, requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. Callable debt securities
held at a discount continue to be amortized to maturity. ASU 2017-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive
Income

In February 2018, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification
of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows for stranded tax effects
in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to be reclassified to retained earnings.
ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard and expects to early adopt the new standard
effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.


3. Marketable Securities

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The accounting
guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liability

Level 2

Observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability

Level 3

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

The Company endeavors to
utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation is based on prices obtained from
an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices
for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual
cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.

The method described above
may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore,
while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value
measurement at the reporting date.

Available-for-sale securities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

The Company’s investment
policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The fair value of our
securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in
the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have
an unrealized loss shown in the table above, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security
before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.

The Company recognizes
the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in "Other Income" and the noncredit component
in "Other comprehensive income (loss)" for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more
likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.  During 2017 and 2016, the Company did not record any material
impairment charges on its outstanding securities.

The amortized cost and
fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 30, 2017 were $1,348,777 and $1,323,807 respectively. Approximately
80% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 30, 2017. We have the ability to hold these
securities until maturity or their value is recovered. We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit
losses because there has been no material deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore,
no material impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.

The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.


The following tables display
additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities
in an unrealized loss position as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

4. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Rental expense related
to office, equipment, warehouse space, and real estate amounted to $18,915, $19,657, and $18,104 for the years ended December 30,
2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively. The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.

Certain cash balances,
primarily of GEL and GC, are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.  The total
amount of restricted cash balances were $271 and $113 at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

The Company is party to
certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, and other indirect purchases in connection
with conducting our business. The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 30, 2017 was approximately
$313,385. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase
orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs
and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time.

Contingencies

In the normal course of
business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters
alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly and annual basis, developments
in legal proceedings, investigations, claims, and other loss contingencies that could affect any required accrual or disclosure
or estimate of reasonably possible loss or range of loss. An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income
if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount
within that range, then that amount is accrued. If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other
amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range.

If an outcome unfavorable
to the Company is determined to be probable, but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated or is determined to be reasonably
possible, but not probable, we disclose the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or
a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company’s aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1)
matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability,
and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, and a liability therefore has not been accrued.
This aggregate range only represents the Company’s estimate of reasonably possible losses and does not represent the Company’s
maximum loss exposure. The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range
of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. In assessing the probability of an outcome
in a lawsuit, claim or assessment that could be unfavorable to the Company, we consider the following factors, among others: a)
the nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment; b) the progress of the case; c) the opinions or views of legal counsel and
other advisers; d) our experience in similar cases; e) the experience of other entities in similar cases; and f) how we intend
to respond to the lawsuit, claim, or assessment. Costs incurred in defending lawsuits, claims or assessments are expensed as incurred.


Management of the Company
currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in
excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.
The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse resolution
of one or more of such matters in excess of management’s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular
quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is
likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 24, 2018,
Garmin and Navico agreed on a global settlement of all pending litigation between them, pursuant to which it is expected that all
related claims will be dismissed with prejudice or terminated, including those for which the Company had previously disclosed a
reasonably possible loss. The settlement is not material to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The
parties have agreed to keep the terms of the settlement confidential. The Company also settled or resolved certain other matters
during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s
business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

5. Employee Benefit Plans

GII and the Company’s
other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute
up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute
a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
During the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, expense related to these and other defined
contribution plans of $43,826, $40,844, and $37,489, respectively, was charged to operations.

Certain of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider
final pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and
December 26, 2015 were significant.

In

the

year ended December 30, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit
of $180,034 as a result of the Company’s February 2017 election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with
evolving international tax initiatives.

The Company’s statutory
federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the Redomestication, effective June 27, 2010,
is 7.83%. If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for
2017 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $186,000 lower, or $53,600, and
the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $77,000. For 2016, the amounts related
to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $171,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be
adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $55,000. For 2015, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately
$154,000 lower, or $44,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $52,000. All
other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.


The Company’s income
before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $461,436, $453,729, and $403,242, for the years ended December 30,
2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.

Income taxes of $20,287,
$22,139, and $21,085 at December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively, have not been accrued by the
Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested
in the subsidiaries indefinitely.

Deferred income taxes reflect
the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities
are as follows:

At December 30, 2017, the
Company had $8,413 of tax credit carryover compared to $5,012 at December 31, 2016.

At December 30, 2017, the
Company had a deferred tax asset of $8,799 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $70,419.
Included in the NOL carryforwards is $43,210 that relates to Switzerland and expires in varying amounts between 2023 and 2024,
$1,757 that relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between 2025 and 2027, $10,610 that relates to the United States
and various state jurisdictions and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2037, $5,234 that relates to the Netherlands and
expires in 2026 and $9,608 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date. The Company has recorded a valuation
allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than
not to be realized. In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize
more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination
is made.


On December 22, 2017, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law in the United States. The new tax legislation contains several provisions that will
impact the Company, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, acceleration of business asset expensing,
and a reduction in the amount of executive pay that may qualify as a tax deduction, among others. The decrease in the corporate
income tax rate will require the Company to remeasure its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as reassess the realizability
of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. FASB ASC 740 requires the recognition of the effects of tax law changes in the period
of enactment. However, due to the complexities of the new tax legislation, the SEC has issued SAB 118 which allows for the recognition
of provisional amounts during a measurement period similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations.
The Company has recorded a provisional re-measurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in an immaterial impact
on its 2017 income tax provision. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the new tax legislation, as well as any related
future regulations and rules, and will record any additional impacts as identified during the measurement period, if necessary.
The Company does not expect any such potential adjustments in the future periods will materially impact the Company’s financial
condition or result of operations.

The total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2017 was $130,798. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized
tax benefits for years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 is as follows:

Accounting guidance
requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as noncurrent liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid
within one year of the balance sheet date. The entire balance of net unrecognized benefits of $127,306, $109,667 and $93,654 are
required to be classified as noncurrent at December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively. The net unrecognized
tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty
in the timing of deductibility.

Interest and penalties,
if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense. At December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016,
and December 26, 2015, the Company had accrued approximately $5,605, $3,901, and $2,479, respectively, for interest. The interest
component of the reserve increased income tax expense for the years ending December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26,
2015, by $1,704, $1,422, and $320 respectively. The Company did not have significant amounts accrued for penalties for the years
ending December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015.

The Company files income tax returns in
Switzerland, U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In its major tax jurisdictions,
Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and U.S. federal and various states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations
by tax authorities, with few exceptions, for years prior to 2013, 2012, 2015, and 2014, respectively.


The Company recognized
a reduction of income tax expense of $17,918, $11,151, and $6,971 in fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and
December 26, 2015, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various
jurisdictions.

The Company believes that
it is reasonably possible that approximately $20,000 to $25,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease
within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations. This potential decrease in unrecognized tax
benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.

7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As required by the

Financial Instruments

topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain
financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments are held
or issued for trading purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

For certain of the
Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities,
the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

8. Segment Information

The Company has identified
five reportable segments for external reporting purposes – auto, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness. There are two operating
segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment. Each operating
segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses
performance of each segment individually.

All of the Company’s
reportable segments offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through
OEMs. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary. The Company’s marine,
auto, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to
retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s aviation
products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily
to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The Company’s Chief
Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM. The CODM uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss to assess segment
performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses, including
certain allocated general and administrative costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The Company’s
reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business. Thus, the Company
does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment
to the CODM.


Revenues, gross profit,
and operating income for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented below. In 2016 the Company moved action
camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other
camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment. The overall impact of the move was immaterial. However, action camera related
operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation.

9. Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The various Company stock
compensation plans are summarized below. For all stock compensation plans, the company’s policy is to issue treasury shares
for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)
purchases.

2011 Non-employee Directors’ Equity
Incentive Plan

In June 2011, the stockholders
adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the “2011 Directors Plan”) providing for grants of stock
options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance. The term of
each award cannot exceed ten years. Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, 10,432, 12,984, and
12,008 RSUs were granted under this plan.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan

In June 2005, the shareholders
adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options,
SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common
shares were available for issuance. In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional 3,000,000 shares to the plan, making the total
shares authorized under the plan 13,000,000. Option and SAR grants vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined
by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
RSUs granted prior to December 10, 2012 vested evenly over a period of five years, while RSUs granted on and after that date vested
or are vesting evenly over a period of three years. In addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU
grants is also contingent upon the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance goals. During 2017, 2016, and 2015,
1,044,045, 1,228,427, and 1,171,905 RSUs were granted under the 2005 Plan. No SARs were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2017, 2016,
and 2015.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan

In October 2000, the shareholders
adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options,
SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common
shares were available for issuance. The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined
by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2017, 2016, or 2015.

2000 Non-employee Directors’ Option
Plan

Also in October 2000, the
stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “2000 Directors Plan”) providing for grants
of options for up to 100,000 common shares. In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making
the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over a three-year
period. Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares
under this plan.


Stock-Based Compensation Activity

A summary of the Company’s
stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000
Directors Plan for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 is provided below:

The weighted-average remaining

The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 30, 2017 was 1.29 years.

The total fair value of
awards vested during 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $30,280, $22,429, and $23,351, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of options
and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 30, 2017 were $4,209 and $3,994, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values
of options and SARs exercised during 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3,742, $1,632, and $3,714, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic
value of RSUs outstanding at December 30, 2017 was $122,885. The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2017, 2016,
and 2015 were $45,424, $27,386, and $20,787, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable
number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company’s closing stock price on
the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards
multiplied by the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. The Company’s
closing stock price was $59.57 on December 30, 2017. As of December 30, 2017, there was $65,166 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The shareholders have adopted
an ESPP. Up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP, including 2,000,000 shares approved by shareholders
in June 2015. Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on
the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an
“employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, 489,267,
541,018, 488,753 shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $20,996, $18,157, and $16,789,
respectively. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, the purchases were issued from treasury shares. At December 30, 2017, approximately
970,366 shares were available for future issuance.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a) Conclusion Regarding
the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b) Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013 framework).

Based on such assessment
and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
30, 2017.

Ernst & Young LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an
attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
30, 2017, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.


(c) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

We have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’
internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd.
and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017, and the related
notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”)
of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
