PART I

Item 1.     Business.

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. (referred to herein as "TRICON" or the
"Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in 1997. The
principal executive offices of TRICON are located at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville,
Kentucky 40213, and its telephone number at that location is (502) 874-8300.

TRICON, the registrant, together with its restaurant operating companies
and other subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report ("Form 10-K") as
the Company. Prior to October 6, 1997, the business of the Company was conducted by
PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") through various subsidiaries and divisions.

This Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary
Statements on page 36.

General Development of Business

In January 1997, PepsiCo announced its
decision to spin-off its restaurant businesses to shareholders as an independent public
company (the "Spin-off"). Effective as of October 6, 1997, PepsiCo disposed of its
restaurant businesses by distributing all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
TRICON to its shareholders. TRICON's Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on October 7, 1997 under the symbol "YUM." (Prior to that date, from September
17, 1997 through October 6, 1997, TRICON's Common Stock was traded on the New York Stock
Exchange on a "when-issued" basis). As used in this Form 10-K, references to TRICON or
the Company include the historical operating results of the businesses and operations
transferred to the Company in the Spin-off. Additionally, throughout this Form 10-K, the
terms "restaurants," "stores" and "units" are used interchangeably.

Financial Information about Operating Segments

TRICON consists of four operating segments: KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
TRICON Restaurants International ("TRI" or "International"). For financial reporting
purposes, management considers the three U.S. operating segments to be similar and,
therefore, has aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment. Operating
segment information for the years ended December 29, 2001, December 30, 2000, and
December 25, 1999 is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") in Part II, Item 7, pages 17 through 36 and
in the related Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages
37 through 73.

Narrative Description of Business

General

TRICON is the world's largest quick service restaurant ("QSR") company
based on number of system units, with more than 30,000 units in over 100 countries and
territories. The TRICON organization is currently made up of four operating companies
organized around its three core concepts: KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (the "Concepts").
The four operating companies are KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and TRI.

Restaurant Concepts

Through its three widely-recognized Concepts, the Company develops,
operates, franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare,
package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items. These restaurants are
operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise or license agreements, by
franchisees or licensees who are independent third parties, or by international
affiliates in which we own a non-controlling equity interest ("Unconsolidated
Affiliates").


In each Concept, consumers can dine in and/or carry out food. In
addition, Taco Bell and KFC offer a drive-thru option in many stores. Pizza Hut offers a
drive-thru option on a much more limited basis. Pizza Hut and, on a much more limited
basis, KFC offer delivery service.

Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of
food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to
provide appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices.

The franchise program of the Company is designed to assure consistency
and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises. Under the standard
franchise agreement, franchisees supply capital - initially by paying a franchise fee to
TRICON, purchasing or leasing the land and building and purchasing equipment, signs,
seating, inventories and supplies, and over the longer term, by reinvesting in the
business. Franchisees then contribute to the Company's revenues through the payment of
royalties based on a percentage of sales.

The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open
relationships with its franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company
invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their
representative organizations on all aspects of the business, including new products, new
equipment and new management techniques.

The Company is actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding, where two
or more of its Concepts are operated in a single restaurant unit. In addition, the
Company is testing multibranding options involving one of its Concepts and a restaurant
concept not owned by or affiliated with TRICON. By combining two or more restaurant
concepts in one location, particularly those that have complementary daypart strengths,
the Company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units, significantly
improve returns on per unit investment, and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater
number of trade areas throughout the U.S. and internationally. Through the consolidation
of market planning initiatives across all three of its Concepts, the Company has
established multi-year development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company
penetration of all three Concepts and to improve returns on its existing asset base. The
development of multibranded units may be limited, in some instances, by prior development
and/or territory rights granted to franchisees.

At year-end 2001, there were 1,520 multibranded units in the worldwide
system. These units were comprised of 1,394 units offering food products from two of the
Concepts (a "2n1"), 45 units offering food products from each of the Concepts (a "3n1")
and 81 units offering food products from one of the Concepts and a restaurant concept not
owned by or affiliated with TRICON.

Restaurant Operations

Through its Concepts, TRICON develops, operates, franchises and licenses
a system of both traditional and non-traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units
feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery services.
Non-traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and
kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like
airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and
colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.

The Company's restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit
size. Generally, each Company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager ("RGM"),
together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and
sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant usually has between 10 and 35 hourly
employees, most of whom work part-time. The Company's four operating companies each issue
detailed manuals covering all aspects of their respective operations, including food
handling and product preparation procedures, safety and quality issues, equipment
maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. The restaurant
management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit and for
ensuring compliance with operating standards. CHAMPS - which stands for Cleanliness,
Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance, Product Quality and Speed of Service - is our core
systemwide program for training, measuring and rewarding employee performance against key
customer measures. CHAMPS is intended to align the operating processes of our entire
system around one set of standards. RGMs' efforts, including


CHAMPS performance measures, are monitored by area managers or market
coaches. Market coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants. The
Company's restaurants are visited from time to time by various senior operators to help
ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant team members.

RGMs attend and complete their respective operating company's required
training programs. These programs consist of initial training, as well as additional
continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to
time. Initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize
leadership, business management, supervisory skills (including training, coaching, and
recruiting), product preparation and production, safety, quality control, customer
service, labor management, and equipment maintenance.

Following is a brief description of each Concept:

KFC

KFC was founded in Corbin,  Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders,  an early developer of the quick service food business and
     a pioneer of the restaurant  franchise  concept.  The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried
     Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952.  KFC is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

As of year-end 2001, KFC was the leader in the U.S.  chicken QSR segment among  companies  featuring  chicken as their primary
     product offering, with a 46 percent market share in that segment which is over 4 times that of its closest national competitor.

KFC operates in 85 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2001,  KFC had 5,399 units in the U.S.,
     and 6,416 units in 84 countries and  territories  outside the U.S.  Approximately  24 percent of the U.S.  units and 21 percent of
     the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

While product offerings vary throughout the worldwide system,  all KFC restaurants offer fried  chicken-on-the-bone  products,
     primarily  marketed  under the names  Original  Recipe and Extra Tasty  Crispy.  Other  principal  entree  items  include  chicken
     sandwiches  (including the Twister),  Colonel's  Crispy Strips,  and,  seasonally,  Chunky Chicken Pot Pies. KFC restaurants  also
     offer a variety of side items,  such as biscuits,  mashed  potatoes and gravy,  coleslaw,  corn,  Potato  Wedges (in the U.S.) and
     french fries  (outside of the U.S.),  as well as desserts.  Restaurant  decor is  characterized  by the image of the Colonel,  and
     KFC's distinctive packaging includes the "Bucket" of chicken.

Pizza Hut

The first  Pizza Hut  restaurant  was opened in 1958 in  Wichita,  Kansas,  and within a year,  the first  franchise  unit was
     opened.  Today,  Pizza Hut is the largest  restaurant chain in the world  specializing in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products.
     Pizza Hut is based in Dallas, Texas.

As of  year-end  2001,  Pizza Hut was the  leader in the U.S.  pizza  QSR  segment,  with a 15  percent  market  share in that
     segment.

Pizza Hut operates in 87 countries and  territories  throughout the world.  As of year-end 2001,  Pizza Hut had 7,719 units in
     the U.S.,  and 4,272 units outside of the U.S.  Approximately  23 percent of the U.S.  units and 18 percent of the non-U.S.  units
     are operated by the Company.

Pizza Hut  features a variety of pizzas,  which may include  Twisted  Crust,  The Big New Yorker,  Pan Pizza,  Thin 'n Crispy,
     Stuffed Crust, Hand Tossed,  Sicilian and The Insider.  Each of these pizzas are offered with a variety of different toppings.  In
     some  restaurants,  Pizza Hut also offers  breadsticks,  pasta,  salads and sandwiches.  The distinctive Pizza Hut image typically
     features a bright red roof.


Taco Bell

The first  Taco Bell  restaurant  was  opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in  Downey,  California,  and in 1964,  the first Taco Bell
     franchise was sold.  Taco Bell is based in Irvine, California.

As of  year-end  2001,  Taco Bell was the leader in the U.S.  Mexican  QSR  segment,  with a 64 percent  market  share in that
     segment.

Taco Bell operates in 14 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2001,  there were 6,444 Taco Bell
     units  within the U.S.,  and 239 units  outside  of the U.S.  Approximately  20  percent  of the U.S.  units and 16 percent of the
     non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

Taco Bell  specializes in  Mexican-style  food  products,  including  various types of tacos,  burritos,  Gorditas,  Chalupas,
     Grilled Stuft Burritos,  quesadillas,  salads,  nachos and other related items. Taco Bell units feature a distinctive bell logo on
     their signage.

International

The international operations of the three TRICON Concepts are
consolidated into a separate operating company, which has directed its focus toward
franchise system growth and concentration of Company development in those markets in
which the Company believes sufficient scale is achievable. TRI has developed global
systems and tools designed to improve marketing, operations consistency, product
delivery, market planning and development and franchise support capability. TRI is based
in Dallas, Texas.

As of year-end 2001, TRI had 10,927 units. Approximately 20 percent of
these units are operated by the Company. In 2001, TRI accounted for 35 percent of the
Company's total system sales and 31 percent of the Company's revenues.

Operating Structure

In all three of its Concepts, the Company either operates units or they
are operated by independent franchisees or licensees. Franchisees can range in size from
individuals owning just a few units to large publicly traded companies. In addition, the
Company owns non-controlling interests in Unconsolidated Affiliates who operate similar
to franchisees. As of year-end 2001, approximately 21 percent of TRICON's worldwide units
were operated by the Company, approximately 63 percent by franchisees, approximately 9
percent by licensees and approximately 7 percent by Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Refranchising

Since 1995, the Company has been rebalancing the system toward more
franchisee ownership to focus its resources on what it believes are high growth potential
markets where it can more efficiently leverage its scale. Since the strategy began, the
Company has refranchised 6,128 units: 233 units in 2001, 757 units in 2000, 1,435 units
in 1999, 1,373 units in 1998, 1,407 units in 1997, 659 units in 1996 and 264 units in
1995. As a result of the Company's refranchising activity, coupled with new points of
distribution added by franchisees and licensees and the program to upgrade the asset
portfolio by closing underperforming stores, the Company's overall ownership of total
system units declined 26 percentage points in seven years from 47 percent at year-end
1994 to 21 percent at year-end 2001. The refranchising program was substantially
completed in 2001. In the future, the Company may sell additional stores to, or purchase
stores from, franchise or license operators as it deems appropriate.


Supply and Distribution

The Company is a substantial purchaser of a number of food and paper
products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. In 1996, to ensure reliable sources,
the Company consolidated most of its worldwide food and supply procurement activities
under an internal organization called Supply Chain Management, which sources, negotiates
contracts and buys specified food and supplies from hundreds of suppliers in a
significant number of countries and territories. Supply Chain Management monitors market
trends and seeks to identify and capitalize on purchasing opportunities that will enhance
the Company's competitive position. The principal products purchased include beef,
cheese, chicken products, cooking oils, corn, flour, lettuce, paper and packaging
materials, pinto beans, pork, seasonings, certain beverage products and tomato products.

Effective as of March 1, 1999, the Company, along with the KFC National
Purchasing Cooperative, Inc. and representatives of the Company's KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell franchisee groups, formed the Unified FoodService Purchasing Co-op, LLC (the
"Unified Co-op") for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment
in the U.S. The core mission of the Unified Co-op is to provide the lowest possible
sustainable store-delivered prices for restaurant products and equipment. This
arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company and franchisee restaurants in
the U.S., which the Company believes will further leverage the system's scale to drive
cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function. In 2001, purchasing volume for
the Unified Co-op was approximately $3.8 billion, making it the largest purchasing
cooperative of its kind in the QSR industry. The Company also believes that the Unified
Co-op has resulted (and should continue to result) in closer alignment of interests and a
stronger relationship with its franchisee community.

To ensure the wholesomeness of all food products, suppliers are required
to meet or exceed strict quality control standards. Long-term contracts and long-term
vendor relationships are used to ensure availability of products. The Company has not
experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for
most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for these supplies may be
subject to fluctuation. When prices increase, the Company may be able to pass on such
increases to its customers, although there is no assurance this can be done in the future.

Historically, many food products, paper and packaging supplies, and
equipment used in the operation of the Company's restaurants were distributed to
individual Company units by PepsiCo Food Services ("PFS"), which was PepsiCo's restaurant
distribution operation prior to its sale by PepsiCo in 1997 as described below. PFS also
sold and distributed these same items to many franchisees and licensees that operated in
the three restaurant systems, though principally to Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
franchised/licensed units in the U.S. In May 1997, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell entered
into a five-year Sales and Distribution Agreement with PFS to distribute the majority of
their food and supplies for Company stores, subject to PFS maintaining certain
performance levels. The Sales and Distribution Agreement became effective upon the
closing of the sale by PepsiCo of the distribution business of PFS to AmeriServe Food
Distribution, Inc. ("AmeriServe"), a subsidiary of Holberg Industries, Inc., pursuant to
a definitive agreement dated as of May 23, 1997, as amended.

Effective as of November 1, 1998, TRICON, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
entered into an amended and restated Sales and Distribution Agreement with AmeriServe
(the "Amended AmeriServe Agreement") which provided for a two and one-half year extension
of the term of the original agreement with PFS through January 2005, as well as an
additional two and one-half year renewal option that could extend the contract, based on
market rates, through July 2007. The Amended AmeriServe Agreement substantially modified
the way in which distribution fees are calculated, and included incentives for utilizing
more efficient distribution practices by both parties. Under the terms of the Amended
AmeriServe Agreement, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Company restaurants in the U.S. could
generally not use alternative distributors.

On January 31, 2000, AmeriServe filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization for AmeriServe (the "POR") was
approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on November 28, 2000. The POR provided for the sale
of the AmeriServe U.S. distribution business to McLane Company, Inc. ("McLane"), a


subsidiary of Wal-Mart, effective on November 30, 2000. In connection with this sale, the
Company agreed to certain amendments to the Amended AmeriServe Agreement, including an
extension of the Amended AmeriServe Agreement through October 31, 2010. Beginning on
November 30, 2000, McLane assumed all supply and distribution responsibilities under the
Amended AmeriServe Agreement, as well as under distribution agreements covering a
substantial portion of the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchise system, and, to a lesser
extent, the KFC franchise system.

A discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy on the Company is
contained in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 68.

TRICON, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and TRI have also entered into
multi-year agreements with Pepsi-Cola Company regarding the sale of Pepsi-Cola beverage
products at Company stores.

Trademarks and Patents

The Company has numerous registered trademarks and service marks. The
Company believes that many of these marks, including its Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®,
Pizza Hut® and Taco Bell® trademarks, have significant value and are materially important
to its business. The Company's policy is to pursue registration of its important
trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its trademarks.
The use of the Company's trademarks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in
KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchise and license agreements. Under current law and with
proper use, the Company's rights in its trademarks can generally last indefinitely. The
Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while valuable, are not
material to its business.

Working Capital

Information about the Company's working capital is included in MD&A in
Part II, Item 7, pages 17 through 36 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in
Part II, Item 8, pages 37 through 73.

Customers

The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer or small
group of customers.

Seasonal Operations

The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any
material degree.

Backlog Orders

Company restaurants have no backlog orders.

Government Contracts

No material portion of the Company's business is subject to renegotiation
of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S.
government.

Competition

The overall food service industry and the QSR segment are intensely
competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, restaurant
location and concept. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer
tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations;
demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing
restaurants; and disposable purchasing power. The Company competes within each market
with national and regional chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for
customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and
qualified franchisees.


Research and Development ("R&D")

The Company operates R&D facilities in Louisville, Kentucky; Dallas,
Texas; and Irvine, California. The Company expensed $28 million in 2001 and $24 million
in both 2000 and 1999 for R&D activities. From time to time, independent suppliers also
conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the TRICON restaurant
system.

Environmental Matters

The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental
laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position, or
result in material capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot predict the effect
on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During
2001, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no such material expenditures are anticipated.

Government Regulation

U.S.

The Company is subject to various  federal,  state and local laws affecting its business.  Each of the Company's  restaurants must
comply with  licensing and  regulation by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which include  health,  sanitation,  safety and fire
agencies in the state or  municipality in which the restaurant is located.  In addition,  each of the TRICON  operating  companies must
comply with various state laws that regulate the  franchisor/franchisee  relationship.  To date, the Company has not been significantly
affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

A small portion of Pizza Hut's net sales is attributable to the sale of
beer and wine. A license is required in most cases for each site that sells alcoholic
beverages (in most cases, on an annual basis) and licenses may be revoked or suspended
for cause at any time. Regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages relate to
many aspects of restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and
employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and
handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

The Company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such
matters as employment and pay practices, overtime, tip credits and working conditions.
The bulk of the Company's employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the
federal minimum wage.

The Company is also subject to federal and state child labor laws which,
among other things, prohibit the use of certain "hazardous equipment" by employees 18
years of age or younger. The Company has not to date been materially adversely affected
by such laws.

The Company continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") in order to conform to its requirements. Under
the ADA, the Company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to
better provide service to, or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of,
disabled persons. We believe that expenditures, if required, would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's operations.

International.

Internationally,  the Company's  restaurants are subject to national and local laws and  regulations  which are similar
to those affecting the Company's U.S.  restaurants,  including laws and regulations  concerning labor,  health,  sanitation and safety.
The  international  restaurants are also subject to tariffs and  regulations on imported  commodities and equipment and laws regulating
foreign  investment.  International  compliance with environmental  requirements has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.


Employees

As of year-end 2001, the Company employed approximately 210,000 persons,
over 65 percent of whom were part-time employees. Over 55 percent of the Company's
employees are employed in the U.S. The Company believes that it provides working
conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of its principal
competitors. Most Company employees are paid on an hourly basis. The Company's non-U.S.
employees are subject to numerous labor council relationships that vary due to the
diverse cultures in which the Company operates. The Company considers its employee
relations to be good.

Financial Information about International and U.S. Operations

Financial information about International and U.S. markets is
incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data in Part II, Item 6, page
16; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
("MD&A") in Part II, Item 7, pages 17 through 36; and in the related Consolidated
Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 37 through 73.

Item 2.     Properties.

As of year-end 2001, TRICON Concepts owned over 1,600 units and leased
over 2,600 units in the U.S.; and TRI owned approximately 400 units and leased
almost 1,800 units outside the U.S. Company restaurants in the U.S. which are not
owned are generally leased for initial terms of 15 or 20 years and generally have renewal
options; however, Pizza Hut delivery/carryout units in the U.S. generally are leased for
significantly shorter initial terms with short renewal options. Pizza Hut leases its and
TRI's corporate headquarters and research facility in Dallas, Texas. Taco Bell leases its
corporate headquarters in Irvine, California and KFC owns its and TRICON's corporate
headquarters and a research facility in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition, TRICON leases
office facilities for accounting services in both Louisville, Kentucky, and Albuquerque,
New Mexico. Additional information about the Company's properties is included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 37 through 73.

The Company believes that its properties are generally in good operating
condition and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings.

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to
lawsuits, taxes, real estate, environmental and other matters arising in the normal
course of business. The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
categories of lawsuits and other matters. Except as stated below, the Company believes
that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already provided for these
matters in the Consolidated Financial Statements, is not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's annual results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

Franchising

A substantial number of the restaurants of each of the Concepts are
franchised to independent businesses operating under arrangements with the Concepts. In
the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company
and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, without limitation,
quality, service, and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants, transfers or
terminations of franchises, territorial disputes and delinquent payments.


Suppliers

The Company, through approved distributors, purchases food, paper,
equipment and other restaurant supplies from numerous independent suppliers throughout
the world. These suppliers are required to meet and maintain compliance with the
Company's standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company
and its suppliers on a number of issues, including, but not limited to, compliance with
product specifications and terms of procurement and service requirements.

Employees

At any given time, the Company employs hundreds of thousands of persons,
primarily in its restaurants. In addition, each year thousands of persons seek employment
with the Company and its restaurants. From time to time, disputes arise regarding
employee hiring, compensation, termination and promotion practices.

Like some other retail employers, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have been faced
in a few states with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled

Bravo, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

("Bravo"), was filed in the Circuit Court of
the State of Oregon of the County of Multnomah. The lawsuit was filed by two former Taco
Bell shift managers purporting to represent approximately 17,000 current and former
hourly employees statewide. The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour laws,
principally involving unpaid wages including overtime, and rest and meal period
violations, and seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Under Oregon class action
procedures, Taco Bell was allowed an opportunity to "cure" the unpaid wage and hour
allegations by opening a claims process to all putative class members prior to
certification of the class. In this cure process, Taco Bell has paid out less than $1
million. On January 26, 1999, the Court certified a class of all current and former shift
managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged violations. A trial date
of November 2, 1999 was set. However, on November 1, 1999, the Court issued a proposed
order postponing the trial and establishing a pre-trial claims process. The final order
regarding the claims process was entered on January 14, 2000. Taco Bell moved for
certification of an immediate appeal of the Court-ordered claims process and requested a
stay of the proceedings. This motion was denied on February 8, 2000. Taco Bell appealed
this decision to the Supreme Court of Oregon and the Court denied Taco Bell's Writ of
Mandamus on March 21, 2000. A Court-approved notice and claim form was mailed to
approximately 14,500 class members on January 31, 2000. The Court ordered pre-trial
claims process went forward, and hearings to determine potential damages were held for
claimants employed or previously employed in four selected Taco Bell units. After the
initial hearings relating to these four units, the damage claims hearings were
discontinued. Trial began on January 4, 2001. On March 9, 2001, the jury reached verdicts
on the substantive issues in this matter. A number of these verdicts were in favor of the
Taco Bell position; however, certain issues were decided in favor of the plaintiffs. The
Court reduced the number of potential claimants to 1,100. A jury trial to determine the
damages of 93 of those claimants began on February 25, 2002, and is expected to last six
to eight weeks.

We have provided for the estimated costs of the Bravo litigation, based
on a projection of eligible claims (including claims filed to date, where applicable),
the cost of each eligible claim, the estimated legal fees incurred by plaintiffs and the
results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters.
Although the outcome of this case cannot be determined at this time, we believe the
ultimate cost of this case in excess of the amounts already provided will not be material
to our annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Any provisions
have been recorded as unusual items.

On May 11, 1998, a purported class action lawsuit against Pizza Hut,
Inc., and one of its franchisees, PacPizza, LLC, entitled

Aguardo, et al. v. Pizza Hut,
Inc., et al.,

was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California of the County of
San Francisco. The lawsuit was filed by three former Pizza Hut restaurant general
managers purporting to represent approximately 1,300 current and


former California
restaurant general managers of Pizza Hut and PacPizza, LLC. The lawsuit alleged
violations of state wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and vacation pay
and sought an unspecified amount in damages. On January 12, 2000, the Court certified a
class of approximately 1,300 current and former restaurant general managers. The Court
amended the class on June 1, 2000 to include approximately 150 additional current and
former restaurant general managers. On May 2, 2001, the parties reached an agreement to
settle this matter and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the case. The
Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on September 27, 2001, and final
approval of the settlement on December 20, 2001. As no objections to the settlement were
made, the Court's order approving the settlement and dismissing with prejudice all claims
is final and non-appealable. We have provided for the costs of this settlement as unusual
items.

On October 2, 1996, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled

Mynaf, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.,

was filed in the Superior Court of the State
of California of the County of Santa Clara. The lawsuit was filed by two former
restaurant general managers and two former assistant restaurant general managers
purporting to represent all current and former Taco Bell restaurant general managers and
assistant restaurant general managers in California. The lawsuit alleged violations of
California wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and violations of the State
Labor Code's record-keeping requirements. The complaint also included an unfair business
practices claim. Plaintiffs claimed individual damages ranging from $10,000 to $100,000
each. On September 17, 1998, the court certified a class of approximately 3,000 current
and former assistant restaurant general managers and restaurant general managers. Taco
Bell petitioned the appellate court to review the trial court's certification order. The
petition was denied on December 31, 1998. Taco Bell then filed a petition for review with
the California Supreme Court, and the petition was subsequently denied. Class notices
were mailed on August 31, 1999 to over 3,400 class members. Trial began on January 29,
2001. Before conclusion of the trial, the parties reached an agreement to settle this
matter, and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the case. This settlement
agreement was approved by the court on September 21, 2001. We have provided for the costs
of this settlement as unusual items.

Customers

The Company's restaurants serve a large and diverse cross-section of the
public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise regarding products,
service, accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of
the Company.

Intellectual Property

The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, many of which
are of material importance to the Company's business. From time to time, the Company may
become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of such registered marks.

Other Litigation

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled

Wrench
LLC, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

("Wrench") was filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit alleges
that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising
featuring a Chihuahua. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages under several theories,
including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea misappropriation, conversion and
unfair competition. On June 10, 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment in
favor of Taco Bell Corp. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit (the "Court of Appeals"), and oral arguments were held on September 20,
2000. On July 6, 2001, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment in
favor of Taco Bell and remanded the case to the District Court. Taco Bell Corp.
unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on January 21, 2002.
The case has now officially been returned to the District Court, where the Wrench
plaintiffs will be allowed to bring their claims to trial.

We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs' claims are without merit and are
vigorously defending the case. However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time. Likewise, the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.


C&F Packing Co., Inc. v. Pizza Hut, Inc.

This action was originally filed
in 1993 by C&F Packing Co., Inc., a Chicago meat packing company ("C&F"), in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This lawsuit alleges that
Pizza Hut misappropriated various trade secrets relating to C&F's alleged process for
manufacturing a precooked Italian sausage pizza topping. C&F's trade secret claims against
Pizza Hut were originally dismissed by the trial court on statute of limitations grounds.
That ruling was later overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
August 2000 and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. On
remand, Pizza Hut moved for summary judgment on its statute of limitations defense. That
motion was denied in January 2001. This lawsuit was scheduled for trial in late January
2002. Prior to trial, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement pursuant to
which C&F agreed to dismiss the case in exchange for a lump sum payment from Pizza Hut.
This payment has been made and the case was dismissed with prejudice effective February
6, 2002. We have provided for the costs of this settlement as unusual items in 2001.

N/A - Not Applicable.

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("TRICON") became an
independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 through the spin-off of the
restaurant operations of its former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo"), to its
shareholders. The 1997 consolidated financial data was prepared as if we had been an
independent, publicly owned company for that period. To facilitate this presentation,
PepsiCo made certain allocations of its previously unallocated interest and general and
administrative expenses as well as pro forma computations, to the extent possible, of
separate income tax provisions for its restaurant segment. Fiscal years 2001, 1999, 1998
and 1997 include 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2000 includes 53 weeks. The selected financial
data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Notes thereto.

Excludes Non-core Businesses, which were disposed of in 1997.  See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Declining Company sales are largely the result of our refranchising initiatives.

In the fourth  quarter of 1997, we recorded a $530 million  charge of which $410 million was recorded in facility  actions net
     (loss) and $120 million was recorded in unusual items.  The charge  included (a) costs of closing  stores;  (b) reductions to fair
     market value, less cost to sell, of the carrying amounts of certain  restaurants that we intended to refranchise;  (c) impairments
     of certain restaurants intended to be used in the business; (d) impairments of certain  unconsolidated  affiliates to be retained;
     and (e) costs of related personnel  reductions.  In 1999, we recorded favorable adjustments of $13 million in facility actions net
     gain and $11 million in unusual items related to our 1997 fourth quarter  charge.  In 1998, we recorded  favorable  adjustments of
     $54 million in facility actions net gain and $11 million in unusual items related to our 1997 fourth quarter charge.

See Note 5 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements for a description of unusual items income  (expense) in 2001,  2000 and
     1999. 1997 included $54 million related to the disposal of the Non-core Businesses.

EPS data has been omitted for 1997 as our capital structure as an independent, publicly owned company did not exist.

Operating  working capital deficit is current assets  excluding cash and cash  equivalents  and short-term  investments,  less
     current liabilities excluding short-term borrowings.


Item 7.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred
to as "TRICON" or the "Company") is comprised of the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell ("the Concepts") and is the world's largest quick service restaurant
("QSR") company based on the number of system units. Separately, each brand ranks in the
top ten among QSR chains in U.S. system sales and units. Our 10,927 international units
make us the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. TRICON became an independent,
publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the "Spin-off Date") via a tax-free
distribution of our Common Stock (the "Distribution" or "Spin-off") to the shareholders
of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo").

TRICON has numerous registered trademarks and service marks. We believe
that many of these marks, including our Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®, Pizza Hut® and Taco
Bell® trademarks, have significant value and are materially important to our business. Our
policy is to pursue registration of important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose
vigorously any infringement of our trademarks. From time to time we may become involved
in litigation to defend and protect our use of such registered marks. The use of our
trademarks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell franchise and license agreements. Under current law and with proper use, our rights
in trademarks can generally last indefinitely. We also have certain patents on restaurant
equipment which, while valuable, are not material to our business.

Throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"), we make
reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the
impact of facility actions net loss (gain), unusual items income (expense) and our
accounting and human resources policy changes in 1999 (the "1999 accounting changes").
See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these
exclusions. We use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results
of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to
forecast future performance. Ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S.

In 2001, our international business, Tricon Restaurants International
("TRI" or "International") accounted for 35% of system sales, 31% of revenues and 31% of
ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign
exchange net loss. We anticipate that, despite the inherent risks and typically higher
general and administrative expenses required by international operations, we will
continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 37 through 73 and the Cautionary Statements on page 36. All Note
references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 42
through 73. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count
amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified.


Critical Accounting Policies

Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain
accounting policies that required us to make subjective or complex judgments. These
judgments involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain
and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly
affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. We
believe that our most significant policies require:

Estimation of cash flows  associated  with the  disposition  of  restaurants,  and the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets and
     investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  See Note 2 for a further discussion.

Determination  of the appropriate  allowances and reserves  associated  with franchise and license  receivables and contingent
     liabilities.  See Note 2 for a discussion of the allowance for uncollectible  franchise and license  receivables and Note 22 for a
     discussion of franchise contingent liabilities.

Estimation,  using  actuarially-determined  methods, of our self-insured losses under our property and casualty loss programs.
     See Note 22 for a discussion of our insurance programs.

Determination of the appropriate  valuation  allowances for deferred tax assets and reserves for potential tax exposures.  See
     Note 20 for a discussion of income taxes.

Impact of AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process

See Note 22 for a discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe Food
Distribution, Inc. ("AmeriServe") bankruptcy reorganization process on the Company.

Franchisee Financial Condition

Like others in the QSR industry, from time to time, some of our franchise
operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations.
During 2001 and 2000, certain of our franchise operators, principally in the Taco Bell
system experienced varying degrees of financial problems.

Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation, and in the
absence of an improvement in the franchisee's business trends, there are a number of
potential resolutions of these financial issues. These include a sale of some or all of
the operator's restaurants to us or a third party, a restructuring of the operator's
business and/or finances, or, in the more unusual cases, bankruptcy of the operator. It
is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an
attempt to positively resolve their issues.

Through February 11, 2002, restructurings have been completed for
approximately 1,000 Taco Bell franchise restaurants. In connection with these
restructurings, Taco Bell has acquired 123 restaurants for approximately $65 million
through December 29, 2001. In addition to these acquisitions, Taco Bell purchased 19
restaurants from franchisees for approximately $12 million and simultaneously leased the
restaurants back to these franchisees under long-term leases. As part of the restructurings, Taco Bell
has committed to fund approximately $29 million of future franchise capital expenditures,
principally through leasing arrangements.  In the fourth quarter of
2000, Taco Bell established a $15 million loan program to assist certain franchisees. All
fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of 2001, and the resulting
notes receivable are primarily included in Other assets.

We believe that the recent improvement in business trends at Taco Bell
has helped alleviate financial problems in the Taco Bell franchise system which were due
to past downturns in sales. Accordingly, though we continue to monitor this situation, we
expect restructurings of the remaining Taco Bell franchise restaurants with financial
issues to be significantly less in number and costs in 2002.


In 2001 and 2000, the Company charged expenses of $18 million and $26
million, respectively, to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful
franchise and license fee receivables. These costs are reported as franchise and license
expenses. On an ongoing basis, we assess our exposure from franchise-related risks, which
include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables, contingent lease
liabilities, guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements of
franchisees and potential claims by franchisees. The contingent lease liabilities and
guarantees are more fully discussed in the Contingent Liabilities section of Note 22.
Although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with
certainty at this time, we have provided for our current estimate of the probable
exposure as of December 29, 2001. It is reasonably possible that there will be additional
costs; however, these cost are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Unusual Items (Income) Expense

We recorded unusual items income of $3 million in 2001 and unusual items
expense of $204 million in 2000 and $51 million in 1999. See Note 5 for a detailed
discussion of our unusual items (income) expense.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded expenses of approximately $4
million related to streamlining certain support functions, which included the termination
of approximately 90 employees. The reserves established, which primarily related to
severance, were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of 2002. We expect to incur
additional costs of approximately $2 million in 2002 related to these actions, which will
be expensed as incurred. Beginning in 2002, we anticipate savings in general and
administrative expenses ("G&A") of approximately $6 million per year, primarily related to
reduced compensation. However, we expect to reinvest a substantial portion of these
savings in our growth initiatives, including multibranding.

Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates

Consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international
markets, we formed new ventures in Canada and Poland with our largest franchisee in each
market. The venture in Canada was formed in the third quarter of 2000 and the venture in
Poland was effective in the first quarter of 2001. The Canadian venture operates over 700
stores and the Poland venture operates approximately 100 stores. We did not record any
gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures.

Previously, the results from the restaurants we contributed to these
ventures were consolidated. The impact of these transactions on operating results is
similar to the impact of our refranchising activities, which is described in the Store
Portfolio Strategy section below. Consequently, these transactions resulted in a decline
in our Company sales, restaurant margin dollars and G&A as well as higher franchise fees.
We also record equity income (losses) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates
("equity income") and, in Canada, higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was
increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture. The formation of
these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001.

Impact of the Consolidation of an Unconsolidated Affiliate

At the beginning of 2001, we consolidated a previously unconsolidated
affiliate in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of a change in our intent
to temporarily retain control of this affiliate. This change resulted in higher Company
sales, restaurant margin dollars and G&A as well as decreased franchise fees and equity
income. This previously unconsolidated affiliate operates over 100 stores.


Fifty-third Week in 2000

Our fiscal calendar results in a fifty-third week every 5 or 6 years.
Fiscal year 2000 included a fifty-third week in the fourth quarter. The estimated
favorable impact in net income was $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share in 2000. The
following table summarizes the estimated favorable/(unfavorable) impact of the
fifty-third week on system sales, revenues and ongoing operating profit:

Store Portfolio Strategy

Since 1995, we have been strategically reducing our share of total system
units by selling Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their
expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while
retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and International markets. This
portfolio-balancing activity has reduced our reported revenues and restaurant profits and
has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure. We
substantially completed our refranchising program in 2001.

The following table summarizes our refranchising activities:

2001          2000             1999
                                                  -----------   -------------   -----------
    Number of units refranchised                       233           757            1,435
    Refranchising proceeds, pre-tax               $    111      $    381        $     916
    Refranchising net gains, pre-tax(a)           $     39      $    200        $     422

2001 includes $12 million of  previously  deferred  refranchising  gains and a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net
         assets of the Singapore business, which is held for sale.

In addition to our refranchising program, we have been closing
restaurants over the past several years. Restaurants closed include poor performing
restaurants, restaurants that are relocated to a new site within the same trade area or
U.S. Pizza Hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine-in traditional
store within the same trade area.


The following table summarizes Company store closure activities:

2001          2000            1999
                                                  -----------   -------------   -----------
    Number of units closed                             270           208              301

    Impairment charges for stores to be closed    $      5      $      6        $      12

Includes  favorable  adjustments  to our 1997 fourth  quarter  charge of $9 million in 1999.  See Note 5 for a  discussion  of
         these adjustments.

The impact on ongoing operating profit arising from our refranchising and
store closure initiatives as well as the contribution of Company stores to new
unconsolidated affiliates as described in the Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates
section represents the net of (a) the estimated reduction in Company sales, restaurant
margin and G&A; (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees; and (c) the estimated change
in equity income. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores
that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were
no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year.

Worldwide System Sales

System sales increased approximately $169 million or 1% in 2001, after a
2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact
of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, system sales
increased 5%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales
growth, partially offset by store closures.

System sales increased $397 million or 2% in 2000, after a 1% unfavorable
impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign
currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty-third week, system sales
increased 1%. This increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store
closures and same store sales declines.

Worldwide Revenues

Company sales decreased $167 million or 3% in 2001, after a 2%
unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, Company sales were
flat. An increase due to new unit development was offset by refranchising.

Company sales decreased $794 million or 11% in 2000. Excluding the
favorable impact from the fifty-third week, Company sales decreased 12%. The decrease was
primarily due to refranchising, store closures, the contribution of Company stores to a
new unconsolidated affiliate and same store sales declines. This decrease was partially
offset by new unit development.

Franchise and license fees increased $27 million or 3% in 2001, after a
2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact
of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, franchise and
license fees increased 7%. The increase was driven by new unit development, units
acquired from us and same store sales growth. This increase was partially offset by store
closures.

Franchise and license fees increased $65 million or 9% in 2000. The
increase was primarily driven by units acquired from us and new unit development
partially offset by store closures and same store sales declines in the U.S. The
unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was essentially offset by the
favorable impact of the fifty-third week.

Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 30
basis points in 2001. U.S. restaurant margin was flat and International restaurant margin
declined approximately 120 basis points.

Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 25
basis points in 2000, including the unfavorable impact of 15 basis points from lapping
the 1999 accounting changes. U.S. restaurant margin declined approximately 55 basis
points and International restaurant margin increased approximately 65 basis points.


Worldwide General And Administrative Expenses

G&A decreased $34 million or 4% in 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of
lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, G&A decreased 3%. The decrease was driven by lower
corporate and project spending, the formation of unconsolidated affiliates and
refranchising. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation costs.

G&A decreased $65 million or 7% in 2000. Excluding the unfavorable impact
from lapping the 1999 accounting changes, G&A decreased 9%. The decrease was primarily due
to lower incentive compensation expense and Year 2000 costs as well as the favorable
impact of refranchising and store closures. Reduced spending on conferences also
contributed to the decline. G&A included Year 2000 spending of approximately $2 million in
2000 as compared to approximately $30 million in 1999.

Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses

Franchise and license expenses increased $10 million or 20% in 2001. The
increase was primarily due to support costs related to the financial restructuring of
certain Taco Bell franchisees. The increase was partially offset by lower allowances for
doubtful franchise and license fee receivables.

Franchise and license expenses increased $24 million or 93% in 2000. The
increase was driven by allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables,
principally at Taco Bell.

Equity income increased $1 million or 3% in 2001, after a 6% unfavorable
impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by improved results of
our unconsolidated affiliate in the United Kingdom. The increase was offset by equity
losses from Poland and the consolidation of a previously unconsolidated affiliate.

Equity income increased $6 million or 32% in 2000. The increase was
primarily due to improved results of our unconsolidated affiliates in Japan, the United
Kingdom and China.

Worldwide Facility Actions Net Loss (Gain)

The changes in U.S. and International ongoing operating profit for 2001
and 2000 are discussed in the respective sections.

Unallocated and corporate expenses decreased $15 million or 9% in 2001.
Excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, G&A decreased 8%.
The decline was primarily due to lower corporate and project spending partially offset by
higher incentive and deferred compensation.

Excluding the unfavorable impact from lapping the 1999 accounting
changes, unallocated and corporate expenses decreased $31 million or 16% in 2000. The
decline was primarily due to lower Year 2000 spending and lower incentive compensation
expense.

Net interest expense decreased $18 million or 10% in 2001. The decrease
was primarily due to a decrease in our average interest rates.

Net interest expense decreased $26 million or 13% in 2000. The decline
was due to lower average debt outstanding in 2000 as compared to 1999, partially offset
by an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As discussed in Note 22,
interest expense on incremental borrowings related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization process of $9 million has been included in unusual items expense in 2000.

                                                 =========   =========   =========

The 2001 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 4.6 percentage points to
33.1%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments
related to prior years, partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals. See
Note 20 for a discussion of valuation allowances.

In 2001, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was
slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate because losses of foreign operations
for which no benefit could be currently recognized and other adjustments more than offset
the effect of claiming credit against our U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes
paid.

The 2000 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 1.6 percentage points to
37.7%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in
the tax on our international operations, including the initial benefits of becoming
eligible in 2000 to claim substantially all of our available foreign income tax credits
for foreign taxes paid in 2000 against our U.S. income tax liability, and incremental
valuation allowance reversals. This decrease was partially offset by adjustments relating
to prior years.

In 2000, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was
lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to our ability to claim credit against our
U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid. The effective tax rate attributable to
foreign operations in 1999 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. This was
primarily due to foreign tax rate differentials, including foreign withholding tax paid
without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for U.S. income tax purposes and losses
of foreign operations for which no tax benefit could be currently recognized.

Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was flat in 2001. Favorable
pricing and product mix was offset by increases in occupancy and other costs, product
costs and wage rates. The increase in product costs was primarily driven by cheese costs.

Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 55 basis points in
2000, including a decline of approximately 25 basis points resulting from lapping the
1999 accounting changes. The remaining decrease primarily resulted from a shift to lower
margin chicken sandwiches at KFC, volume declines at Taco Bell and the absence of
favorable 1999 insurance-related adjustments. The decrease was partially offset by the
favorable impact of refranchising and pricing and product mix. Favorable product costs,
primarily cheese, were almost fully offset by higher occupancy and other costs and higher
wage rates.

U.S. Ongoing Operating Profit

Ongoing operating profit decreased $20 million or 3% in 2001. Excluding
the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, ongoing operating profit
decreased 1%. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable impact of refranchising and
store closures, higher restaurant operating costs and higher franchise support costs
related to the restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees. The decrease was partially
offset by favorable pricing and product mix and new unit development.


Ongoing operating profit decreased $71 million or 9% in 2000. Excluding
the favorable impact of the fifty-third week, ongoing operating profit decreased 12%. The
decrease was primarily due to same store sales declines, the unfavorable impact of
refranchising and store closures and higher restaurant operating costs. The decrease was
partially offset by new unit development and reduced G&A expenses. The decrease in G&A expenses
was largely due to lower incentive compensation, decreased professional fees and lower
spending on conferences at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The G&A declines were partially offset
by higher franchise-related expenses, primarily allowances for doubtful franchise and
license fee receivables.

2000. The increase was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of refranchising,
the contribution of Company stores with below average margins to a new unconsolidated
affiliate and store closures.


International Ongoing Operating Profit

Ongoing operating profit increased $9 million or 3%, after a 7%
unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty-third week in 2000, ongoing operating
profit increased 12%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store
sales growth, partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs.

Ongoing operating profit increased $44 million or 16% in 2000, after a 2%
unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty-third week, ongoing
operating profit increased 16%. The increase was primarily due to new unit development.

Consolidated Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities

increased $341 million to $832
million. The increase was primarily due to the collection of receivables established in
2000 and the absence of the unusual charges taken in 2000 related to the AmeriServe
bankruptcy reorganization process. Excluding the AmeriServe-related items, cash provided
by operating activities was $704 million versus $734 million in 2000. See Note 22 for a
discussion of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process.

In 2000, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $74 million
to $491 million. The decrease was primarily due to unusual charges related to the
AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process and the related use of working capital. The
primary driver of the net use of working capital was an increase in receivables arising
from the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, which resulted in a net use of
working capital of approximately $135 million. Excluding these AmeriServe-related items,
cash from operating activities increased by $143 million to $734 million. This increase
was driven by a lower reduction of our working capital deficit than in 1999.

Our working capital deficit, excluding cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and short-term borrowings, is typical of restaurant operations
where a majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment
terms, generally from 10-30 days. The lower working capital deficit reduction in 2000 is
the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in 2000 versus 1999,
partially offset by a change in payment terms in our food and supply distribution
agreement from 30 to 15 days.

Net cash used in investing activities

was $503 million versus $237
million in 2000. The increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising
proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in 2001 and increased acquisition and
capital spending. The increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a
debtor-in-possession revolving credit facility to AmeriServe in 2000.

In 2000, net cash used in investing activities was $237 million versus
net cash provided of $522 million in 1999. The decline in cash flow from investing
activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling
fewer restaurants to franchisees in 2000 versus 1999, increased capital spending related
to development and funding of a debtor-in-possession revolving credit facility to
AmeriServe.

Although we report gross proceeds in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, we also consider refranchising proceeds on an "after-tax" basis. We define
after-tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital
liabilities (primarily accounts payable and property taxes) related to the units
refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains. The after-tax proceeds can be used to pay
down debt or repurchase shares. After-tax proceeds were approximately $90 million in 2001
which reflects a 65% decrease from 2000. This decrease was due to the refranchising of
fewer restaurants in 2001 versus 2000. After-tax proceeds were approximately $261 million
in 2000, a 62% decrease versus 1999. This decrease was also due to refranchising fewer
restaurants in 2000 than 1999.


Net cash used in financing activities

was $352 million compared to $207
million in 2000. The increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt
partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000.

In 2000, net cash used in financing activities decreased to $207 million
versus $1.1 billion in 1999 due to lower debt repayments. Less cash was available for
financing activities in 2000 due to lower cash flow from operating and investing
activities, as described above.

In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a new share
repurchase program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through February 14, 2003,
up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction
fees). During 2001, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for approximately
$100 million. See Note 19 for a discussion of the share repurchase program.

In 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350
million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). This
share repurchase program was completed in 2000. During 2000, we repurchased over 6.4
million shares for approximately $216 million. See Note 19 for a discussion of the share
repurchase program.

Financing Activities

As more fully discussed in Note 12, our primary bank credit agreement, as
amended, is comprised of a senior, unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion
senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which was reduced from $3 billion as part of
the amendment discussed below (collectively referred to as the "Credit Facilities"). The
Credit Facilities mature on October 2, 2002. At December 29, 2001, we had unused
Revolving Credit Facility borrowings available aggregating $2.7 billion, net of
outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 billion.

Amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities of $536 million at
December 29, 2001 have been classified as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet due to the October 2002 maturity. We are currently in negotiations to
replace the Credit Facilities prior to the maturity date with new borrowings, which will
reflect the market conditions and terms available at that time.

The Credit Facilities subject us to certain mandatory principal repayment
obligations, including prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement. Interest on
the Credit Facilities is based principally on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")
plus a variable margin factor; therefore, our borrowing costs fluctuate depending upon
the volatility in LIBOR.

On February 22, 2002, we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms
of our Credit Facilities. This amendment provides for, among other things, additional
flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments. In addition, we
voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $3.0
billion to $1.75 billion. As a result of this amendment, we capitalized debt costs of
approximately $1.5 million. These costs will be amortized into interest expense over the
remaining life of the Credit Facilities.

We issued $850 million of unsecured Notes in 2001. The issuance included
$200 million of 8.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2006 and $650 million of 8.875%
Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2011. We used the proceeds, net of issuance costs,
to reduce amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. We still have $550 million
available for issuance under a $2 billion shelf registration. See Note 12 for further
discussion.

We use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps,
to lower interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate risk. See Notes 2 and
14 as well as our market risk disclosure for further discussion of our interest rate risk.


Consolidated Financial Condition

Assets

increased $239 million or 6% to $4.4 billion. The increase was
primarily attributable to a net increase in property, plant and equipment driven by
capital spending and acquisitions in excess of depreciation, refranchising and
disposition of assets. The fair value of derivatives recorded as a result of the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") also contributed to the increase. These
increases were partially offset by a reduction in net receivables primarily related to
the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process.

Liabilities

decreased $187 million or 4% to $4.3 billion. The decrease
was primarily attributable to net paydown of debt, partially offset by increases related
to the adoption of SFAS 133.

Liquidity

Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash
flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which
require a limited TRICON investment in operating assets. Typically, our cash flows
include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending. Though a decline in
revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating
cash flows and our ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will
allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2002 and beyond.

Significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 29, 2001
due by year include:

These  obligations,  which are shown on a nominal  basis,  relate to  operating  and capital  leases for  approximately  4,400
restaurants.

See Note 12 for a discussion of short-term borrowings and long-term debt
and Note 13 for a discussion of leases.


In addition, we have certain other commercial commitments where payment
is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. As of December 29, 2001, the maximum
exposure under these commercial commitments, which are shown on a nominal basis, include:

Contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments     $     435
Standby letters of credit(a)                                       204

Includes $32 million related to guarantees of financial  arrangements of franchisees,  which are supported by stand-by letters
      of credit.

See Notes 12 and 22 for a further discussion of these commitments.

Our unconsolidated affiliates also have long-term debt outstanding. As of
December 29, 2001 this debt totaled approximately $134 million, our share of which was
approximately $68 million. As noted above, we have guaranteed $12 million of this total
debt obligation. Our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over $900 million as
of year-end 2001 and total revenues of approximately $1.6 billion in 2001.

Other Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact 2002
Ongoing Operating Profit Comparisons with 2001

Euro Conversion

Twelve of the fifteen member countries of the European Economic and
Monetary Union adopted the Euro as a common legal currency. We have Company and franchise
businesses in the adopting member countries. Beginning January 1, 2002, new
Euro-denominated bills and coins were issued, and a transition period of two months
began. During the transition period local currencies were removed from circulation. We
took actions to mitigate our risks related to the Euro conversion efforts including the
rollout of Euro-ready point-of-sale ("POS") equipment and back-of-house hardware and
software. We have not experienced any significant issues or unexpected business problems
resulting from the Euro conversion. Given the absence of any significant problems to
date, we do not expect Euro conversion issues to have a material adverse effect on
TRICON's operations or financial results in 2002.

Expenditures associated with our conversion efforts totaled approximately
$5 million of which $3 million was incurred during 2001. Approximately 30% of these costs
related to capital expenditures for new POS equipment and back-of-house hardware and
software. The remaining expenditures were mainly related to consulting expenses for
initial impact studies and head office accounting systems. We do not expect to incur
significant Euro-related expenditures in 2002.

Consumer acceptance of the Euro has not significantly impacted our
business to date. From a competitive perspective, we continue to assess the impact of
product price transparency, potential revisions to our product bundling strategies, and
the creation of Euro-friendly price points. We do not believe that these activities will
have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses.

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of
business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of
strategies, which include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to
hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments
for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use.

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates,
principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall
borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily
interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have
reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any
change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite
market impact on the related debt.

At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, a hypothetical 100 basis
point increase in short-term interest rates would result in a reduction of $4 million and
$19 million, respectively, in annual income before taxes. The estimated reductions are
based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the
volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our interest rate swaps at
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 would decrease approximately $5 million and $11
million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 29, 2001
and December 30, 2000 would decrease approximately $72 million and $25 million,
respectively. The significant change in the decrease of the fair market value between
2001 and 2000 was primarily due to the additional Senior Unsecured Notes issued in 2001.
Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

International ongoing operating profit constituted approximately 31% and
29% of our 2001 and 2000 ongoing operating profit, respectively, excluding unallocated
and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss. In addition, the Company's net
asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities)
totaled approximately $1 billion and $900 million as of December 29, 2001 and December
30, 2000, respectively. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's primary exposures result from
our operations in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates
would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of
our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency
denominated earnings and cash flows.

We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign
operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In
addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated
financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local
currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial
instruments consist primarily of intercompany short-term receivables and payables. At
times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our risk exposure related to these foreign
currency denominated financial instruments. The notional amount and maturity dates of
these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our
foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. On a limited
basis, we utilize forward contracts in order to reduce our risk exposure related to
certain foreign currency denominated cash flows from royalties. There were no such
forward contracts outstanding as of December 29, 2001.


Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk
associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher
pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We
manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a
limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. There were no commodity future and
option contracts outstanding at December 29, 2001, and those outstanding at December 30,
2000, were not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cautionary Statements

From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we
present "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The statements include those identified by such words as "may," "will,"
"expect," "anticipate," "believe," "plan" and other similar terminology. These
"forward-looking statements" reflect our current expectations regarding future events and
operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the
statements. Actual results involve risks and uncertainties, including both those specific
to the Company and those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from
expectations.

Company risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the Spin-off, which, if they occur,
require us to indemnify PepsiCo, Inc.; our substantial debt leverage and the attendant
potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future, as well as our substantial
interest expense and principal repayment obligations; our ability to replace or refinance
the Credit Facilities at reasonable rates; potential unfavorable variances between
estimated and actual liabilities including the liabilities related to the sale of the
non-core businesses; our ability to secure alternative distribution of products and
equipment to our restaurants and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant
products and equipment in our stores; our ability to complete our Euro conversion plans
or the ability of our key suppliers to be Euro-compliant; the ongoing financial viability
of our franchisees and licensees; volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss
estimates and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including
pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies.

Industry risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, global
and local business, economic and political conditions; legislation and governmental
regulation; competitor activities; success of operating initiatives and advertising and
promotional efforts; volatility of commodity costs; increases in minimum wage and other
operating costs; availability and cost of land and construction; consumer preferences,
spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic instability in local
markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(tabular amounts in millions, except share data)

Note 1 - Description of Business

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred
to as "TRICON" or the "Company") is comprised of the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell (the "Concepts") and is the world's largest quick service restaurant
company based on the number of system units, with over 30,000 units in more than 100
countries and territories. Approximately 36% of our system units are located outside the
U.S. TRICON was created as an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the
"Spin-off Date") via a tax-free distribution by our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc.
("PepsiCo"), of our Common Stock (the "Distribution" or "Spin-off") to its shareholders.
References to TRICON throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are made using
the first person notations of "we," "us " or "our."

Through our widely-recognized Concepts, we develop, operate, franchise
and license a system of both traditional and non-traditional quick service restaurants.
Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high
quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices. Our traditional restaurants
feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery service.
Non-traditional units, which are principally licensed outlets, include express units and
kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like
airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and
colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. We
are actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding, where two or more of our Concepts
are operated in a single restaurant unit. In addition, we are testing multibranding
options involving one of our Concepts and a restaurant concept not owned or affiliated
with TRICON.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from the estimates.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Preparation.

Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in businesses in which we
exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for by the equity method.
Our share of the net income or loss of those unconsolidated affiliates and net foreign
exchange gains or losses are included in other (income) expense.

Fiscal Year.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and,
as a result, a fifty-third week is added every five or six years. Fiscal year 2000
included 53 weeks. The first three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and
the fourth quarter consists of 17 weeks in fiscal years with 53 weeks and 16 weeks in
fiscal years with 52 weeks. Our subsidiaries operate on similar fiscal calendars with
period end dates suited to their businesses. The subsidiaries' period end dates are
within one week of TRICON's period end date with the exception of our international
businesses, which close one period or one month earlier to facilitate consolidated
reporting.

Reclassifications.

We have reclassified certain items in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for prior periods to be comparable
with the classification we adopted for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001. These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.


Franchise and License Operations.

We execute franchise or license
agreements for each point of distribution which sets out the terms of our arrangement
with the franchisee or licensee. Our franchise and certain license agreements require the
franchisee or licensee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based
upon a percentage of sales. Subject to our approval and payment of a renewal fee, a
franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration.

We recognize initial fees as revenue when we have performed substantially
all initial services required by the franchise or license agreement, which is generally
upon opening of a store. We recognize continuing fees as earned with an appropriate
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, which is included in franchise and license
expenses. We recognize renewal fees in income when a renewal agreement becomes effective.
We include initial fees collected upon the sale of a restaurant to a franchisee in
refranchising gains (losses). Fees for development rights are capitalized and amortized
over the life of the development agreement.

We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities
and their representative organizations and our company operated restaurants. These
expenses, along with other costs of sales and servicing of franchise and license
agreements are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred. Certain direct
costs of our franchise and license operations are charged to franchise and license
expenses. These costs include provisions for estimated uncollectible fees, franchise and
license marketing funding, amortization expense for franchise related intangible assets
and certain other direct incremental franchise and license support costs. Franchise and
license expenses also includes rent income from subleasing restaurants to franchisees net
of the related occupancy costs.

We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and
record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our
franchisees or licensees are unable to make their required payments. While we use the
best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded
receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may
be beyond our control. Included in franchise and license expenses are provisions for uncollectible franchise and license
receivables of $24 million, $30 million and $2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Direct Marketing Costs.

We report substantially all of our direct
marketing costs in occupancy and other operating expenses. We charge direct marketing
costs to expense ratably in relation to revenues over the year in which incurred and, in
the case of advertising production costs, in the year first shown. Deferred direct
marketing costs, which are classified as prepaid expenses, consist of media and related
advertising production costs which will generally be used for the first time in the next
fiscal year. To the extent we participate in independent advertising cooperatives, we
expense our contributions as incurred. At the end of 2001 and 2000, we had deferred
marketing costs of $2 million and $8 million, respectively. Our advertising expenses were
$328 million, $325 million and $385 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses,
which we expense as incurred, were $28 million in 2001 and $24 million in both 2000 and
1999.

Refranchising Gains (Losses).

Refranchising gains (losses) includes the
gains or losses from the sales of our restaurants to new and existing franchisees and the
related initial franchise fees, reduced by transaction costs and direct administrative
costs of refranchising. In executing our refranchising initiatives, we most often offer
groups of restaurants. We recognize gains on restaurant refranchisings when the sale
transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in at-risk
equity, and we are satisfied that the franchisee can meet its financial obligations. If
the criteria for gain recognition are not met, we defer the gain to the extent we have a
remaining financial obligation in connection with the sales transaction. Deferred gains
are recognized when these criteria are met or as our financial obligation is reduced. We
only consider stores "held for disposal" when they are expected to be sold at a loss. We
recognize estimated losses on restaurants to be refranchised and suspend depreciation and
amortization when: (a) we make a decision to refranchise; (b) the estimated fair value
less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the stores; (c) the stores can be
immediately removed from operations; and (d) the sale is probable within one year. When
we make a decision to retain a store previously held for refranchising, we revalue the
store at the lower of its net book value at our


original disposal decision date less normal depreciation and amortization during the period held for disposal or its current
fair market value. This value becomes the store's new cost basis. We charge (or credit)
any difference between the store's carrying amount and its new cost basis to
refranchising gains (losses). When we make a decision to close a store previously held
for refranchising, we reverse any previously recognized refranchising loss and then
record the store closure costs as described below. For groups of restaurants expected to
be sold at a gain, we typically do not suspend depreciation and amortization until the
sale is probable. For practical purposes, we treat the closing date as the point at which
the sale is probable. Refranchising gains (losses) also include charges for estimated
exposures related to those partial guarantees of franchisee loan pools and contingent
lease liabilities which arose from refranchising activities. These exposures are more
fully discussed in Note 22.

Store Closure Costs.

We recognize the impairment of a restaurant's assets
as store closure costs when we have closed or replaced the restaurant within the same
quarter our decision is made. Store closure costs also include costs of disposing of the
assets as well as other facility-related expenses from previously closed stores. These
costs are expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date the closure is considered
probable, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining operating
lease obligations subsequent to the expected closure date, net of estimated sublease
income, if any.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows, including sublease income. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly
from the estimates.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

We review our long-lived assets related
to each restaurant to be held and used in the business, including any allocated
intangible assets, semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.
We evaluate restaurants using a "two-year history of operating losses" as our primary
indicator of potential impairment. Based on the best information available, we write down
an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value, which becomes its new cost
basis. We generally measure estimated fair market value by discounting estimated future
cash flows. In addition, when we decide to close a store beyond the quarter in which the
closure decision is made, it is reviewed for impairment and depreciable lives are
adjusted. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing
use until the expected disposal date plus the expected terminal value.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and
Enterprise-Level Goodwill.

Our methodology for determining and measuring impairment of
our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and enterprise-level goodwill is similar to
the methodology we use for our restaurants except: (a) the recognition test for an
investment in an unconsolidated affiliate compares the carrying amount of our investment
to a forecast of our share of the unconsolidated affiliate's undiscounted cash flows
after interest and taxes instead of undiscounted cash flows before interest and taxes
used for our restaurants; and (b) enterprise-level goodwill is generally evaluated at a
country level instead of by individual restaurant. Also, we record impairment charges
related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates whenever other circumstances indicate
that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash equivalents represent funds we have
temporarily invested (with original maturities not exceeding three months) as part of
managing our day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.

Inventories.

We value our inventories at the lower of cost (computed on
the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.


Property, Plant and Equipment.

We state property, plant and equipment at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, impairment writedowns and valuation
allowances. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 5 to 25 years for buildings and
improvements, 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 7 years for capitalized
software costs. As discussed further above, we suspend depreciation and amortization on
assets related to restaurants that are held for disposal.

Internal Development Costs and Abandoned Site Costs.

We capitalize direct
costs associated with the site acquisition and construction of a Company unit on that
site, including direct internal payroll and payroll-related costs and direct external
costs. Only those site-specific costs incurred subsequent to the time that the site
acquisition is considered probable are capitalized. We consider acquisition probable upon
final site approval. If we subsequently make a determination that a site for which
internal development costs have been capitalized will not be acquired or developed, any
previously capitalized internal development costs are expensed and included in general
and administrative expenses.

Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets include both identifiable
intangibles and goodwill arising from the allocation of purchase prices of businesses
acquired. Where appropriate, intangible assets are allocated to individual restaurants at
the time of acquisition. We base amounts assigned to identifiable intangibles on
independent appraisals or internal estimates. Goodwill represents the residual purchase
price after allocation to all identifiable net assets. Our intangible assets are stated
at historical allocated cost less accumulated amortization and impairment writedowns. We
amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis as follows: up to 20 years for
reacquired franchise rights, 3 to 40 years for trademarks and other identifiable
intangibles and up to 20 years for goodwill. As discussed above, we suspend amortization
on intangible assets allocated to restaurants that are held for disposal.

See "New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted" for a discussion of
the anticipated impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141,
"Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" ("SFAS 142") on our accounting for intangible assets.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation.

We measure stock-based employee
compensation cost for financial statement purposes in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
its related interpretations. We include pro forma information in Note 16 as required by
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly, we
measure compensation cost for stock option grants to employees as the excess of the
average market price of the Common Stock at the grant date over the amount the employee
must pay for the stock. Our policy is to generally grant stock options at the average
market price of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

Our policy prohibits the use of
derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor
and control their use. Our use of derivative instruments has included interest rate
swaps, collars, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts. In
addition, we utilize on a limited basis, commodity futures and options contracts. Our
interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with financial
institutions while our commodity derivative contracts are exchange traded.

Effective December 31, 2000, we adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative
instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as
part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the results of operations. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in the
results of operations immediately. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations immediately. The
cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS 133 was


insignificant. For fiscal years prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, our treatment of derivative instruments was as described in the
following paragraphs.

We recognized the interest differential to be paid or received on
interest rate swap and forward rate agreements as an adjustment to interest expense as
the differential occurred. We recognized the interest differential to be paid or received
on an interest rate collar as an adjustment to interest expense when the interest rate
fell below or rose above the collared range. We reflected the recognized interest
differential not yet settled in cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a
current receivable or payable.

Each period, we recognized in income foreign exchange gains and losses on
forward contracts that were designated and effective as hedges of foreign currency
receivables or payables as the differential occurred. These gains or losses were largely
offset by the corresponding gain or loss recognized in income on the currency translation
of the receivable or payable, as both amounts were based upon the same exchange rates. We
reflected the recognized foreign currency differential for forward contracts not yet
settled in cash on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets each period as a current
receivable or payable. Each period, we recognized in income the change in fair value of
foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts that were entered into to mitigate
the foreign exchange risk of certain forecasted foreign currency denominated royalty
receipts. We reflected the fair value of these forward contracts not yet settled on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a current receivable or payable. If a foreign currency
forward contract was terminated prior to maturity, the gain or loss recognized upon
termination was immediately recognized in income.

We deferred gains and losses on futures and options contracts that were
designated and effective as hedges of future commodity purchases and included them in the
cost of the related raw materials when purchased. Changes in the value of futures and
options contracts that we used to hedge components of our commodity purchases were highly
correlated to changes in the value of the purchased commodity attributable to the hedged
component.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.

In 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 141, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 16,
"Business Combinations." SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase
accounting method. SFAS 141 also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a
purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately
from goodwill. The provisions of SFAS 141 were effective for transactions accounted for
using the purchase method that were completed after June 30, 2001. Such transactions were
not significant for the Company through December 29, 2001.

Historically, the Company's business combinations have primarily
consisted of acquiring restaurants from our franchisees and have been accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The primary intangible asset to which we have
generally allocated value in these business combinations is reacquired franchise rights.
We have determined that reacquired franchise rights do not meet the criteria of SFAS 141
to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill.

In 2001, the FASB also issued SFAS 142, which supersedes APB Opinion No.
17, "Intangible Assets." SFAS 142 eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with
a defined life, and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and
intangible assets. SFAS 142 applies to goodwill and intangible assets arising from
transactions completed before and after its effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for the
Company for fiscal year 2002.

If SFAS 142 had been effective for fiscal year 2001, the cessation of
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles would have resulted in our
reported net income being approximately $26 million higher. We have not yet determined
the impact of the transitional goodwill impairment test, which is required to be
performed in connection with to the adoption of SFAS 142.


In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), which will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year
2003. SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. We have not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS 143 on the
Company's Financial Statements.

In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144") which supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"
("SFAS 121") and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" for the
disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS 144 retains many of the fundamental provisions
of SFAS 121, but resolves certain implementation issues associated with that Statement.
SFAS 144 is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2002. We do not anticipate that the
adoption of SFAS 144 will have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Includes favorable  adjustments of $19 million in the U.S. and unfavorable  adjustments of $6 million in International related
     to our 1997 fourth quarter charge.  These  adjustments  primarily related to  lower-than-expected  losses from stores disposed of,
     decisions to retain certain  stores  originally  expected to be disposed of and changes in estimated  costs.  The original  fourth
     quarter 1997 charge included  estimates for the costs of closing stores;  reductions to fair market value,  less costs to sell, of
     the carrying  amounts of certain  restaurants we intended to refranchise;  and impairments of certain  restaurants  intended to be
     used in the business.

Includes  initial  franchise  fees in the U.S.  of $4 million  in 2001,  $17  million  in 2000 and $38  million in 1999 and in
     International of $3 million in both 2001 and 2000 and $7 million in 1999.  See Note 7.

In 2001, U.S.  refranchising  net (gains) included $12 million of previously  deferred  refranchising  gains and International
     refranchising  net losses  (gains)  included a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net assets of the  Singapore  business,
     which is held for sale.

Unusual items income in 2001 primarily included: (a) recoveries of
approximately $21 million related to the AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc. ("AmeriServe")
bankruptcy reorganization process; (b) aggregate settlement costs of $15 million
associated with certain litigation; and (c) expenses, primarily severance, related to
decisions to streamline certain support functions. See Note 22 for discussions of the
AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process and litigation.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded expenses of approximately $4
million related to streamlining certain support functions, which included the termination
of approximately 90 employees. The reserves established, which primarily related to
severance, were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of 2002.

Unusual items expense in 2000 included: (a) $170 million of charges and
direct incremental costs related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process; (b)
an increase in the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour litigation and
associated defense costs incurred in 2000; (c) costs associated with the formation of new
unconsolidated affiliates; and (d) the reversal of excess provisions arising from the
resolution of a dispute associated with the disposition of our Non-core Businesses, which
is discussed in Note 22.

Unusual items expense in 1999 included: (a) the write-off of
approximately $41 million owed to us by AmeriServe at the AmeriServe bankruptcy petition
date; (b) an increase in the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour
litigation and associated defense and other costs incurred in 1999; (c) favorable
adjustments to our 1997 fourth quarter charge; (d) the write-down to estimated fair
market value less cost to sell of our idle Wichita processing facility; (e) costs
associated with the formation of new unconsolidated affiliates; (f) the impairment of
enterprise-level goodwill in one of our international businesses; and (g) severance and
other exit costs related to strategic decisions to streamline the infrastructure of our
international business. The original fourth quarter 1997 charge included impairments of
certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates to be retained and costs of certain
personnel reductions.


Accounting Changes

In 1998 and 1999, we adopted several accounting and human resource policy
changes (collectively, the "accounting changes") which favorably impacted our 1999
operating results by approximately $29 million. The estimated impact is summarized below:

                      -------------------------------------------------------
                                             General and

                      ---------------    ------------------   ---------------
U.S.                  $        11        $         4          $        15
Unallocated                     -                 14                   14
                      ---------------    ------------------   ---------------
Total                 $        11        $        18          $        29
                      ===============    ==================   ===============

The accounting changes were as follows:

Effective December 27, 1998, we adopted Statement of Position 98-1 ("SOP
98-1"), "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use." Based on our adoption of SOP 98-1, we capitalized approximately $13 million of
internal software development costs and third party software costs in 1999. The
amortization of computer software assets that became ready for their intended use in 1999
was insignificant.

In addition, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-11 ("EITF
97-11"), "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions,"
upon its issuance in March 1998. In the first quarter of 1999, we also made a
discretionary policy change limiting the types of costs eligible for capitalization to
those direct cost types described as capitalizable under SOP 98-1. This change
unfavorably impacted our 1999 operating profit by approximately $3 million.

To conform to the Securities and Exchange Commission's April 23, 1998
interpretation of SFAS 121 our store closure accounting policy was changed in 1998.
Effective for closure decisions made on or subsequent to April 23, 1998, we recognize
store closure costs when we have closed the restaurant within the same quarter the
closure decision is made. When we decide to close a restaurant beyond the quarter in
which the closure decision is made, we review it for impairment. In fiscal year 1999,
this change resulted in additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $3
million through April 23, 1999.

In 1999, the methodology used by our independent actuary was refined and
enhanced to provide a more reliable estimate of the self-insured portion of our current
and prior years' ultimate loss projections related to workers' compensation, general
liability and automobile liability insurance programs. The change in methodology resulted
in a one-time increase in our 1999 operating profit of over $8 million.

At the end of 1998, we changed our method of determining the pension
discount rate to better reflect the assumed investment strategies we would most likely
use to invest any short-term cash surpluses. The pension discount methodology change
resulted in a one-time increase in our 1999 operating profit of approximately $6 million.

In 1999, our vacation policies were conformed to a calendar-year based,
earn-as-you-go, use-or-lose policy. The change provided a one-time favorable increase in
our 1999 operating profit of approximately $7 million. Other accounting policy
standardization changes by our three U.S. Concepts provided a one-time favorable increase
in our 1999 operating profit of approximately $1 million.

Our primary bank credit agreement, as amended, is comprised of a senior
unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility, which was reduced from $3 billion as part of the amendment discussed below
(collectively referred to as the "Credit Facilities"). The Credit Facilities mature on
October 2, 2002. Amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility are expected to
fluctuate, but Term Loan Facility reductions may not be reborrowed.


Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may borrow up to
the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December
29, 2001, we had unused Revolving Credit Facilities aggregating $2.7 billion, net of
outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 billion. We expensed facility fees on the Revolving
Credit Facility of approximately $4 million in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999.

Amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities at December 29, 2001 have
been classified as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the
October 2002 maturity. We are currently in negotiations to replace the Credit Facilities
prior to the maturity date with new borrowings, which will reflect the market conditions
and terms available at that time.

The Credit Facilities are subject to various covenants including
financial covenants relating to maintenance of specific leverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios. In addition, the Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative
covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness,
guarantees of indebtedness, cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain
other transactions, as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facilities require prepayment
of a portion of the proceeds from certain capital market transactions and refranchising
of restaurants.

Interest on amounts borrowed is payable at least quarterly at variable
rates, based principally on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a variable
margin factor. At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, the weighted average interest
rate on our variable rate debt was 3.4% and 7.2%, respectively, which includes the
effects of associated interest rate swaps. See Note 14 for a discussion of our use of
derivative instruments, our management of credit risk inherent in derivative instruments
and fair value information related to debt and interest rate swaps.

On February 22, 2002, we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms
of our Credit Facilities. This amendment provides for, among other things, additional
flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments. In addition, we
voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $3.0
billion to $1.75 billion. As a result of this amendment, we capitalized debt costs of
approximately $1.5 million. These costs will be amortized into interest expense over the
remaining life of the Credit Facilities.

In 1997, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission with respect to offerings of up to $2 billion of senior unsecured
debt. In May 1998, we issued $350 million of 7.45% Unsecured Notes due May 15, 2005
("2005 Notes") and $250 million of 7.65% Unsecured Notes due May 15, 2008 ("2008 Notes").
Interest on the 2005 Notes and 2008 Notes commenced on November 15, 1998 and is payable
semi-annually thereafter. The effective interest rate on the 2005 Notes and the 2008
Notes is 7.6% and 7.8%, respectively. In April 2001, we issued $200 million of 8.5%
Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2006 ("2006 Notes") and $650 million of 8.875%
Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2011 ("2011 Notes") (collectively referred to as the
"Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used to reduce amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Interest on the Notes is payable April 15 and
October 15 and commenced on October 15, 2001. The effective interest rate on the 2006
Notes and the 2011 Notes is 9.0% and 9.2%, respectively. We still have $550 million
available for issuance under the $2 billion shelf registration statement.

Interest expense on the short-term borrowings and long-term debt was $172
million, $190 million and $218 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net interest
expense of $9 million on incremental borrowings related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization process was included in unusual items in 2000.

The annual maturities of long-term debt through 2006 and thereafter,
excluding capital lease obligations and the derivative instrument adjustments, are 2002 -
$537 million; 2003 - $1 million; 2004 - $1 million; 2005 - $351 million; 2006 - $200
million and $900 million thereafter.


Note 13 - Leases

We have non-cancelable commitments under both capital and long-term
operating leases, primarily for our restaurants. Capital and operating lease commitments
expire at various dates through 2087 and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and
renewal options. Most leases require us to pay related executory costs, which include
property taxes, maintenance and insurance.

Future minimum commitments and amounts to be received as lessor or
sublessor under non-cancelable leases are set forth below:

Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of
stipulated amounts contained in the lease agreements.

During 2001, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving 17 of
our restaurants. Under the transactions, the restaurants were sold for approximately $18
million and have been leased back for initial terms of 15 years. These leasebacks have
been accounted for as operating leases. The future lease payments are included in the
above tables. Gains on the sales, which were not significant, were deferred and will be
amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the leases.


Note 14 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Instruments

Interest Rates

- We enter into interest rate swaps, collars and forward
rate agreements with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and
lowering interest expense for a portion of our debt. Under the contracts, we agree with
other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between variable rate
and fixed rate amounts calculated on a notional principal amount. At December 29, 2001
and December 30, 2000 we had outstanding pay-variable interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $350 million. These swaps have reset dates and floating rate indices which
match those of our underlying fixed-rate debt and have been designated as fair value
hedges of a portion of that debt. As the swaps qualify for the short-cut method under
SFAS 133 no ineffectiveness has been recorded. The fair value of these swaps as of
December 29, 2001 was approximately $36 million and has been included in Other assets.
The portion of this fair value which has not yet been recognized as a reduction to
interest expense (approximately $34 million at December 29, 2001) has been included in
Long-term debt.

At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, we also had outstanding
pay-fixed interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $650 million and $450 million,
respectively. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of a portion of our
variable-rate debt. As the critical terms of the swaps and hedged interest payments are
the same, we have determined that the swaps are completely effective in offsetting the
variability in cash flows associated with interest payments on that debt due to interest
rate fluctuations.

During 2000, we entered into interest rate collars to reduce interest
rate sensitivity on a portion of our variable rate bank debt. Interest rate collars
effectively lock in a range of interest rates by establishing a cap and floor. Reset
dates and the floating index on the collars match those of the underlying bank debt. If
interest rates remain within the collared cap and floor, no payments are made. If rates
rise above the cap level, we receive a payment. If rates fall below the floor level, we
make a payment. At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, we did not have any
outstanding interest rate collars.

Foreign Exchange

- We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with
the objective of reducing our exposure to cash flow volatility arising from foreign
currency fluctuations associated with certain foreign currency denominated financial
instruments, the majority of which are intercompany short-term receivables and payables.
The notional amount, maturity date, and currency of these contracts match those of the
underlying receivables or payables. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts
to reduce our cash flow volatility associated with certain forecasted foreign currency
denominated royalties. These forward contracts have historically been short-term in
nature, with termination dates matching forecasted settlement dates of the receivables or
payables or cash receipts from royalties within the next twelve months. For those foreign
currency exchange forward contracts that we have designated as cash flow hedges, we
measure ineffectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the forward contract with
the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. No
ineffectiveness was recognized in 2001 for those foreign currency forward contracts
designated as cash flow hedges.

Commodities

- We also utilize on a limited basis commodity futures and
options contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations over the next
twelve months. Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133. There
were no open commodity future and options contracts outstanding at December 29, 2001 and
those outstanding as of the adoption of SFAS 133 on December 31, 2000 were not
significant.

Deferred Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

- As of
December 29, 2001, we had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $1 million, net of tax. Of this amount, we estimate that a net after-tax
gain of less than $1 million will be reclassified into earnings through December 28,
2002. The remaining net after-tax loss of approximately $1 million, which arose from the
settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the issuance of certain amounts of our
fixed-rate debt, will be reclassified into earnings from December 29, 2002 through 2011
as an increase to interest expense on this debt.


Credit Risks

Our credit risk from the interest rate swap, collar and forward rate
agreements and foreign exchange contracts is dependent both on the movement in interest
and currency rates and possibility of non-payment by counterparties. We mitigate credit
risk by entering into these agreements with high-quality counterparties, netting swap and
forward rate payments within contracts and limiting payments associated with the collars
to differences outside the collared range.

Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from franchisees
and licensees for initial and continuing fees. In addition, we have notes and lease
receivables from certain of our franchisees. The financial condition of these franchisees
and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our Concepts.
This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the large number of
franchisees and licensees of each Concept and the short-term nature of the franchise and
license fee receivables.

Fair Value

At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, the fair values of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximated carrying value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The
fair value of notes receivable approximate carrying value after consideration of recorded
allowances.

Note 15 - Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

Pension Benefits

We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all full-time U.S. salaried employees, certain hourly employees and certain
international employees. During 2001, the TRICON Retirement Plan (the "Plan") was amended
such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by TRICON after September 30, 2001 will
not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Benefits are based on years of service and
earnings or stated amounts for each year of service.


Postretirement Medical Benefits

Our postretirement plan provides health care benefits, principally to
U.S. salaried retirees and their dependents. This plan includes retiree cost sharing
provisions. During 2001, the plan was amended such that any salaried employee hired or
rehired by TRICON after September 30, 2001 will not be eligible to participate in this plan.
Employees hired prior to September 30, 2001 are eligible for benefits if they meet
age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits.

The components of net periodic benefit cost are set forth below:

The assumptions used to compute the information above are set forth below:

We have assumed the annual increase in cost of postretirement medical
benefits was 8.0% for non-Medicare eligible retirees and 12.0% for Medicare eligible
retirees in 2001 and will be 7.5% and 11.0%, respectively, in 2002. We are assuming the
rates for non-Medicare and Medicare eligible retirees will decrease to an ultimate rate
of 5.5% by 2008 and 2010, respectively, and remain at that level thereafter. There is a
cap on our medical liability for certain retirees. The cap for Medicare eligible retirees
was reached in 2000 and the cap for non-Medicare eligible retirees is expected to be
reached between the years 2010-2012; once the cap is reached, our annual cost per retiree
will not increase.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for our postretirement health care plans. A one percent increase or
decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased or decreased
our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 29, 2001 by approximately
$3 million. The impact on our 2001 benefit cost would not have been significant.

Note 16 -Employee Stock-Based Compensation

At year-end 2001, we had four stock option plans in effect: the TRICON
Global Restaurants, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan ("1999 LTIP"), the 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan ("1997 LTIP"), the TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. Restaurant General
Manager Stock Option Plan ("YUMBUCKS") and the TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. SharePower
Plan ("SharePower").

We may grant awards of up to 7.6 million shares and 22.5 million shares
of stock under the 1999 LTIP and 1997 LTIP, respectively. Potential awards to employees
and non-employee directors under the 1999 LTIP include stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, restricted stock
units, performance shares and performance units. Potential awards to employees and
non-employee directors under the 1997 LTIP include stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock and performance restricted stock units. Prior to January 1, 2002, we also could
grant stock options and incentive stock options under the 1997 LTIP. We have issued only
stock options and performance restricted stock units under the 1997 LTIP and have issued
only stock options under the 1999 LTIP.

We may grant stock options under the 1999 LTIP to purchase shares at a
price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date of
grant. New option grants under the 1999 LTIP can have varying vesting provisions and
exercise periods. Previously granted options under the 1997 LTIP and 1999 LTIP vest in
periods ranging from immediate to 2006 and expire ten to fifteen years after grant.

We may grant options to purchase up to 7.5 million shares of stock under
YUMBUCKS at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the
date of grant. YUMBUCKS options granted have a four year vesting period and expire ten
years after grant. We may grant options to purchase up to 7.0 million shares of stock at
a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock under SharePower
on the date of grant. SharePower grants have not been made since Spin-off. Previously
granted SharePower options could be outstanding through 2006.


At the Spin-off Date, we converted certain of the unvested options to
purchase PepsiCo stock that were held by our employees to TRICON stock options under
either the 1997 LTIP or SharePower. We converted the options at amounts and exercise
prices that maintained the amount of unrealized stock appreciation that existed
immediately prior to the Spin-off. The vesting dates and exercise periods of the options
were not affected by the conversion. Based on their original PepsiCo grant date, our
converted options vest in periods ranging from one to ten years and expire ten to fifteen
years after grant.

The effects of applying SFAS 123 in the pro forma disclosures are not
likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma net income for future years
because variables such as the number of option grants, exercises and stock price
volatility included in these disclosures may not be indicative of future activity.

We estimated the fair value of each option grant made during 2001, 2000
and 1999 as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions:

In November 1997, we granted two awards of performance restricted stock
units of TRICON's Common Stock to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The awards were
made under the 1997 LTIP and may be paid in Common Stock or cash at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Payment of an award of $2.7 million was
contingent upon the CEO's continued employment through January 25, 2001 and our
attainment of certain pre-established earnings thresholds, as defined. In January 2001,
our CEO received a cash payment of $2.7 million following the Compensation Committee's
certification of TRICON's attainment of the pre-established earnings threshold. Payment
of an award of $3.6 million is contingent upon his employment through January 25, 2006
and our attainment of certain pre-established earnings thresholds, as defined. The annual
expense related to these awards included in earnings was $0.5 million for 2001 and $1.3
million for both 2000 and 1999.

During 2000 and 1999, modifications were made to certain 1997 LTIP and
SharePower options held by terminated employees. These modifications resulted in
additional compensation expense of an insignificant amount in 2000 and $5.0 million in
1999 with a corresponding increase in our Common Stock account.


Note 17 - Other Compensation and Benefit Programs

We sponsor two deferred compensation benefit programs, the Restaurant
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Executive Income Deferral Program (the "RDC Plan" and
the "EID Plan," respectively) for eligible employees and non-employee directors.

Effective October 1, 2001, participants can no longer defer funds into
the RDC Plan. Prior to that date, the RDC Plan allowed participants to defer a portion of
their annual salary. The participant's balances will remain in the RDC Plan until their
scheduled distribution dates. As defined by the RDC Plan, we credit the amounts deferred
with earnings based on the investment options selected by the participants. Investment
options in the RDC Plan consist of phantom shares of various mutual funds and TRICON
Common Stock. We recognize compensation expense for the appreciation or depreciation, if
any, attributable to all investments in the RDC Plan as well as for our matching
contribution. Our obligations under the RDC program as of the end of 2001 and 2000 were
$13 million and $10 million, respectively. We recognized annual compensation expense of
$3 million in 2001 and $1 million in both 2000 and 1999 for the RDC Plan.

The EID Plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their
annual salary and all or a portion of their incentive compensation. As defined by the EID
Plan, we credit the amounts deferred with earnings based on the investment options
selected by the participants. The EID Plan includes an investment option that allows
participants to defer incentive compensation to purchase phantom shares of our Common
Stock at a 25% discount from the average market price at the date of deferral (the
"Discount Stock Account"). Participants bear the risk of forfeiture of both the discount
and any amounts deferred if they voluntarily separate from employment during the two year
vesting period. We expense the intrinsic value of the discount over the vesting period.

We phased in certain program changes to the EID Plan during 1999 and
2000. These changes included limiting investment options, primarily to cash and phantom
shares of our Common Stock, and requiring the distribution of investments in the TRICON
Common Stock investment options to be paid in shares of our Common Stock. Due to these
changes, in 1998 we agreed to credit a one time premium to participant accounts on
January 1, 2000. The premium totaled approximately $3 million and was equal to 10% of the
participants' account balances as of December 31, 1999, excluding (a) investments in the
Discount Stock Account and (b) deferrals made in 1999.

Subsequent to January 1, 1999, we no longer recognize as compensation
expense the appreciation or depreciation, if any, attributable to investments in the
Discount Stock Account since these investments can only be settled in shares of our
Common Stock. We also reduced our liabilities by $21 million related to investments in
the Discount Stock Account and increased the Common Stock Account by the same amount at
January 1, 1999.

Subsequent to January 1, 2000, we no longer recognize as compensation
expense the appreciation or depreciation, if any, attributable to investments in the
phantom shares of our Common Stock, since these investments can only be settled in shares
of our Common Stock. For 1999, we recorded a benefit of $3 million related to
depreciation of investments in phantom shares of our Common Stock impacted by the January
2000 plan amendment. We also reduced our liabilities by $12 million related to
investments in the phantom shares of our Common Stock and increased the Common Stock
Account by the same amount at January 1, 2000.

Our cash obligations under the EID Plan as of the end of 2001 and 2000
were $24 million and $27 million, respectively. We recognized compensation expense of $4
million in 2001 and $6 million in both 2000 and 1999 for the EID Plan.


We sponsor a contributory plan to provide retirement benefits under the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "401(k) Plan") for
eligible full-time U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Participants may elect to
contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. Effective October 1,
2001 the 401(k) Plan was amended such that the Company matches 100% of the participant's
contribution up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the participant's contribution
on the next 2% of eligible compensation. Prior to this amendment, we made a discretionary
matching contribution equal to a predetermined percentage of each participant's
contribution to the TRICON Common Stock Fund. We determined our percentage match at the
beginning of each year based on the immediate prior year performance of our Concepts. All
matching contributions are made to the TRICON Common Stock Fund. We recognized as
compensation expense our total matching contribution of $5 million in 2001 and $4 million
in both 2000 and 1999.

Note 18 - Shareholders' Rights Plan

In July 1998, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of
one right for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of August 3, 1998 (the "Record
Date"). Each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase a unit consisting
of one one-thousandth of a share (a "Unit") of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, without par value, at a purchase price of $130 per Unit, subject to adjustment.
The rights, which do not have voting rights, will become exercisable for our Common Stock
ten business days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or
has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for, 15% or more, or 20% or more if
such person or group owned 10% or more on the adoption date of this plan, of our Common
Stock. In the event the rights become exercisable for Common Stock, each right will
entitle its holder (other than the Acquiring Person as defined in the Agreement) to
purchase, at the right's then-current exercise price, TRICON Common Stock having a value
of twice the exercise price of the right. In the event the rights become exercisable for
Common Stock and thereafter we are acquired in a merger or other business combination,
each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's then-current exercise
price, common stock of the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise price
of the right.

We can redeem the rights in their entirety, prior to becoming
exercisable, at $0.01 per right under certain specified conditions. The rights expire on
July 21, 2008, unless we extend that date or we have earlier redeemed or exchanged the
rights as provided in the Agreement.

This description of the rights is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Rights Agreement between TRICON and BankBoston, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of
July 21, 1998 (including the exhibits thereto).

Note 19 - Share Repurchase Program

In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase
program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through February 14, 2003, up to $300
million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock. During
2001, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for approximately $100 million at
an average price per share of approximately $42. Based on market conditions and other
factors, additional repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company.

In 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350
million (excluding applicable transaction fees), of our outstanding Common Stock. This
share repurchase program was completed in the second quarter of 2000. During 2000, we
repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares for $216 million at an average price per
share of $34. During 1999, we repurchased over 3.3 million shares for approximately $134
million at an average price of $40 per share.

Taxes payable were reduced by $13 million, $5 million and $14 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, as a result of stock option exercises. In addition,
goodwill and other intangibles were reduced by $8 million and $2 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively, as a result of the settlement of a disputed claim with the Internal
Revenue Service relating to the deductibility of reacquired franchise rights and other
intangibles. These reductions were offset by reductions in deferred and accrued taxes
payable.

In 2001, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain
states and foreign countries were reduced by $9 million ($6 million, net of federal tax)
and $6 million, respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more
likely than not that these assets will be utilized in the current and future years. In
2000, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign
countries were reduced by $35 million ($23 million, net of federal tax) and $6 million,
respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more likely than not that
these assets will be utilized in the current and future years. In 1999, valuation
allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain foreign countries were reduced by
$13 million for the same reason.

The deferred foreign tax provision for 2001 included a $2 million charge
to reflect the impact of changes in statutory tax rates in various countries. The impact
of statutory rate changes in foreign countries was less than $1 million in 2000. The 1999
deferred foreign provision included a benefit of $1 million.

Our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets decreased by $2
million in 2001 primarily due to the previously discussed change in circumstances,
partially offset by increases in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in
certain foreign countries and states.

A determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary
differences related to our investments in foreign subsidiaries and investments in foreign
unconsolidated affiliates that are essentially permanent in duration is not practicable.

We have available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 29, 2001 to reduce future tax of TRICON
and certain subsidiaries. The carryforwards are related to a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions. Of these carryforwards, $15 million expire in 2002 and $910 million expire
at various times between 2003 and 2020. The remaining carryforwards of approximately $150
million do not expire.


Note 21 - Reportable Operating Segments

We are engaged principally in developing, operating, franchising and
licensing the worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell concepts. KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell operate throughout the U.S. and in 84, 86 and 13 countries and territories outside
the U.S., respectively. Our five largest international markets based on operating profit
in 2001 are Australia, Canada, China, Korea and the United Kingdom. At December 29, 2001,
we had investments in 10 unconsolidated affiliates outside the U.S. which operate KFC
and/or Pizza Hut restaurants. These unconsolidated affiliates operate in Canada, China,
Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom.

We identify our operating segments based on management responsibility
within the U.S. and International. For purposes of applying SFAS No. 131 "Disclosure
About Segments of An Enterprise and Related Information" we consider our three U.S.
Concept operating segments to be similar and therefore have aggregated them into a single
reportable operating segment. Other than the U.S., no individual country represented 10%
or more of our total revenues, operating profit or assets.

Note 22 - Commitments and Contingencies

AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process

We and our franchisees and licensees are dependent on frequent
replenishment of the food ingredients and paper supplies required by our restaurants. We
and a large number of our franchisees and licensees operated under multi-year contracts,
which were assumed by McLane Company, Inc. ("McLane"), that had required the use of
AmeriServe to purchase and make deliveries of most of these supplies. AmeriServe filed
for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January 31, 2000. A plan
of reorganization for AmeriServe (the "POR") was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on
November 28, 2000.

During the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, we took a number
of actions to ensure continued supply to our system. These actions, resulted in a total
expense of $170 million which was recorded as unusual items in 2000. These costs included
the net funding of $70 million under a debtor-in possession revolving credit facility,
$59 million of net charges related to the global settlement with holders of allowed
secured and administrative priority claims in the bankruptcy and other costs of $41
million. The other costs included allowances for estimated uncollectible receivables
arising from supply sales to our franchisees and licensees under a temporary program. The
costs also included incremental interest expenses arising from the additional debt
required to finance inventory purchases and the receivables arising from these supply
sales. In 2001, we recorded unusual items income of $21 million related to net recoveries
of residual assets and certain preference claims under the POR. We will record additional
recoveries, if any, as unusual items as they are realized.


Other Commitments and Contingencies

Contingent Liabilities

We were directly or indirectly contingently liable in the amounts of $353
million and $401 million at year-end 2001 and 2000, respectively, for certain lease
assignments and guarantees. At December 29, 2001, $293 million represented contingent
liabilities to lessors as a result of assigning our interest in and obligations under
real estate leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants,
the contribution of certain Company restaurants to unconsolidated affiliates and
guarantees of certain other leases. The $293 million represented the present value of the
minimum payments of the assigned leases, excluding any renewal option periods, discounted
at our pre-tax cost of debt. On a nominal basis, the contingent liability resulting from
the assigned leases is $435 million.

The contingent liabilities also include guarantees of approximately $32.4
million to support financial arrangements of certain franchisees, including partial
guarantees of franchisee loan pools originated primarily in connection with the Company's
refranchising programs. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were
approximately $180 million at December 29, 2001. In support of these guarantees, we have
posted $32.4 million of letters of credit. Also, TRICON provides a standby letter of
credit under which TRICON could potentially be required to fund a portion (up to $25
million) of one of the franchisee loan pools. Any such funding under the standby letter
of credit would be secured by franchisee loan collateral. We believe that we have
appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent
liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to refranchising (gains) losses.

The remaining contingent liabilities of $28 million primarily related to
our guarantees of financial arrangements of certain unconsolidated affiliates and third
parties. These financial arrangements primarily include lines of credit, loans and
letters of credit. If all lines of credit and letters of credit were fully drawn down,
the maximum contingent liability under these arrangements would be approximately $56
million as of December 29, 2001.

Insurance Programs

We are currently self-insured for a portion of our current and prior
years' losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and automobile
liability insurance programs (collectively, "casualty loss(es)") as well as property
losses and certain other insurable risks. To mitigate the cost of our exposures for
certain property and casualty losses, we make annual decisions to either retain the risks
of loss up to certain maximum per occurrence or aggregate loss limits negotiated with our
insurance carriers or to fully insure those risks. Since the Spin-off, we have elected to
retain the risks subject to certain insured limitations. Effective August 16, 1999, we
made changes to our U.S. and portions of our International property and casualty
insurance programs. For fiscal years 2001, 2000 and the period from August 16, 1999
through the end of fiscal year 1999, we have bundled our risks for casualty losses,
property losses and various other insurable risks into one pool with a single
self-insured retention and have purchased reinsurance coverage up to a specified limit
which is significantly above our actuarially determined probable losses. We are
self-insured for losses in excess of the reinsurance limit. We believe the likelihood of
losses exceeding the reinsurance limit is remote. We are also self-insured for healthcare
claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and
limitations. We have accounted for our retained liabilities for property and casualty
losses and healthcare claims, including reported and incurred but not reported claims,
based on information provided by our independent actuaries.

Due to the inherent volatility of our property and actuarially determined
casualty loss estimates, it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in
estimated losses which could be material to our growth in quarterly and annual net
income. We believe that we have recorded our reserves for property and casualty losses at
a level which has substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of adverse
developments and/or volatility.


Change of Control Severance Agreements

In September 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved renewing severance agreements with certain key executives (the "Agreements")
that were set to expire on December 31, 2000. These Agreements are triggered by a
termination, under certain conditions, of the executive's employment following a change
in control of the Company, as defined in the Agreements. If triggered, the affected
executives would generally receive twice the amount of both their annual base salary and
their annual incentive in a lump sum, outplacement services and a tax gross-up for any
excise taxes. These Agreements have a three-year term and automatically renew each
January 1 for another three-year term unless the Company elects not to renew the
Agreements. Since the timing of any payments under these Agreements cannot be
anticipated, the amounts are not estimable. However, these payments, if made, could be
substantial. In the event of a change of control, rabbi trusts would be established and
used to provide payouts under existing deferred and incentive compensation plans.

Wage and Hour Litigation

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,
taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Like
certain other large retail employers, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have been faced in certain
states with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled

Bravo, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

("Bravo"), was filed in the Circuit Court
of the State of Oregon of the County of Multnomah. The lawsuit was filed by two former
Taco Bell shift managers purporting to represent approximately 17,000 current and former
hourly employees statewide. The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour laws,
principally involving unpaid wages including overtime, and rest and meal period
violations, and seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Under Oregon class action
procedures, Taco Bell was allowed an opportunity to "cure" the unpaid wage and hour
allegations by opening a claims process to all putative class members prior to
certification of the class. In this cure process, Taco Bell has paid out less than $1
million. On January 26, 1999, the Court certified a class of all current and former shift
managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged violations. A trial date
of November 2, 1999 was set. However, on November 1, 1999, the Court issued a proposed
order postponing the trial and establishing a pre-trial claims process. The final order
regarding the claims process was entered on January 14, 2000. Taco Bell moved for
certification of an immediate appeal of the Court-ordered claims process and requested a
stay of the proceedings. This motion was denied on February 8, 2000. Taco Bell appealed
this decision to the Supreme Court of Oregon and the Court denied Taco Bell's Writ of
Mandamus on March 21, 2000. A Court-approved notice and claim form was mailed to
approximately 14,500 class members on January 31, 2000. The Court ordered pre-trial
claims process went forward, and hearings to determine potential damages were held for
claimants employed or previously employed in four selected Taco Bell units. After the
initial hearings relating to these four units, the damage claims hearings were
discontinued. Trial began on January 4, 2001. On March 9, 2001, the jury reached verdicts
on the substantive issues in this matter. A number of these verdicts were in favor of the
Taco Bell position; however, certain issues were decided in favor of the plaintiffs. The
Court reduced the number of potential claimants to 1,100. A jury trial to determine the
damages of 93 of those claimants began on February 25, 2002, and is expected to last six
to eight weeks.

We have provided for the estimated costs of the Bravo litigation, based
on a projection of eligible claims (including claims filed to date, where applicable),
the cost of each eligible claim, the estimated legal fees incurred by plaintiffs and the
results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters.
Although the outcome of this case cannot be determined at this time, we believe the
ultimate cost of this case in excess of the amounts already provided will not be material
to our annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Any provisions
have been recorded as unusual items.


On May 11, 1998, a purported class action lawsuit against Pizza Hut,
Inc., and one of its franchisees, PacPizza, LLC, entitled

Aguardo, et al. v. Pizza Hut,
Inc., et al.,

("Aguardo"), was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California of
the County of San Francisco. The lawsuit was filed by three former Pizza Hut restaurant
general managers purporting to represent approximately 1,300 current and former
California restaurant general managers of Pizza Hut and PacPizza, LLC. The lawsuit
alleged violations of state wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and
vacation pay and sought an unspecified amount in damages. On January 12, 2000, the Court
certified a class of approximately 1,300 current and former restaurant general managers.
The Court amended the class on June 1, 2000 to include approximately 150 additional
current and former restaurant general managers. On May 2, 2001, the parties reached an
agreement to settle this matter and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the
case. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on September 27, 2001, and
final approval of the settlement on December 20, 2001. As no objections to the settlement
were made, the Court's order approving the settlement and dismissing with prejudice all
claims is final and non-appealable. We have provided for the costs of this settlement as
unusual items.

On October 2, 1996, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,
entitled

Mynaf, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.,

was filed in the Superior Court of the State
of California of the County of Santa Clara. The lawsuit was filed by two former
restaurant general managers and two former assistant restaurant general managers
purporting to represent all current and former Taco Bell restaurant general managers and
assistant restaurant general managers in California. The lawsuit alleged violations of
California wage and hour laws involving unpaid overtime wages and violations of the State
Labor Code's record-keeping requirements. The complaint also included an unfair business
practices claim. Plaintiffs claimed individual damages ranging from $10,000 to $100,000
each. On September 17, 1998, the court certified a class of approximately 3,000 current
and former assistant restaurant general managers and restaurant general managers. Taco
Bell petitioned the appellate court to review the trial court's certification order. The
petition was denied on December 31, 1998. Taco Bell then filed a petition for review with
the California Supreme Court, and the petition was subsequently denied. Class notices
were mailed on August 31, 1999 to over 3,400 class members. Trial began on January 29,
2001. Before conclusion of the trial, the parties reached an agreement to settle this
matter, and entered into a stipulation of discontinuance of the case. This settlement
agreement was approved by the court on September 21, 2001. We have provided for the costs
of this settlement as unusual items.

Other Litigation

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled

Wrench
LLC, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

("Wrench") was filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit alleges
that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising
featuring a Chihuahua. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages under several theories,
including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea misappropriation, conversion and
unfair competition. On June 10, 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment in
favor of Taco Bell Corp. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit (the "Court of Appeals"), and oral arguments were held on September 20,
2000. On July 6, 2001, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment in
favor of Taco Bell Corp. and remanded the case to the District Court. Taco Bell Corp.
unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on January 21, 2002.
The case has now officially been returned to the District Court, where the Wrench
plaintiffs will be allowed to bring their claims to trial.

We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs' claims are without merit and are
vigorously defending the case. However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time. Likewise, the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.


C&F Packing Co.,  Inc. v. Pizza Hut,  Inc.

This action was  originally  filed in 1993 by C&F Packing Co.,  Inc., a Chicago meat packing
company  ("C&F"),  in the United  States  District  Court for the Northern  District of Illinois.  This lawsuit  alleges that Pizza Hut
misappropriated  various trade secrets relating to C&F's alleged process for  manufacturing a precooked  Italian sausage pizza topping.
C&F's trade secret claims  against  Pizza Hut were  originally  dismissed by the trial court on statute of  limitations  grounds.  That
ruling was later  overturned  by the U.S.  Court of Appeals  for the Federal  Circuit in August  2000 and the case was  remanded to the
trial court for further  proceedings.  On remand,  Pizza Hut moved for summary  judgment on its statute of  limitations  defense.  That
motion was denied in January  2001.  This lawsuit was scheduled for trial in late January  2002.  Prior to trial,  the parties  entered
into a written  settlement  agreement  pursuant to which C&F agreed to dismiss the case in exchange  for a lump sum payment  from Pizza
Hut.  This  payment has been made and the case was  dismissed  with  prejudice  effective  February 6, 2002.  We have  provided for the
costs of this settlement as unusual items in 2001.

Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into separation and other
related agreements (the "Separation Agreements"), governing the Spin-off transaction and
our subsequent relationship with PepsiCo. These agreements provide certain indemnities to
PepsiCo.

The Separation Agreements provided for, among other things, our
assumption of all liabilities relating to the restaurant businesses, including California
Pizza Kitchen, Chevys Mexican Restaurant, D'Angelo's Sandwich Shops, East Side Mario's
and Hot 'n Now (collectively the "Non-core Businesses"), and our indemnification of
PepsiCo with respect to these liabilities. We have included our best estimates of these
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, we have indemnified PepsiCo for any costs or losses it
incurs with respect to all letters of credit, guarantees and contingent liabilities
relating to our businesses under which PepsiCo remains liable. As of December 29, 2001,
PepsiCo remains liable for approximately $94 million on a nominal basis related to these
contingencies. This obligation ends at the time PepsiCo is released, terminated or
replaced by a qualified letter of credit. We have not been required to make any payments
under this indemnity.

Under the Separation Agreements, PepsiCo maintains full control and
absolute discretion with regard to any combined or consolidated tax filings for periods
through October 6, 1997. PepsiCo also maintains full control and absolute discretion
regarding any common tax audit issues. Although PepsiCo has contractually agreed to, in
good faith, use its best efforts to settle all joint interests in any common audit issue
on a basis consistent with prior practice, there can be no assurance that determinations
made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach, acting on our own behalf. Through
December 29, 2001, there have not been any determinations made by PepsiCo where we would
have reached a different determination.

We also agreed to certain restrictions on our actions to help ensure that
the Spin-off maintained its tax-free status. These restrictions, which were generally
applicable to the two-year period following October 6, 1997, included among other things,
limitations on any liquidation, merger or consolidation with another company, certain
issuances and redemptions of our Common Stock, our granting of stock options and our
sale, refranchising, distribution or other disposition of assets. If we failed to abide
by these restrictions or to obtain waivers from PepsiCo and, as a result, the Spin-off
fails to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, we may be obligated to indemnify PepsiCo
for any resulting tax liability, which could be substantial. No payments under these
indemnities have been required or are expected to be required. Additionally, PepsiCo is
entitled to the federal income tax benefits related to the exercise after the Spin-off of
vested PepsiCo options held by our employees. We expense the payroll taxes related to the
exercise of these options as incurred.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other information included in
this annual report. The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include certain amounts
based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. Other financial information
presented in the annual report is derived from the financial statements.

We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting,
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The
system is supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of
Conduct program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal
and professional integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the
adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate actions are
taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving
the system as they are identified.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited and reported on
by our independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and
Committees of the Board. We believe that management representations made to the
independent auditors were valid and appropriate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely
of outside directors, provides oversight to our financial reporting process and our
controls to safeguard assets through periodic meetings with our independent auditors,
internal auditors and management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors
have free access to the Audit Committee.

Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all
errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 29, 2001 provide
reasonable assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors

TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TRICON
Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("TRICON") as of December 29, 2001 and December
30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders'
equity (deficit) and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 29, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of TRICON's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TRICON as of December
29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2000 Incentive Buy-Out

You will  receive  a  one-time  payment  of  $430,000  (gross  before  taxes) to compensate you for the  forfeiture of your 2000  incentive  from Domino's.  This
will be paid to you within approximately 30 days following the Start Date.

2001 Incentive

This position  carries a target bonus of 75% of base salary.  For 2001,  you are guaranteed  a minimum of 100% of  target.  In the event you  voluntarily  resign
within  twelve  months  of your  start  date,  you  agree  that  you will not be entitled to any 2001  incentive  payment and if it is paid,  you agree to return
it  immediately.  The 2001  bonus is  payable  in early  2002  during the normal bonus process.  Additionally, you are eligible to receive any upside earned as a
result  of  individual  and  KFC   performance  for  the  period  of  time  from commencement  of your  employment to the end of the year, in accordance with the
provisions of our annual incentive program.

Hiring Bonus

We will pay you a hiring  bonus in the amount of  $75,000  (after  taxes).  This hiring  bonus is payable  within two (2) weeks of the Start Date.  You may elect
to defer this bonus into Tricon stock in our Executive Income Deferral  program, provided  you  notify us before or at the time you  accept  this  offer.  In the
event that you  voluntarily  resign  without Good Reason within twelve months of the Start Date,  you agree to repay this hiring  bonus  immediately.  Otherwise,
this hiring bonus is not subject to any repayment requirement.

Stock Option Program

You will be eligible for the Tricon Stock  Option  Grant  Program in 2001.  Your 2001 face value award amount is $2,000,000  and will be granted on the executive
grant date of January 25, 2001,  provided your  commencement of employment is on or  before  that  date,  and  otherwise  will be  granted  as soon as  practical
thereafter.  This first  grant will have 25% per year  vesting  and an  exercise price equal to the  date-of-grant  market  price.  You will also receive a grant
of 31,250  stock  options on the grant  date  described  above.  This grant will vest  100%  four (4) years  from the date of grant  and have an  exercise  price

guideline will be 24,000 shares. You have five years to achieve this  guideline  and need to reach an annual 20%  commitment to be eligible  for our  ownership  stock  option  grants.  You are not required to
meet the guideline  trend for the first stock option grant in 2001,  but will be required to be 20% on trend for the 2002 grant.

Income Deferral

You will be eligible to participate in Tricon's  Executive Income Deferral (EID) Plan.  Under  EID,  you may  voluntarily  elect to  defer  up to 100% of  salary
and/or annual incentive.  For your incentive deferrals,  Tricon stock is offered at a 25% discount to fair market value,  subject to a risk of forfeiture  should
you  voluntarily  leave KFC or Tricon  within two years of your  deferral.  This program can be utilized to meet your ownership requirements.

Change in Control Agreement

You  will  receive  a change  in  control  agreement  similar  to  other  Tricon Executives.  Your payment under the agreement in case of  termination on account

Included in earnings  for 1997 are certain  allocations  related to overhead  costs and  interest  expense
   from PepsiCo.  For purposes of these ratios,  earnings are  calculated  by adding to  (subtracting  from) pretax
   income  from  continuing  operations  before  income  taxes and  cumulative  effect of  accounting  changes  the
   following:  fixed charges,  excluding capitalized interest; (equity income (loss) from unconsolidated  affiliates);  and distributed income from unconsolidated  affiliates.
   Fixed charges  consist of interest on  borrowings,  the  allocation of PepsiCo's  interest  expense for 1997 and
   that portion of rental expense that approximates interest.

Included the impact of unusual items (income) expense of $(3) million in 2001, $204  million in 2000, $51 million in 1999,  $15 million in 1998,  and $184 million in 1997.  Excluding the impact of
   these unusual items,  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 3.73x, 4.16x, 4.49x, 2.92x, and 1.36x for
   the fiscal years ended 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

For  the  fiscal  year  ended December  27,  1997,   earnings  were  insufficient  to  cover  fixed  charges  by
   approximately  $38 million.  Earnings in 1997 included a charge of $530 million taken
   in the fourth quarter to refocus our business.
