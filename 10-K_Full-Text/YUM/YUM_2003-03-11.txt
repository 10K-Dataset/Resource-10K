Business.

YUM! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM” or the “Company”),
formerly known as TRICON Global Restaurants,  Inc., was  incorporated  under the laws of
the state of North  Carolina in 1997. The principal  executive  offices of YUM are
located  at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky  40213, and its telephone number at
that location is (502) 874-8300.

YUM, the  registrant,  together with its restaurant  operating  companies and other
subsidiaries,  is referred to in this  Form 10-K  annual  report  (“Form  10-K”)
as the  Company.  Prior to October 6, 1997,  the  business  of the  Company  was
conducted by PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”) through various subsidiaries and
divisions.

This Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statements on pages
39 and 40.

(a)

General
Development of Business

In January 1997,  PepsiCo  announced its decision to spin-off its restaurant
businesses to shareholders as an independent  public  company  (the  “Spin-off”).
Effective  October  6,  1997,  PepsiCo  disposed  of  its  restaurant  businesses  by
distributing all of the outstanding  shares of common stock of YUM to its  shareholders.
YUM’s Common Stock began trading  on the New York Stock  Exchange on October 7, 1997
under the symbol  “YUM.” Prior to that date,  from  September  17, 1997
through October 6, 1997, YUM’s Common Stock was traded on the New York Stock
Exchange on a “when-issued” basis.

On May 7, 2002, YUM completed the  acquisition  of Yorkshire  Global  Restaurants,
Inc.  (“YGR”),  the parent company and  operator of Long John Silver’s  (“LJS”)
and A&W All-American  Food Restaurants  (“A&W”). Additionally,  on May 16, 2002,
following  receipt of shareholder  approval,  the Company  changed its name from TRICON
Global  Restaurants,  Inc. to YUM!  Brands, Inc.

As used in this Form 10-K,  references to YUM or the Company  include the historical
operating  results of the businesses  and  operations  transferred  to the  Company in
the  Spin-off  and since May 7, 2002,  acquired  from YGR.  Additionally,  throughout
this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are
used interchangeably.

(b)

Financial
Information about Operating Segments

YUM consists of five operating segments:  KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS/A&W and YUM
Restaurants  International  (“YRI” or  “International”).  For
financial reporting purposes,  management  considers the four U.S. operating segments to
be similar  and,  therefore,  has aggregated them into a single reportable  operating
segment.  Operating segment  information for the  years ended  December  28,  2002,
December  29, 2001 and  December  30, 2000 for the Company is included in  Management’s
Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations  (“MD&A”) in
Part II, Item 7, pages 17 through  39 and in the related Consolidated Financial
Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 41 through 79.

Narrative
Description of Business

General

YUM is the world’s largest quick service  restaurant  (“QSR”) company based
on number of system units,  with nearly 33,000  units in over 100  countries  and
territories.  The YUM  organization  is currently  made up of six  operating  companies
organized around five restaurant  concepts  including its three original  concepts,  KFC,
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and two  acquired  concepts,  LJS and A&W (the  “Concepts”).
The six operating  companies are KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell,  LJS, A&W and YRI.


Restaurant Concepts

Through its five Concepts,  the Company  develops,  operates,  franchises  and
licenses a worldwide  system of restaurants  which  prepare,  package and sell a menu of
competitively  priced  food  items.  These  restaurants  are  operated by the  Company
or, under the terms of franchise or license  agreements,  by  franchisees or licensees
who are  independent  third  parties, or by affiliates in which we own a non-controlling
equity interest (“Unconsolidated Affiliates”).

In each  Concept,  consumers  can dine in  and/or  carry  out food.  In  addition,
Taco  Bell,  KFC,  LJS and A&W offer a  drive-thru  option in many stores.  Pizza Hut
offers a drive-thru  option on a much more limited basis.  Pizza Hut and, on  a much more
limited basis, KFC offer delivery service.

Each Concept has proprietary  menu items and emphasizes the  preparation of food with
high quality  ingredients as well as  unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices.

The  franchise  program of the Company is designed to assure  consistency  and
quality,  and the Company is  selective in  granting  franchises.  Under  the  standard
franchise  agreement,  franchisees  supply  capital – initially  by paying a
franchise fee to YUM, purchasing or leasing the land and building and purchasing
equipment,  signs,  seating,  inventories  and supplies and, over the longer term, by
reinvesting  in the  business.  Franchisees  then  contribute to the Company’s
revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales.

The Company  believes  that it is important  to maintain  strong and open
relationships  with its  franchisees  and their  representatives.  To this end, the
Company  invests a  significant  amount of time working with the  franchisee  community
and their representative  organizations on all aspects of the business,  including new
products,  equipment and management  techniques.

The Company is actively  pursuing  the  strategy of  multibranding,  where two or more
of its  Concepts  are operated in a  single unit.  In addition,  the Company is testing
multibranding  options  involving one of its Concepts and a restaurant  concept not owned
by or affiliated with YUM. By combining two or more restaurant  concepts,  particularly
those that have  complementary  daypart  strengths in one  location,  the Company
believes it can generate  higher sales volumes from such  units,  significantly  improve
returns on per unit  investment,  and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater number
of  trade areas  throughout the U.S. and  internationally.  Through the  consolidation of
market planning  initiatives  across  all of its  Concepts,  the  Company has
established,  or is in the  process of  establishing  in the case of LJS and A&W, multi-year
development plans by trade area to optimize  franchise and company  penetration of its
Concepts and to improve  returns on its existing asset base. The development of
multibranded  units may be limited,  in some  instances,  by prior  development and/or
territory rights granted to franchisees.

At year-end  2002,  there were 1,975  multibranded  units in the  worldwide  system.
These units were  comprised of 1,918  units  offering  food  products  from two of the
Concepts (a “2n1”),  51 units  offering  food  products from three of the
Concepts (a “3n1”) and 6 units  offering food  products from one of the
Concepts and a restaurant  concept not owned by or  affiliated with YUM.

Restaurant Operations

Through its Concepts,  YUM develops,  operates,  franchises and licenses a system of
both traditional and  non-traditional  QSR restaurants.  Traditional  units feature
dine-in,  carryout and, in some instances,  drive-thru or delivery  services.
Non-traditional  units, which are typically  licensed outlets,  include express units and
kiosks which have a more limited  menu and operate in  non-traditional  locations like
malls,  airports,  gasoline  service  stations,  convenience  stores,  stadiums,
amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be
practical or efficient.


The Company’s  restaurant  management  structure varies by concept and unit size.
Generally,  each Company  restaurant is  led by a restaurant  general manager  (“RGM”),
together with one or more assistant  managers,  depending on the operating  complexity
and sales volume of the restaurant.  Each restaurant  usually has between 10 and 35
hourly  employees,  most of  whom work  part-time.  The Company’s six operating
companies  each issue detailed  manuals  covering all aspects of their  respective
operations,  including food handling and product preparation procedures,  safety and
quality issues,  equipment  maintenance,  facility standards and accounting control
procedures.  The restaurant  management teams are responsible for  the day-to-day
operation of each unit and for ensuring  compliance  with operating  standards.  CHAMPS
– which stands for  Cleanliness,  Hospitality,  Accuracy,  Maintenance,  Product
Quality and Speed of Service – is our core systemwide program  for training,
measuring and rewarding employee  performance  against key customer  measures.  CHAMPS is
intended to align  the operating  processes of our entire system around one set of
standards.  RGMs’ efforts,  including  CHAMPS  performance  measures,  are monitored
by area managers or market  coaches.  Market  coaches  typically work with  approximately
six to  twelve  restaurants.  The Company’s  restaurants are visited from time to time by
various senior  operators to help ensure  adherence to system standards and mentor
restaurant team members.

RGMs attend and complete their  respective  operating  company’s  required  training
programs.  These programs consist of  initial  training,  as well as additional
continuing  development  and training  programs that may be offered or required  from
time to time.  Initial  manager  training  programs  generally  last at least six  weeks
and  emphasize  leadership,  business  management,  supervisory  skills  (including
training,  coaching,  and  recruiting),  product  preparation  and  production, safety,
quality control, customer service, labor management, and equipment maintenance.

Following is a brief description of each Concept:

KFC

KFC was founded in Corbin,  Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders,  an early developer of the quick service food
     business and a pioneer of the restaurant  franchise  concept.  The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and
     spices for Kentucky  Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first  franchisee in 1952.  KFC is based in  Louisville,
     Kentucky.

As of year-end  2002, KFC was the leader in the U.S.  chicken QSR segment among  companies  featuring  chicken as
     their primary  product  offering,  with a 46 percent  market share in that segment which is nearly four times that of
     its closest national competitor.

KFC operates in 88 countries and  territories  throughout the world.  As of year-end 2002, KFC had 5,472 units in
     the U.S.,  and 6,890  units  outside  the U.S.  Approximately  23  percent  of the U.S.  units and 22  percent of the
     non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

While  product  offerings  vary  throughout  the  worldwide  system,  traditional  KFC  restaurants  offer  fried
     chicken-on-the-bone  products,  primarily  marketed  under the names  Original  Recipe and Extra Tasty Crispy.  Other
     principal entree items include chicken sandwiches (including the Twister),  Colonel’s Crispy Strips,  Popcorn Chicken
     and,  seasonally,  Chunky Chicken Pot Pies.  KFC  restaurants  also offer a variety of side items,  such as biscuits,
     mashed  potatoes and gravy,  coleslaw,  corn,  Potato Wedges (in the U.S.) and french fries (outside of the U.S.), as
     well as desserts.  Restaurant  decor is characterized by the image of the Colonel,  and KFC’s  distinctive  packaging
     includes the “Bucket” of chicken.

Pizza Hut

The first Pizza Hut restaurant  was opened in 1958 in Wichita,  Kansas,  and within a year,  the first  franchise
     unit was  opened.  Today,  Pizza  Hut is the  largest  restaurant  chain  in the  world  specializing  in the sale of
     ready-to-eat pizza products.  Pizza Hut is based in Dallas, Texas.


As of year-end 2002,  Pizza Hut was the leader in the U.S.  pizza QSR segment,  with a 15 percent market share in
     that segment.

Pizza Hut operates in 85 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2002,  Pizza Hut had
     7,599  units in the U.S.,  and 4,431  units  outside of the U.S.  Approximately  23 percent of the U.S.  units and 18
     percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

Pizza Hut  features a variety of pizzas,  which may include Pan Pizza,  Thin ‘n Crispy,  Hand  Tossed,  Sicilian,
     Stuffed Crust,  Twisted Crust, The Big New Yorker,  The Insider and The Chicago Dish. Each of these pizzas is offered
     with a variety of different  toppings.  In some restaurants,  Pizza Hut also offers  breadsticks,  pasta,  salads and
     sandwiches.  The distinctive Pizza Hut image typically features a bright red roof.

Taco Bell

The first Taco Bell  restaurant  was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey,  California,  and in 1964,  the first
     Taco Bell franchise was sold.  Taco Bell is based in Irvine, California.

As of year-end  2002,  Taco Bell was the leader in the U.S.  Mexican QSR segment,  with a 65 percent market share
     in that segment.

Taco Bell operates in 12 countries and territories  throughout the world.  As of year-end 2002,  there were 6,165
     Taco Bell units in the U.S.,  and 267 units  outside of the U.S.  Approximately  21 percent of the U.S.  units and 14
     percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

Taco Bell specializes in  Mexican-style  food products,  including  various types of tacos,  burritos,  gorditas,
     chalupas,  quesadillas,  salads,  nachos and other  related  items.  Additionally,  proprietary  entreè items include
     Grilled Stuft Burritos and Border Bowls.  Taco Bell units feature a distinctive bell logo on their signage.

LJS

The first LJS  restaurant  opened in 1969 and the first LJS  franchise  unit opened  later the same year.  LJS is
     presently  based  in  Lexington,  Kentucky;  however,  the  Company  has  announced  its  intention  to move  the LJS
     headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky in 2003.

As of year-end 2002, LJS was the leader in the U.S.  seafood QSR segment,  with a 33 percent market share in that
     segment.

LJS operates in 5 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2002,  there were 1,221 LJS
     units in the U.S.,  and 28 units  outside the U.S.  Approximately  61 percent of the U.S.  units are  operated by the
     Company.  All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees.

LJS features a variety of seafood items,  including  meals  featuring  batter-dipped  fish,  chicken,  shrimp and
     hushpuppies.  LJS units typically feature a distinctive seaside/nautical theme.

A&W

A&W was founded in Lodi,  California  by Roy Allen in 1919 and the first A&W franchise  unit opened in 1925.  A&W
     is  presently  based in  Lexington,  Kentucky;  however,  the Company has  announced  its  intention  to move the A&W
     headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky in 2003.


A&W operates in 17 countries  and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2002,  there were 665 A&W
      units in the U.S.,  and 182 units outside the U.S.  Approximately  19 percent of the U.S.  units are operated by the
      Company.  All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees.

A&W  serves  A&W  draft  Root  Beer and a  signature  A&W Root  Beer  float,  as well as  all-American  pure-beef
     hamburgers and hot dogs.

International

The  international  operations of the five Concepts are consolidated into a separate
operating  company (YRI),  which has  directed its focus toward franchise system growth
and  concentration of Company  development in those markets in which the  Company
believes  sufficient  scale is  achievable.  YRI has  developed  global  systems  and
tools  designed  to improve  marketing,  operations  consistency,  product delivery,
market planning and development and franchise support capability.  YRI is based in
Dallas, Texas.

As of year-end  2002,  YRI had 11,798  units.  Approximately  20 percent of these
units are  operated by the  Company.  In  2002, YRI accounted for 35 percent of the
Company’s total system sales and 31 percent of the Company’s revenues.

Operating Structure

In all five of its  Concepts,  the Company  either  operates  units or they are
operated by  independent  franchisees  or  licensees.  Franchisees can range in size from
individuals  owning just a few units to large publicly  traded  companies.  In  addition,
the  Company  owns  non-controlling  interests  in  Unconsolidated  Affiliates  who
operate  similar  to  franchisees.  As of year-end  2002,  approximately  23 percent of
YUM’s  worldwide  units were  operated  by the  Company,  approximately  63  percent
by  franchisees,  approximately  8  percent  by  licensees  and  approximately  6
percent  by  Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Supply and Distribution

The Company is a substantial  purchaser of a number of food and paper products,
equipment and other restaurant  supplies.  The principal items purchased include beef,
cheese, chicken products,  seafood,  cooking oils, corn, flour, lettuce, paper  and
packaging materials, pinto beans, pork, seasonings, certain beverage products and tomato
products.

Effective as of March 1, 1999, the Company, along with the KFC National Purchasing
Cooperative,  Inc. and representatives  of the Company’s KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell franchisee  groups,  formed the Unified  FoodService  Purchasing  Co-op, LLC  (the
“Unified  Co-op”) for the purpose of  purchasing  certain  restaurant  products
and equipment in the U.S. The Company  has also  substantially  integrated the purchasing
activities for LJS and A&W into the Unified Co-op. The core mission of  the Unified
Co-op is to provide the lowest  possible  sustainable  store-delivered  prices for
restaurant  products  and  equipment.  This  arrangement  combines the purchasing  power
of the Company and franchisee  restaurants in the U.S. which  the Company  believes will
further  leverage the system’s scale to drive cost savings and  effectiveness in the
purchasing  function.  The Company  also  believes  that the Unified  Co-op has
resulted,  and should  continue to result,  in closer  alignment of interests and a
stronger relationship with its franchisee community.

To  ensure  the  wholesomeness  of food  products,  suppliers  are  required  to meet
or  exceed  strict  quality  control  standards.  Long-term  contracts and long-term
vendor  relationships  are used to ensure  availability  of products.  The  Company has
not experienced any significant  continuous  shortages of supplies,  and alternative
sources for most of these  products are generally  available.  Prices paid for these
supplies may be subject to  fluctuation.  When prices  increase,  the Company may be able
to pass on such  increases to its  customers,  although  there is no assurance this can
be done in  the future.


Most food products,  paper and packaging  supplies,  and equipment used in the
operation of the Company’s  restaurants are  distributed  to  individual  restaurant
units by third party  distribution  companies.  Since  November 30, 2000,  McLane
Company, Inc. (“McLane”),  a subsidiary of Wal-Mart,  has been the exclusive
distributor for Company-operated  KFCs, Pizza  Huts and Taco Bells in the U.S.  and for a
substantial  number of  franchisee  and  licensee  stores.  McLane  became the
distributor when it assumed all supply and distribution  responsibilities  under an
existing  agreement between AmeriServe  Food  Distribution,  Inc.  (“AmeriServe”)
and the Company (the  “AmeriServe  Agreement”).  McLane  assumed the AmeriServe
Agreement,  as amended,  as well as distribution  agreements covering a substantial
portion of the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  franchise  system,  and,  to a  lesser  extent,
the KFC  franchise  system  simultaneously  with its  acquisition  of the  AmeriServe
business.  The AmeriServe  business was acquired by McLane after AmeriServe filed for
protection under Chapter  11 of the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code and a plan of  reorganization
for  AmeriServe  (the  “POR”)  was  approved  by the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court on
November 28, 2000. A discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization  process on  the Company is contained in Note 25 to the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  on page 78. In  connection  with McLane’s  acquisition and
assumption of the AmeriServe Agreement,  the Company agreed to certain amendments,
including an extension  of the AmeriServe  Agreement  through  October 31, 2010.  Under
the terms of the Agreement  with McLane,  Company-operated  KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
restaurants in the U.S.  generally cannot use alternative  distributors.  The Company
stores  within the LJS system are covered under a separate agreement with McLane. A&W units
are not currently serviced by McLane.

YRI and its franchisees use decentralized  sourcing and distribution  systems
involving many different global,  regional,  and local  suppliers  and  distributors.  In
certain  countries,  including  China,  YRI may own all or a portion  of the
distribution system.

Trademarks and Patents

The Company and its Concepts own numerous  registered  trademarks  and service  marks.
The Company  believes that many of  these marks,  including its Kentucky Fried  Chicken®,
KFC®,  Pizza Hut®, Taco Bell® and Long John Silver’s® marks,  have
significant  value and are materially  important to its business.  The Company’s  policy
is to pursue  registration of its  important  marks whenever  feasible and to oppose
vigorously  any  infringement  of its marks.  The Company also licenses  certain
trademarks and service marks,  including certain of the A&W trademarks and service marks
(the “A&W Marks”),  which  are owned by A&W Concentrate Company (formerly A&W Brands,
Inc.). A&W Concentrate  Company,  which is not affiliated with  the Company,  has granted
the Company an exclusive,  worldwide (excluding Canada),  perpetual,  royalty-free
license (with  right to sublicense) to use the A&W Marks for restaurant services.

The use of these marks by  franchisees  and  licensees  has been  authorized  in KFC,
Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell,  LJS and A&W franchise  and  license  agreements.  Under  current
law and with  proper  use,  the  Company’s  rights  in its marks can  generally last
indefinitely.  The Company also has certain patents on restaurant  equipment  which,
while valuable,  are  not material to its business.

Working Capital

Information  about the  Company’s  working  capital is  included  in MD&A in Part
II,  Item 7, pages 17 through 39 and the  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part
II, Item 8, pages 41 through 79.

Customers

The Company’s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of
customers.

Seasonal Operations

The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.


Backlog Orders

Company restaurants have no backlog orders.

Government Contracts

No material  portion of the  Company’s  business is subject to  renegotiation  of
profits or  termination  of contracts or  subcontracts at the election of the U.S.
government.

Competition

The overall food service  industry and the QSR segment are  intensely  competitive
with respect to food  quality,  price,  service,  convenience,  restaurant location and
concept.  The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer  tastes;
national,  regional or local economic conditions;  currency  fluctuations;  demographic
trends; traffic patterns;  the type,  number and location of competing  restaurants;  and
disposable  purchasing  power. Each of the Concepts compete  with national and regional
chains as well as locally-owned  restaurants,  not only for customers,  but also for
management  and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.

Research and Development (“R&D”)

The Company  operates  R&D facilities  in  Louisville,  Kentucky;  Dallas,  Texas;
Irvine,  California;  and  Lexington,  Kentucky.  The  Company  expensed  $23 million in
2002,  $23  million in 2001 and $24 million in 2000 for R&D activities.  From time to
time,  independent  suppliers  also conduct  research and  development  activities for
the benefit of the YUM  system.  The Company has announced its intention to move the
Lexington facility to Louisville in 2003.

Environmental Matters

The Company is not aware of any federal,  state or local  environmental  laws or
regulations  that will materially  affect  its earnings or competitive  position,  or
result in material capital  expenditures.  However,  the Company cannot predict  the
effect on its operations of possible  future  environmental  legislation or  regulations.
During 2002,  there were no  material capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.

Government Regulation

U.S.

The Company is subject to various  federal,  state and local laws  affecting
its  business.  Each of the  Company’s  restaurants  must comply with  licensing and
regulation by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which include  health,
sanitation,  safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the
restaurant is located.  In addition,  each  of  the  YUM  operating  companies  must
comply  with  various  state  laws  that  regulate  the  franchisor/franchisee
relationship.  To date,  the Company has not been  significantly  affected by any
difficulty,  delay or failure to obtain  required licenses or approvals.

A small  portion of Pizza  Hut’s net sales is  attributable  to the sale of beer
and wine.  A license is  required in most  cases for each site that sells  alcoholic
beverages  (in most cases,  on an annual  basis) and licenses may be revoked or
suspended  for cause at any time.  Regulations  governing  the sale of  alcoholic
beverages  relate  to many  aspects  of  restaurant  operations,  including the minimum
age of patrons and employees,  hours of operation,  advertising,  wholesale  purchasing,
inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

The Company is also subject to federal and state laws governing  such matters as
employment  and pay practices,  overtime,  tip credits and working  conditions.  The bulk
of the Company’s  employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to  the federal
minimum wage.


The Company is also subject to federal and state child labor laws which,  among other
things,  prohibit the use of certain  “hazardous  equipment” by employees  18
years of age or younger.  The Company has not to date been  materially  adversely
affected by such laws.

The Company  continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the Americans
with  Disabilities Act (“ADA”) in order  to conform to its  requirements.
Under the ADA, the Company  could be required to expend funds to modify its  restaurants
to better provide service to, or make reasonable  accommodation  for the employment of
disabled  persons.  We believe that  expenditures, if required, would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

International.

Internationally,  the Company’s  restaurants are subject to national
and local laws and regulations  which  are similar to those affecting the Company’s U.S.
restaurants,  including laws and regulations  concerning labor, health,  sanitation  and
safety.  The  international  restaurants  are  also  subject  to  tariffs  and
regulations  on  imported  commodities  and  equipment  and  laws  regulating  foreign
investment.  International  compliance  with  environmental  requirements  has not had a
material  adverse  effect on the Company’s  results of  operations,  capital
expenditures  or  competitive position.

Employees

As of year-end 2002, the Company employed  approximately 244,000 persons,
approximately 68 percent of whom were part-time  employees.  Approximately  55 percent of
the  Company’s  employees  are employed in the U.S. The Company  believes that it
provides  working  conditions  and  compensation  that compare  favorably  with those of
its principal  competitors.  Most  Company  employees are paid on an hourly basis.  The
Company’s  non-U.S.  employees are subject to numerous  labor council  relationships
that vary due to the diverse  cultures in which the Company  operates.  The Company
considers its employee  relations to be good.

Properties.

As of year-end  2002,  YUM Concepts  owned over 1,600 units and leased almost 3,600
units in the U.S.;  and YRI owned over  300 units and leased over 2,000 units outside the
U.S.  Company  restaurants in the U.S. which are not owned are generally  leased for
initial  terms of 15 or 20 years and  generally  have renewal  options;  however,  Pizza
Hut  delivery/carryout  units in the U.S.  generally are leased for  significantly
shorter  initial terms with short renewal  options.  Pizza Hut  leases its and YRI’s
corporate  headquarters  and  research  facility in Dallas,  Texas.  Taco Bell leases its
corporate  headquarters  and  research  facility  in  Irvine,  California  and KFC owns
its and YUM’s  corporate  headquarters  and a  research  facility in Louisville,
Kentucky.  LJS and A&W presently lease a corporate  headquarters and research  facility
in  Lexington,  Kentucky;  however,  YUM has announced  its  intention to move the LJS
and A&W headquarters  and research  facility to  Louisville,  Kentucky in 2003.  In
addition,  YUM leases  office  facilities  for certain  support  groups in


Louisville, Kentucky, and Albuquerque,  New Mexico.  Additional information about the Company’s
properties is included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part
II, Item 8, pages 41 through 79.

The Company  believes that its properties are generally in good operating  condition
and are suitable for the purposes for  which they are being used.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company is subject to various claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,
taxes,  real estate,  environmental and  other matters arising in the normal course of
business.  The following is a brief  description of the more  significant of  these
categories  of  lawsuits  and other  matters.  Except as stated  below,  the  Company
believes  that the  ultimate  liability,  if any, in excess of amounts already provided
for these matters in the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  is  not likely to have a
material  adverse effect on the Company’s annual results of operations,  financial
condition or cash  flows.

Franchising

A substantial number of the restaurants of each of the Concepts are franchised to
independent  businesses  operating under  arrangements  with the  Concepts.  In the
course of the  franchise  relationship,  occasional  disputes  arise between the  Company
and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects,  including,  without
limitation,  quality, service, and  cleanliness  issues,  contentions  regarding  grants,
transfers or terminations of franchises,  territorial  disputes and  delinquent payments.

Suppliers

The Company,  through approved distributors,  purchases food, paper, equipment and
other restaurant supplies from numerous  independent  suppliers  throughout  the world.
These  suppliers  are  required to meet and maintain  compliance  with the  Company’s
standards and  specifications.  On occasion,  disputes  arise between the Company and its
suppliers on a number  of issues,  including,  but not limited to,  compliance with
product  specifications  and terms of procurement and service  requirements.

Employees

At any given time,  the Company  employs  hundreds of thousands of persons,  primarily
in its  restaurants.  In addition,  each year thousands of persons seek employment  with
the Company and its  restaurants.  From time to time,  disputes arise  regarding employee
hiring, compensation, termination and promotion practices.

Like some other retail  employers,  the Company has been faced in a few states with
allegations  of purported  class-wide  wage and hour violations.

On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Bravo,
et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Bravo”),  was filed in the  Circuit  Court of the
State of Oregon of the County of  Multnomah.  The  lawsuit was filed by two former  Taco
Bell shift  managers  purporting to represent  approximately  17,000 current and former
hourly  employees  statewide.  The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour
laws,  principally  involving unpaid wages including  overtime,  and  rest and meal
period violations,  and seeks an unspecified amount in damages.  Under Oregon class
action procedures,  Taco  Bell was  allowed an  opportunity  to “cure” the
unpaid  wage and hour  allegations  by opening a claims  process to all  putative  class
members  prior to  certification  of the  class.  In this cure  process,  Taco Bell paid
out less than $1  million.  On January 26, 1999,  the Court  certified a class of all
current and former shift managers and crew members who  claim one or more of the alleged
violations.  A Court-approved  notice and claim form was mailed to approximately  14,500
class  members on January 31, 2000.  Trial began on January 4, 2001.  On March 9, 2001,
the jury reached  verdicts on the  substantive  issues in this matter. A number of these
verdicts were in favor of the Taco Bell position;  however,  certain  issues were
decided in favor of the  plaintiffs.  In April  2002,  a jury trial to  determine  the
damages of 93 of those  claimants  found  that  Taco  Bell  failed to pay for  certain
meal  breaks  and/or  off-the-clock  work for 86 of the 93  claimants.


However,  the total  amount  of hours  awarded  by the jury was  substantially  less  than that  sought
by the  claimants.  In July and September 2002, the court ruled on several post-trial
motions,  including fixing the total number  of potential  claimants at 1,031  (including
the 93 claimants for which damages have already been  determined) and holding  that
claimants who prevail are entitled to prejudgment  interest and penalty wages.  The court
has indicated that it will  likely  schedule a damages trial for the remaining 938
claimants sometime in 2003.  Taco Bell intends to appeal the April  2002 damages verdict
as well as the March 2001 liability verdict.

We have provided for the estimated  costs of the Bravo  litigation,  based on a
projection of eligible  claims  (including  claims filed to date,  where  applicable),
the amount of each eligible  claim,  the estimated  legal fees incurred by the
plaintiffs and the results of settlement  negotiations  in this and other wage and hour
litigation  matters.  Although the  outcome of this case cannot be  determined  at this
time,  we believe the ultimate  cost of this case in excess of amounts  already  provided
will not be  material to our annual  results of  operations,  financial  condition  or
cash flows.  Any  provisions have been recorded as unusual items.

Customers

The  Company’s  restaurants  serve a large and  diverse  cross-section  of the
public and in the course of serving so many  people, disputes arise regarding products,
service,  accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such  as those
of the Company.

Intellectual Property

The Company has  registered  trademarks  and service  marks,  many of which are of
material  importance  to the  Company’s  business.  From time to time,  the  Company
may  become  involved  in  litigation  to defend and  protect  its use of its  registered
marks.

Other Litigation

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit  against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Wrench LLC,
Joseph  Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco  Bell Corp.

(“Wrench”)  was filed in
the United States  District Court for the Western  District of Michigan.  The lawsuit
alleges that Taco Bell Corp.  misappropriated  certain ideas and concepts used in its
advertising  featuring a Chihuahua.  Plaintiffs  seek  to  recover  damages  under
several  theories,  including  breach  of  implied-in-fact  contract,  idea
misappropriation,  conversion and unfair  competition.  On June 10, 1999, the District
Court granted  summary  judgment in  favor of Taco Bell Corp.  Plaintiffs  filed an
appeal with the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (the “Court of  Appeals”),
and oral  arguments  were held on  September  20,  2000.  On July 6, 2001,  the Court of
Appeals  reversed the  District  Court’s  judgment  in  favor  of Taco  Bell and
remanded  the  case to the  District  Court.  Taco  Bell  Corp.  unsuccessfully
petitioned  the Court of Appeals for  rehearing en banc,  and its petition for writ of
certiorari  to the  United States  Supreme  Court was denied on January 21, 2002.  The
case has now  officially  been returned to the District  Court,  where the Wrench
plaintiffs  will be allowed to bring their claims to trial.  It is expected  that the
trial will  commence in May, 2003.

We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and are
vigorously  defending the case.  However,  in view  of the inherent  uncertainties  of
litigation,  the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time.  Likewise,  the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction

On May 16, 2002,  TRICON Global  Restaurants,  Inc. changed its name to YUM!  Brands,
Inc. in order to better reflect our  expanding  portfolio of brands. In addition,  on the
same day, Tricon Restaurants  International  changed its name to YUM!  Restaurants
International.

YUM!  Brands,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  (collectively  referred  to as “YUM” or
the  “Company”)  comprises  the  worldwide  operations of KFC,  Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell,  Long John  Silver’s  (“LJS”) and A&W All-American  Food
Restaurants  (“A&W”) (collectively  “the Concepts”) and is the world’s
largest quick service  restaurant (“QSR”) company based on the number of
system  units.  LJS and A&W were  added when YUM  acquired  Yorkshire  Global
Restaurants,  Inc.  (“YGR”) on May 7, 2002.  Separately,  KFC,  Pizza  Hut and
Taco Bell rank in the top ten among QSR  chains in U.S.  system  sales and  units.  With
11,798  international  units, YUM is the second  largest QSR company outside the
U.S. YUM became an independent,  publicly  owned  company  on  October  6,  1997  (the
“Spin-off  Date”)  via a  tax-free  distribution  of our  Common  Stock  (the
“Distribution” or “Spin-off”) to the shareholders of our former
parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”).

Throughout  Management’s  Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), we make
reference to ongoing operating profit which represents  our operating  profit  excluding
the impact of facility  actions net loss (gain) and unusual items income  (expense).  See
Note 7 to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements for a detailed discussion of these
exclusions.  We use ongoing operating  profit as a key  performance  measure of our
results of  operations  for purposes of  evaluating  performance  internally.  Ongoing
operating  profit is not a measure defined in accounting  principles  generally  accepted
in the United States of  America and should not be  considered  in isolation or as a
substitute  for measures of  performance  in  accordance  with  accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

All  references to per share and share amounts in the following MD&A have been
adjusted to reflect the  two-for-one  stock  split distributed on June 17, 2002.

In 2002, our international  business,  YUM!  Restaurants  International  (“YRI” or
“International”)  accounted for 35% of  system sales,  31% of revenues and 32%
of ongoing  operating  profit  excluding  unallocated  and corporate  expenses.  We
anticipate  that,  despite the  inherent  risks and  typically  higher  general and
administrative  expenses  required by  international  operations,  we  will  continue  to
invest  in  certain  international  markets  with  substantial  growth  potential.

This MD&A should be read in  conjunction  with our  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  on pages 41  through  79 and the  Cautionary  Statements on pages 39 and 40.
All Note  references  herein refer to the Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  on pages 46 through 79.  Tabular  amounts are displayed in millions  except
per share and unit count  amounts,  or as otherwise specifically identified.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our reported  results are impacted by the  application of certain  accounting
policies that require us to make subjective  or complex  judgments.  These  judgments
involve  estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently  uncertain and  may
significantly  impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial
condition.  Changes in the estimates  and  judgements  could  significantly  affect our
results of  operations,  financial  condition  and cash flows in future  years.  A
description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies
follows.


Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our  long-lived  assets for  impairment at the  individual  restaurant
level.  Restaurants  held and used are  evaluated for impairment on a semi-annual  basis
or whenever events or circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of  a restaurant
may not be  recoverable  (including a decision to close a restaurant).  Our  semi-annual
test includes those  restaurants that have experienced two consecutive  years of
operating  losses.  These  impairment  evaluations  require an  estimation  of cash flows
over the  remaining  useful  life of the  primary  asset of the  restaurant,  which can
be for a  period of over 20 years,  and any terminal value. We limit  assumptions  about
important  factors such as sales growth and  margin  improvement  to those that are
supportable  based upon our plans for the unit and  actual  results at  comparable
restaurants.

If the  long-lived  assets  of a  restaurant  on a held  and  used  basis  are  not
recoverable  based  upon  forecasted,  undiscounted  cash flows,  we write the assets
down to their fair value.  This fair value is determined by discounting the  forecasted
cash flows,  including  terminal  value,  of the restaurant at an appropriate  rate. The
discount rate used is  our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is
believed to exist.

When it is probable that we will sell a restaurant we write down the  restaurant to
its fair value.  We often  refranchise  restaurants  in groups  and  therefore  perform
impairment  evaluations  at the group  level.  Fair value is based on the  expected sales
proceeds less  applicable  transaction  costs.  Estimated  sales proceeds are based on
the most relevant of  historical  sales  multiples or bids from buyers,  and have
historically  been  reasonably  accurate  estimations  of the  proceeds ultimately
received.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We record  impairment  charges related to an investment in an  unconsolidated
affiliate  whenever events or circumstances  indicate  that a decrease in the value of an
investment  has occurred  which is other than  temporary.  In  addition,  we  evaluate
our investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates for impairment when they have experienced
two consecutive years of  operating  losses.  Our impairment  measurement test for an
investment in an  unconsolidated  affiliate is similar to that  for our  restaurants
except that we use discounted  cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted
cash flows  before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of
investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Impairment of Goodwill

We evaluate  goodwill for  impairment  on an annual basis through the  comparison of
fair value of our reporting  units to  their  carrying  values.  Our reporting  units are
our operating  segments in the U.S. and our business  management  units  internationally
(typically  individual  countries).  Fair value is the price a willing  buyer would pay
for the reporting  unit, and is generally  estimated by  discounting  expected  future
cash flows from the reporting  units over twenty years  plus an  expected  terminal
value.  We limit  assumptions  about  important  factors  such as  sales  growth  and
margin  improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting
unit.

We impaired $5 million of goodwill  during 2002 related to our Pizza Hut France
reporting  unit. For the remainder of our  reporting  units with  goodwill,  the fair
value is  generally  significantly  in excess of the recorded  carrying  value.  Thus, we
do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given
current business performance.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill.


Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables and Contingent Liabilities

We reserve a franchisee’s  or licensee’s  entire  receivable  balance based
upon  pre-defined  aging criteria and upon the  occurrence  of other events that
indicate  that we may not collect the balance  due. As a result of reserving  using this
methodology,  we have an  immaterial  amount of  receivables  that are past due that have
not been reserved for at December  28, 2002.  See Note 2 for a further discussion of our
policies regarding franchise and license operations.

Primarily as a result of our  refranchising  efforts,  we remain liable for certain
lease  assignments and guarantees.  We  record a liability  for our exposure  under these
lease  assignments  and  guarantees  when such  exposure is probable and  estimable.  At
December  28, 2002,  we have  recorded an  immaterial  liability  for our exposure  which
we consider to be  probable and estimable.  The potential  total exposure under such
leases is  significant,  with $278 million  representing  the present value of the
minimum  payments of the assigned leases at December 28, 2002,  discounted at our pre-tax
cost of  debt.  Current  franchisees  are the  primary  lessees  under  the  vast
majority  of these  leases.  We  generally  have  cross-default  provisions with these
franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise  agreement in the event  of
non-payment under the lease. We believe these cross-default  provisions  significantly
reduce the risk that we will be  required  to make  payments  under these  leases and,
historically,  we have not been  required to make such  payments in  significant amounts.
See Note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees.

Self-Insured Property and Casualty Losses

We record our best  estimate of the  remaining  cost to settle  incurred  self-insured
property and casualty  claims.  The  estimate is based on the results of an independent
actuarial study and considers  historical  claim frequency and severity  as well as
changes  in  factors  such as our  business  environment,  benefit  levels,  medical
costs and the  regulatory  environment that could impact overall  self-insurance  costs.
Additionally,  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that  may occur over the several
years it takes for claims to settle is  included  in our  reserve,  increasing  our
confidence  level that the recorded reserve is adequate.

See Note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.

Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves

At December 28, 2002, we have recorded a valuation  allowance of $137 million
primarily to reduce our net  operating  loss  and tax  credit  carryforwards  of $176
million  to an amount  that  will more  likely  than not be  realized.  These net
operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards exist in many state and foreign
jurisdictions and have varying  carryforward  periods and  restrictions on usage. The
estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign  jurisdictions  and  our
resulting  ability to utilize net  operating  loss and tax credit  carryforwards  can
significantly  change based on  future events,  including our  determinations  as to the
feasibility of certain tax planning  strategies.  Thus,  recorded  valuation allowances
may be subject to material future changes.

As a matter of course,  we are regularly  audited by federal,  state and foreign tax
authorities.  We provide reserves for  potential  exposures  when we consider it probable
that a taxing  authority  may take a  sustainable  position on a matter  contrary to our
position.  We evaluate these reserves,  including  interest  thereon,  on a quarterly
basis to insure that  they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact
our ultimate payment for such exposures.

See Note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes.

Factors Affecting Comparability of 2002 Results to 2001 Results and 2001 Results to
2000 Results

YGR Acquisition

On May 7, 2002,  the  Company  completed  its  acquisition  of YGR,  the parent
company of LJS and A&W. See Note 4 for a  discussion of the acquisition.


As of the date of the  acquisition,  YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and
franchise LJS units,  respectively,  and 127  and 742 company and franchise A&W units,
respectively.  In addition,  133 multibranded  LJS/A&W restaurants were included  in the
LJS unit  totals.  Except as  discussed  in certain  sections  of the MD&A, the impact of
the  acquisition  on our  results of operations in 2002 was not significant.

Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets” (“SFAS
142”), in its entirety.  In accordance with the  requirements of SFAS 142, we ceased
amortization  of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangibles as of December 30, 2001. The
following  table  summarizes the  favorable  effect of SFAS 142 on  restaurant  profit,
restaurant  margin and ongoing  operating  profit had SFAS 142 been  effective in 2001.

Additionally, if SFAS 142 had been effective in 2001, reported net income would have
increased approximately $26 million and  diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”)
would have increased $0.09.

Unusual Items (Income) Expense

We recorded  unusual  items income of $27 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001 and
unusual items expense of $204 million  in 2000.  See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of
our unusual items (income) expense.

Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates

Consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key  international  markets,  we
formed ventures in Canada and Poland  with our  largest  franchisee  in each  market.
The  venture in Canada  was  formed in the third  quarter of 2000 and the  venture in
Poland was  effective in the first quarter of 2001. At the date of  formation,  the
Canadian  venture  operated  over 700  stores and the Poland  venture  operated
approximately  100  stores.  We did not record any gain or loss on the  transfer of
assets to these new ventures.

Previously,  the results from the  restaurants we contributed  to these  ventures were
consolidated.  The impact of these  transactions  on operating  results is similar to the
impact of our  refranchising  activities,  which is described in the  Store Portfolio
Strategy  section below.  Consequently,  these  transactions  resulted in a decline in
our Company sales,  restaurant  margin  dollars and general and  administrative  (“G&A”) expenses
as well as higher  franchise  fees. We also  record equity  income (loss) from
investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  (“equity  income”) and, in Canada,
higher  franchise  fees since the royalty rate was  increased  for those  stores
contributed  by our partner to the venture.  The  formation of these ventures did not
have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001.


Store Portfolio Strategy

Since 1995,  we have been  strategically  reducing  our share of total  system  units
by selling  Company  restaurants  to  existing and new  franchisees  where their
expertise  can  generally be  leveraged  to improve the  restaurants’ overall
operating  performance,  while  retaining  Company  ownership  of  key  U.S.  and
International  markets.  This  portfolio-balancing  activity  reduces our reported
revenues and restaurant  profits,  which  increases the importance of  system sales as a
key performance measure.  We substantially completed our U.S. refranchising program in
2001.

The following table summarizes our refranchising activities:

million to mark to  market the net assets of our Singapore  business,  which was sold
during 2002 at a price  approximately  equal to  its carrying value.

In addition to our  refranchising  program,  we have closed certain  restaurants over
the past several years.  Restaurants  closed include poor performing  restaurants,
restaurants relocated to a new site within the same trade area or U.S. Pizza  Hut
delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine-in traditional store within the
same trade area.

The impact on ongoing  operating  profit  arising from our  refranchising  and store
closure  initiatives  as well as the  contribution  of Company  stores to new
unconsolidated  affiliates is the net of (a) the  estimated  reduction in Company  sales,
restaurant  profit and G&A expenses;  (b) the estimated  increase in franchise fees from
the stores  refranchised;  and (c) the estimated  change in equity  income  (loss).  The
amounts  presented  below reflect the estimated  impact from  stores that were operated
by us for all or some portion of the  respective  previous  year and were no longer
operated by  us as of the last day of the respective year.

Franchisee Financial Condition

Like others in the QSR industry,  from time to time, some of our franchise  operators
experience  financial  difficulties  with respect to their franchise operations.

Depending upon the facts and  circumstances  of each situation,  and in the absence of
an improvement in the  franchisee’s  business trends,  there are a number of
potential  resolutions of these financial issues.  These include a sale of some or  all
of the operator’s  restaurants to us or a third party, a restructuring  of the
operator’s  business  and/or  finances,  or, in the more unusual  cases,  bankruptcy
of the  operator.  It is our practice to  proactively  work with  financially  troubled
franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues.

Since 2000, certain of our franchise  operators,  principally in the Taco Bell system,
have experienced varying degrees of  financial  problems.  Through  December 28, 2002,
restructurings  have been completed for  approximately  1,778 Taco Bell  franchise
restaurants.  In  connection  with  these  restructurings,  Taco  Bell  has  acquired
147  restaurants  for  approximately $76 million.  In addition to these  acquisitions,
Taco Bell has purchased land,  buildings and/or equipment  related to 52


restaurants
from  franchisees  for  approximately  $28 million and  simultaneously  leased it back to
these  franchisees  under  long-term  leases.  As part of the  restructurings,  Taco Bell
committed  to fund  approximately  $45  million of future franchise capital expenditures,
principally through leasing arrangements,  approximately $26 million of  which has been
funded through December 28, 2002. We  substantially  completed the Taco Bell franchisee
restructurings  in  2002 and expect to finalize any remaining restructurings in the first
quarter of 2003.

In the fourth quarter of 2000, Taco Bell also  established a $15 million loan program
to assist certain  franchisees.  All  fundings had been advanced by the end of the first
quarter of 2001. A remaining  net balance of $7 million at December  28, 2002 for
these notes receivable is included primarily in other assets.

We believe that the general  improvement in business trends at Taco Bell has helped
alleviate  financial  problems in the  Taco Bell  franchise  system  which were due to
past  downturns  in sales.  As  described  in the U.S.  revenues  section,  Company
same-store  sales  growth at Taco Bell  increased 7% in 2002.  This follows an 8%
increase in Company  same-store  sales  growth at Taco Bell in the fourth  quarter  of
2001.  Generally,  franchisees  have  experienced  similar or better  growth over these
time frames.  Accordingly,  the cost of  restructurings  of Taco Bell franchise
restaurants was less in  2002 than in 2001 and, though we continue to monitor this
situation, we expect these costs to be less again in 2003.

In 2002 and 2001, the Company charged expenses of $8 million and $18 million,
respectively,  to ongoing  operating profit  related to allowances  for doubtful Taco
Bell franchise and license fee  receivables.  These costs are reported as part of
franchise and license expenses.  On an ongoing basis, we assess our exposure from
franchise-related  risks, which include  estimated  uncollectibility  of franchise and
license  receivables,  contingent lease  liabilities,  guarantees to support  third party
financial  arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees.  The
contingent lease  liabilities  and  guarantees  are more fully  discussed in the Lease
Guarantees  section of Note 24.  Although the ultimate  impact of  these  franchise
financial  issues  cannot be predicted  with  certainty at this time,  we have  provided
for our current  estimate of the  probable  exposure as of December 28,  2002.  It is
reasonably  possible  that there will be  additional  costs;  however,  these costs are
not  expected to be material to  quarterly or annual  results of  operations,  financial
condition or cash flows.

Impact of AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process

See  Note  25 for a  discussion  of the  impact  of the  AmeriServe  Food
Distribution,  Inc.  (“AmeriServe”)  bankruptcy  reorganization process on the
Company.

Impact of the Consolidation of an Unconsolidated Affiliate

At the beginning of 2001, we consolidated a previously  unconsolidated  affiliate in
our Consolidated Financial Statements  as a result of a change in our  intent to
temporarily  retain  control  of this  affiliate.  As a result of this  change,  Company
sales,  restaurant margin and G&A increased  approximately $100 million, $6 million and
$9 million,  respectively,  in 2001.  Also as a result of the change,  franchise  fees
and equity  income  decreased  approximately  $4 million and $2  million,  respectively,
in 2001. At the date of consolidation,  this previously  unconsolidated  affiliate
operated over  100 stores.


Fifty-third Week in 2000

Our fiscal  calendar  results in a fifty-third  week every 5 or 6 years.  Fiscal year
2000 included a fifty-third  week in  the fourth quarter.  The estimated  favorable
impact in net income was $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in 2000. The  following
table  summarizes  the  estimated  favorable/(unfavorable)  impact of the  fifty-third
week on  system  sales,  revenues and ongoing operating profit in 2000:

Worldwide System Sales

System sales  represents  the combined sales of Company,  unconsolidated  affiliates,
franchise and license  restaurants.  Sales of unconsolidated  affiliates and franchise
and license  restaurants result in franchise and license fees for us but  are not
included in the Company  sales figure we present on the  Consolidated  Statements of
Income.  However,  we believe  that system  sales is useful to  investors  as a
significant  indicator  of our  Concepts’ market  share and the overall  strength of
our business as it  incorporates  all of our revenue  drivers,  company and franchise
same store sales as well  as net unit development.

Worldwide General And Administrative Expenses

G&A expenses  increased  $117  million or 15% in 2002.  Excluding  the  unfavorable
impact of the YGR  acquisition,  G&A expenses  increased 10%. The increase was primarily
driven by higher  compensation-related  costs and higher corporate and  project spending.

G&A expenses  decreased  $34 million or 4% in 2001.  Excluding  the favorable  impact
of lapping the  fifty-third  week in  2000,  G&A expenses  decreased  3%. The decrease
was driven by lower  corporate  and project  spending,  the  formation of  unconsolidated
affiliates and refranchising.  The decrease was partially offset by higher
compensation-related costs.


Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses

Franchise and license  expenses  decreased $10 million or 18% in 2002.  The decrease
was primarily  attributable  to lower  allowances for doubtful  franchise and license fee
receivables  and the favorable  impact of lapping support costs related  to the financial
restructuring  of certain Taco Bell  franchisees  in 2001.  The decrease was partially
offset by higher  marketing support costs in certain international markets.

Franchise  and license  expenses  increased  $10 million or 20% in 2001.  The increase

from the adoption of SFAS 142.

Other  (income)  expense  decreased  $2 million  or 8% in 2001.  Equity  income
increased  $1  million or 3%,  after a 6%  unfavorable impact from foreign currency
translation.

Worldwide Facility Actions Net Loss (Gain)

We  recorded  facility  actions net loss of $32  million in 2002 and $1 million in
2001 and  facility  actions net gain of  $176  million  in 2000.  See the Store
Portfolio  Strategy  section  for more  detail of our  refranchising  and  closure
activities  and Note 7 for a summary of the  components  of  facility  actions  net loss

Unallocated  and  corporate  expenses  increased $30 million or 20% in 2002.  The
increase was primarily  driven by higher  compensation-related costs and higher corporate
and project spending.

Unallocated  and corporate  expenses  decreased $15 million or 9% in 2001.  Excluding
the favorable  impact of lapping the  fifty-third  week in 2000,  G&A decreased  8%. The
decline was  primarily  due to lower  corporate  and project  spending  partially offset
by higher compensation-related costs.

increased  $8  million  or 5% in 2002.  Excluding the impact of the YGR  acquisition,
interest  expense  decreased 12%. The decrease was driven by a reduction in  our average
debt  balance  partially  offset by an  increase in our average  interest  rate.  Our
average  interest  rate  increased due to a reduction in our variable-rate  borrowings
using proceeds from the issuance of longer term,  fixed-rate  notes.

Net interest  expense  decreased  $18 million or 10% in 2001.  The decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in our average  interest rate.

The 2002 ongoing  effective tax rate decreased 1.8 percentage  points to 31.3%. The
decrease in the ongoing  effective tax  rate was primarily due to adjustments  related to
prior years and an increase in the benefit from claiming  credit against  our current and
future U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid,  partially offset by reduced
valuation  allowance  reversals. See Note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances.

In 2002,  the effective  tax rate  attributable  to foreign  operations  was lower
than the U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  primarily  due to the benefit of claiming
credit  against our current and future U.S.  income tax  liability  for foreign  taxes
paid.

The 2001 ongoing  effective tax rate decreased 4.6 percentage  points to 33.1%. The
decrease in the ongoing  effective tax  rate was  primarily  due to  adjustments  related
to  prior  years,  partially  offset  by  reduced  valuation  allowance  reversals.


In 2001, the effective tax rate  attributable to foreign  operations was slightly
higher than the U.S.  federal  statutory  rate because losses of foreign  operations for
which no benefit could be currently  recognized and other  adjustments more  than offset
the effect of claiming credit against our U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes
paid.

the  favorable  impact  of  the  YGR  acquisition,  system sales  increased  4%. The
increase  resulted  from same store sales growth and new unit  development,  partially
offset by store closures.


System sales  increased $82 million or 1% in 2001.  Excluding the unfavorable  impact
of lapping the  fifty-third  week in  2000,  system sales  increased 2%. The increase was
driven by new unit  development and same store sales growth at KFC and  Pizza Hut,
partially offset by store closures.

U.S. Revenues

Company  sales  increased  $491 million or 11% in 2002.  Excluding the favorable
impact of the YGR  acquisition,  company  sales  increased  3%. The  increase  was driven
by new unit  development  and same store sales  growth.  The  increase was  partially
offset by store closures and refranchising.

For 2002,  blended  Company  same  store  sales for KFC,  Pizza  Hut and Taco  Bell
were up 2% due to  increases  in both  transactions  and average guest check.  Same store
sales at Taco Bell increased 7%,  primarily  driven by a 4% increase in  transactions.
Same store  sales at both Pizza Hut and KFC were flat due to a 2% increase  in average
guest check  offset  by transaction declines.

Company sales decreased $246 million or 5% in 2001.  Excluding the unfavorable  impact
of lapping the fifty-third  week in  2000, Company sales decreased 4%.  The decrease was
driven by refranchising, partially offset by new unit development.

For 2001,  blended  Company same store sales for KFC,  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were up
1% on a comparable  fifty-two  week  basis.  An increase in the average  guest check was
partially  offset by  transaction  declines.  Same store sales at KFC  were up 3%,
primarily  due to an  increase in  transactions.  Same store sales at both Pizza Hut and
Taco Bell were flat.  A 2%  increase in the  average  guest  check at Pizza Hut and a 3%

Restaurant  margin as a percentage of sales  increased  approximately  80 basis points

points from the  adoption of SFAS 142,  which was  partially  offset by the  unfavorable
impact of approximately  20 basis points from the YGR  acquisition.  The increase was
primarily driven by the  favorable  impact of same store sales growth on margin and lower
food and paper costs,  partially offset by an increase in  labor  costs.  The  decrease
in food and paper costs was  primarily  driven by cheese  costs.  The increase in labor
costs  was primarily driven by wage rates.

Restaurant  margin as a percentage of sales was flat in 2001.  The  favorable  impact
of same store sales growth on margin  was offset by  increases  in occupancy  and other

primarily driven by cheese costs.  The increase in labor costs was primarily driven by
wage rates.

U.S. Ongoing Operating Profit

Ongoing  operating  profit  increased  $103 million or 14% in 2002,  including a 3%
favorable  impact from the adoption of  SFAS 142.  Excluding the favorable  impact of
both SFAS 142 and the YGR  acquisition,  ongoing  operating profit increased  8%. The
increase  was driven by same store sales  growth and the  favorable  impact of lapping
franchise  support  costs  related to the  restructuring  of certain Taco Bell
franchisees  in 2001.  The increase  was  partially  offset by higher  restaurant
operating costs,  primarily due to higher labor costs, and the unfavorable  impact of
refranchising  and store  closures.  The higher labor costs were driven by wage rates.

Ongoing  operating  profit  decreased  $20  million  or 3% in 2001.  Excluding  the
unfavorable  impact  of  lapping  the  fifty-third week in 2000,  ongoing  operating
profit  decreased 1%. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable  impact of
refranchising  and store closures,  higher  restaurant  operating costs and higher
franchise  support costs related to the  restructuring  of certain Taco Bell
franchisees.  The decrease  was  partially  offset by same store sales growth and new

partially  offset by  refranchising  and store  closures.  The  unfavorable  impact of
refranchising primarily resulted from the sale of the Singapore business in the third
quarter of 2002.

Company sales  increased  $79 million or 5% in 2001,  after a 5%  unfavorable  impact

Restaurant  margin as a percentage  of sales  increased  approximately  210 basis
points in 2002,  including the favorable  impact of  approximately  60 basis  points
from the  adoption  of SFAS 142.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven by the  favorable
impact of lower  restaurant  operating  costs and the  elimination  of lower average
margin units through store  closures.  Lower  restaurant  operating  costs  primarily
resulted from lower food and paper costs,  partially  offset by  higher labor costs.

Restaurant  margin as a percentage of sales decreased  approximately  120 basis points
in 2001. The decrease was primarily  attributable to higher  restaurant  operating  costs
and the acquisition of below average margin stores from  franchisees.  The decrease was
partially offset by the favorable impact of same store sales growth.


International Ongoing Operating Profit

Ongoing  operating  profit  increased  $71  million or 22% in 2002, after a 1%
unfavorable  impact from  foreign  currency  translation.  Excluding the impact of
foreign  currency  translation  and the  favorable  impact from the adoption of SFAS
142,  ongoing  operating  profit  increased 17%. The increase was driven by new unit
development and the favorable impact  of lower  restaurant  operating  costs,  primarily
lower cost of food and paper.  The  increase was  partially  offset by  higher G&A expenses,
primarily compensation-related costs.

Ongoing  operating  profit  increased  $9 million or 3% in 2001,  after a 7%
unfavorable  impact  from  foreign  currency  translation.  Excluding the unfavorable
impact of foreign currency  translation and lapping the fifty-third week in 2000,
ongoing  operating  profit  increased  12%. The increase was driven by new unit
development  and same store sales growth,  partially offset by higher restaurant

Consolidated Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating  activities

was $1,088 million  compared to $832
million in 2001.  Excluding the impact of  the AmeriServe  bankruptcy  reorganization
process,  cash provided by operating activities was $1,043 million versus $704  million
in 2001.  This  increase  was  primarily  driven by higher  operating  profit  and
timing  of tax  receipts  and  payments.

In 2001,  net cash  provided by operating  activities  was $832 million  compared to
$491 million in 2000.  Excluding  the  impact of the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy
reorganization  process,  cash  provided by operating  activities  was $704 million
versus $734 million in 2000.

Net cash used in  investing  activities

was $885  million  versus  $503  million in
2001.  The  increase in cash used was  primarily due to the  acquisition  of YGR and
higher  capital  spending in 2002,  partially  offset by the  acquisition of  fewer
restaurants from franchisees in 2002.

In 2001,  net cash used in investing  activities  was $503 million  versus $237
million in 2000. The increase in cash used  was primarily due to lower gross
refranchising  proceeds as a result of selling fewer  restaurants in 2001 and increased
acquisitions  of restaurants  from  franchisees  and capital  spending.  The increase was
partially  offset by lapping the  funding of a debtor-in-possession revolving credit
facility to AmeriServe in 2000.

Although we report gross proceeds in our Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows, we
also consider  refranchising  proceeds  on an “after-tax” basis.  We define
after-tax  proceeds as gross  refranchising  proceeds less the settlement of working
capital  liabilities  (primarily  accounts  payable and property taxes) related to the
units  refranchised  and payment of  taxes on the gains.  The after-tax  proceeds can be
used to pay down debt or repurchase  shares.  After-tax  proceeds were  approximately
$71 million in 2002 which  reflects a 21% decrease from 2001.  This  decrease was due to
the  refranchising  of fewer restaurants in 2002 versus 2001.

Net cash used in financing  activities

was $187 million  versus $352  million in
2001.  The decrease is primarily  due to  lower debt  repayments and higher  proceeds
from stock option  exercises  versus 2001,  partially  offset by higher shares
repurchased in 2002.

In 2001,  net cash used in financing  activities  was $352 million  compared to $207
million in 2000. The increase in cash  used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt,
partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000.

In November  2002,  our Board of Directors  authorized a new share  repurchase
program.  This  program  authorizes  us to  repurchase,  through  November  20,  2004,
up to $300  million of our  outstanding  Common  Stock  (excluding  applicable
transaction  fees).  During 2002, we repurchased  approximately  1.2 million shares for
approximately  $28 million under  this program.


In  February  2001,  our  Board of  Directors  authorized  a share  repurchase
program.  This  program  authorized  us to  repurchase  up to $300 million of our
outstanding  Common  Stock  (excluding  applicable  transaction  fees).  This share
repurchase  program  was  completed  in  2002.  During  2002,  we  repurchased
approximately  7.0  million  shares  for  approximately  $200  million  under this
program.  During  2001,  we  repurchased  approximately  4.8 million  shares for
approximately $100 million.

In  September  1999,  our Board of  Directors  authorized  a share  repurchase
program.  This  program  authorized  us to  repurchase  up to $350 million of our
outstanding  Common  Stock  (excluding  applicable  transaction  fees).  This share
repurchase  program  was  completed  in  2000.  During  2000,  we  repurchased
approximately  12.8  million  shares  for  approximately $216 million.

See Note 21 for a discussion of the share repurchase programs.

Financing Activities

On June 25,  2002,  we  closed  on a new $1.4  billion  senior  unsecured  Revolving
Credit  Facility  (the  “New  Credit  Facility”).  The New Credit  Facility
replaced  the  existing  bank  credit  agreement  which was  comprised  of a senior
unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility  (collectively  referred to as  the “Old Credit  Facilities”)  that
were  scheduled to mature on October 2, 2002.  On December 27,  2002,  we  voluntarily
reduced our maximum  borrowings  under the New Credit Facility from $1.4 billion to $1.2
billion.  The New Credit Facility  matures on June 25, 2005. We used the initial
borrowings  under the New Credit Facility to repay the  indebtedness  under  the Old
Credit Facilities.

The New Credit Facility is  unconditionally  guaranteed by our principal  domestic
subsidiaries  and contains other terms  and provisions (including representations,
warranties,  covenants, conditions and events of default) similar to those set  forth in
the Old Credit  Facilities.  Specifically,  the New Credit  Facility  contains  financial
covenants  relating to  maintenance  of leverage  and fixed  charge  coverage  ratios.
The New Credit  Facility  also  contains  affirmative  and  negative  covenants
including,  among  other  things,  limitations  on certain  additional  indebtedness,
guarantees  of  indebtedness, cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain
other transactions as defined in the agreement.

Under the terms of the New Credit Facility,  we may borrow up to the maximum
borrowing limit less outstanding  letters of  credit.  At December 28, 2002, our unused
New Credit Facility totaled $0.9 billion,  net of outstanding  letters of credit  of $0.2
billion.  The interest  rate for  borrowings  under the New Credit  Facility  ranges from
1.00% to 2.00% over the  London  Interbank  Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or 0.00% to
0.65% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime  Rate or the
Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate  plus 1%.  The  exact  spread  over  LIBOR or the
Alternate  Base  Rate,  as  applicable,  will depend upon our performance under specified
financial criteria.  Interest is payable at least quarterly.  In the third quarter of
2002, we capitalized  debt issuance costs of  approximately  $9 million  related to the
New Credit  Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized into interest expense
over the life of the New Credit Facility.

In June 2002,  we issued  $400  million of 7.70%  Senior  Unsecured  Notes due July 1,
2012 (the  “2012  Notes”).  The net  proceeds from the issuance of the 2012
Notes were used to repay  indebtedness  under the New Credit Facility.  Interest on  the
2012 Notes is  payable  January 1 and July 1 of each year and  commenced  on January  1,
2003.  We  capitalized  debt  issuance  costs of  approximately  $5  million  related to
the 2012 Notes in third  quarter  of 2002.  Subsequent  to this  issuance, we have $150
million available for issuance under a $2 billion shelf registration filed in 1997.

As discussed in Note 4, upon the  acquisition  of YGR, we assumed  approximately  $168
million in present  value of future  rent  obligations  related to certain
sale-leaseback  agreements  entered  into by YGR  involving  approximately  350 LJS
units. As a result of liens held by the  buyer/lessor on certain personal  property
within the units,  the  sale-leaseback  agreements  have been accounted for as financings
and are reflected as debt in our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements as  of December 28,
2002.  Rental  payments made under these  agreements  will be made on a monthly basis
through 2019 with an  effective interest rate of approximately 11%.


Consolidated Financial Condition

Assets

increased $975 million or 22% to $5.4 billion.  This increase was primarily
due to the  acquisition of YGR and the  impact of capital  spending.  The  decrease in
the  allowance  for doubtful  accounts  from $77 million to $42 million was  primarily
the result of  recoveries  related to the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy  reorganization
process (see Note 25) and the  write-off of receivables  previously fully reserved.  The
increase in assets  classified as held for sale is due primarily  to classification of
our Puerto Rico market as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2002.

Liabilities

increased  $485 million or 11% to $4.8  billion.  The  increase was
primarily  due to  additional  financing  associated  with the  acquisition  of YGR. As
discussed in Note 14, the decrease in short-term  borrowings of $550 million  and the
increase  in  long-term  debt of $747  million  are  primarily  the result of the
replacement  of our Old Credit  Facilities  that were to expire in October  2002 with the
New Credit  Facility  that will expire in 2005.  The increase in  current income taxes
payable was primarily the result of a  reclassification  from other  liabilities and
deferred credits  for taxes that are now expected to be paid within the next twelve
months.

Liquidity

Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate  substantial  cash flows from the
operations of our company stores and  from our franchise  operations,  which require a
limited YUM  investment in operating  assets.  Typically,  our cash flows  include a
significant  amount of discretionary  capital spending.  Though a decline in revenues
could adversely impact our  cash flows from operations,  we believe our operating cash
flows and ability to adjust discretionary  capital spending and  borrow funds will allow
us to meet our cash requirements in 2003 and beyond.

$1  billion as of  year-end  2002 and total  revenues  of  approximately  $1.8  billion
in 2002.

See Note 2.

Pension Plan Funded Status

Certain of our employees are covered under  noncontributory  defined benefit pension
plans.  The most significant of these  plans was amended in 2001 such that employees
hired after  September 30, 2001 are no longer  eligible to  participate.  As  of our
September 30, 2002 measurement date, these plans had a projected  benefit  obligation  (“PBO”)
of $501 million,  an  accumulated  benefit  obligation  (“ABO”) of $448 million
and a fair value of plan assets of $251  million.  Subsequent to  the  measurement  date
but prior to December 28, 2002, we made an additional $25 million  contribution  to the
plans which  is not  included  in this fair  value of plan  assets.  As a result of the
$250  million  underfunded  status of the plans  relative to the PBO at September 30,
2002, we have recorded a $71 million  charge to  shareholders’ equity (net of tax of
$43 million) as of December 28, 2002.

The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates
assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels.  Due to the
relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly
sensitive to changes in discount rates.  We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 6.85% at September 30,
2002.  A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our PBO by approximately $49 million at
September 30, 2002.  Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our PBO by
approximately $56 million at September 30, 2002.


Due to recent stock market declines,  our pension plan assets have  experienced
losses in value in 2002 and 2001 totaling  approximately  $75  million.  We changed  our
expected  long-term  rate of return on plan assets from 10% to 8.5% for the
determination  of our 2002 expense.  We believe that this  assumption is  appropriate
given the  composition  of our plan  assets and historical  market returns  thereon.
This change  resulted in the recognition of  approximately  $5 million in  incremental
expense in  comparison  to 2001.  We will  continue  to use the 8.5%  expected  rate of
return on plan assets  assumption for the  determination  of pension  expense in 2003.
Given no change to the  market-related  value of our plan assets as of  September 30, 2002, a one
percentage  point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets
assumption  would decrease or increase, respectively, our pension plan expense by
approximately $3 million.

The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to the
unrecognized actuarial loss of $169 million in our plans as of September 30, 2002. For purposes of determining 2002
expense our funded status was such that we recognized $1 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2002.  We will
recognize approximately $7 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2003.  Given no change to the assumptions at our
September 30, 2002 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will increase gradually over the next few years,
however, we do not believe the increase will materially impact our results of operations.

In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $14 million to $41 million in 2003. We have incorporated
this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook.  The increase is driven by an increase in interest cost
because of the higher PBO and the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph.  Service cost
will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate, though as previously mentioned the plans are closed to new
participants.  A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 6.85% at September 30, 2002 would impact our
pension expense by approximately $11 million.

We do not believe that the underfunded  status of the pension plans will materially
affect our financial  position or cash  flows in 2003 or future years.  Given current
funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate  making  contributions  to fully
fund the pension  plans over the course of the next five  years.  We believe  that our
cash flows from  operating  activities of approximately  $1 billion per year are
sufficient to allow us to make necessary  contributions to the plans,  and  anticipated
fundings have been  incorporated  into our cash flow  projections.  We have included
known and expected  increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan
contributions in our operating plans and outlook.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial  market risks  associated with interest  rates,
foreign  currency  exchange rates and  commodity  prices.  In the normal course of
business and in accordance with our policies,  we manage these risks through a  variety
of  strategies,  which may  include  the use of  derivative  financial  and  commodity
instruments  to hedge our  underlying  exposures.  Our  policies  prohibit  the use of
derivative  instruments  for  trading  purposes,  and we have  procedures in place to
monitor and control their use.

Interest Rate Risk

We have a significant  market risk exposure to changes in interest  rates,
principally in the United  States.  We attempt  to minimize this risk and lower our
overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative  financial  instruments,
primarily  interest  rate  swaps.  These  swaps are  entered  into with  financial
institutions  and have reset dates and  critical  terms  that  match  those of the
underlying  debt.  Accordingly,  any change in market  value  associated  with  interest
rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt.


At December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, a  hypothetical  100 basis point  increase
in short-term  interest rates would  result in a  reduction  of $6  million  and $4
million,  respectively,  in annual  income  before  taxes.  The  estimated  reductions
are based  upon the  unhedged  portion  of our  variable  rate debt and  assume no
changes  in the  volume or  composition  of debt.  In  addition,  the fair value of our
derivative  financial  instruments  at December  28, 2002 and  December  29, 2001 would
decrease  approximately  $8 million and $5 million,  respectively.  The fair value of our
Senior  Unsecured  Notes at December  28, 2002 and  December 29, 2001 would  decrease
approximately  $93 million and $72 million,  respectively. Fair value was determined by
discounting the projected cash flows.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

International  ongoing operating profit constitutes  approximately 32% of our ongoing
operating profit in 2002,  excluding  unallocated and corporate  expenses.  In addition,
the Company’s net asset exposure  (defined as foreign  currency assets  less foreign
currency  liabilities)  totaled  approximately $1 billion as of December 28, 2002.
Operating in international  markets  exposes the Company to movements in foreign
currency  exchange rates.  The Company’s  primary  exposures  result  from our
operations in  Asia-Pacific,  the Americas and Europe.  Changes in foreign  currency
exchange rates would impact  the translation of our investments in foreign  operations,
the fair value of our foreign currency  denominated  financial  instruments and our
reported  foreign  currency  denominated  earnings and cash flows.  For the fiscal year
ended December  28,  2002,  operating  profit  would have  decreased  $43 million if all
foreign  currencies  had  uniformly  weakened 10%  relative to the U.S.  dollar.  The
estimated  reduction  assumes no changes in sales volumes or local  currency  sales or
input prices.

We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign  operations
by financing those  investments with  local  currency  debt when  practical.  In
addition,  we attempt to minimize  the  exposure  related to foreign  currency
denominated  financial  instruments  by  purchasing  goods and  services  from  third
parties  in local  currencies  when  practical.  Consequently,  foreign  currency
denominated  financial  instruments  consist  primarily  of  intercompany  short-term
receivables  and payables.  At times,  we utilize  forward  contracts to reduce our
exposure  related to these  foreign  currency  denominated  financial  instruments.  The
notional  amount and maturity dates of these  contracts match  those  of the  underlying
receivables  or  payables  such  that our  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  related  to
these  instruments is eliminated.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk  associated
with commodity  prices.  Our ability to  recover  increased  costs  through  higher
pricing  is, at times,  limited  by the  competitive  environment  in which we  operate.
We manage our  exposure  to this risk  primarily  through  pricing  agreements  as well
as, on a limited  basis,  commodity  future and option  contracts.  Commodity  future and
option  contracts  entered into for the fiscal years ended  December 28, 2002, and
December 29, 2001, did not significantly  impact our financial  position,  results of
operations or  cash flows.

Cautionary Statements

From time to time,  in both  written  reports and oral  statements,  we present  “forward-looking
statements” within the  meaning of Section 27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
amended,  and Section 21E of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934,  as amended.  The
statements  include  those  identified by such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan” and
other similar  terminology.  These  “forward-looking  statements” reflect our
current  expectations  regarding  future  events and operating and  financial
performance  and are based upon data  available at the time of the  statements.  Actual
results  involve  risks and  uncertainties,  including  both those  specific to the
Company and those  specific to the industry, and could differ materially from
expectations.


Company risks and uncertainties  include,  but are not limited to,  potentially
substantial tax contingencies  related to  the  Spin-off,  which,  if they occur,
require us to indemnify  PepsiCo,  Inc.;  our  substantial  debt  leverage and the
attendant  potential  restriction on our ability to borrow in the future, as well as our
substantial  interest expense and  principal repayment  obligations;  potential
unfavorable  variances between estimated and actual liabilities;  our ability  to secure
distribution  of products and  equipment to our  restaurants  on  favorable  economic
terms and our ability to  ensure  adequate  supply of  restaurant  products and
equipment  in our stores;  the ongoing  financial  viability of our  franchisees  and
licensees;  volatility  of  actuarially  determined  losses and loss  estimates;  and
adoption of new or  changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements
promulgated by standard setting bodies.

Industry  risks and  uncertainties  include,  but are not limited to,  global and
local  business,  economic and political  conditions;  legislation and governmental
regulation;  competition;  success of operating initiatives and advertising and
promotional  efforts;  volatility of commodity costs;  increases in minimum wage and
other operating  costs;  availability  and cost of land and construction;  consumer
preferences,  spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic
instability  in local markets and changes in currency  exchange and interest  rates;  any
adverse  economic or operational  repercussions from terrorist activities and any
governmental response thereto; and war or risk of war.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share data)

Note 1 – Description of Business

On May 16, 2002,  Tricon Global  Restaurants,  Inc. changed its name to YUM!  Brands,
Inc. in order to better reflect our  expanding  portfolio of brands. In addition,  on the
same day, Tricon Restaurants  International  changed its name to YUM!  Restaurants
International.

YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries  (collectively  referred to as “YUM” or
the “Company”)  comprises the worldwide  operations  of KFC,  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell
and since May 7, 2002,  Long John Silver’s  (“LJS”) and A&W All-American
Food  Restaurants  (“A&W”) (collectively the “Concepts”),  which were
added when we acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants,  Inc. (“YGR”). YUM  is the
world’s largest quick service  restaurant  company based on the number of system
units, with nearly 33,000 units in  more than 100 countries and  territories  of which
approximately  36% are located  outside the U.S. YUM was created as an  independent,
publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the “Spin-off  Date”) via a tax-free
distribution  by our former  parent,  PepsiCo,  Inc.  (“PepsiCo”),  of our
Common  Stock  (the  “Distribution” or  “Spin-off”)  to its
shareholders.  References to YUM throughout these  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
are made using the first person notations of “we,” “us ” or “our.”

Through our  widely-recognized  Concepts,  we develop,  operate,  franchise and
license a system of both  traditional  and  non-traditional  quick service  restaurants.
Each Concept has  proprietary  menu items and emphasizes the  preparation of  food with
high quality  ingredients  as well as unique  recipes and special  seasonings  to provide
appealing,  tasty and  attractive food at competitive  prices.  Our traditional
restaurants  feature  dine-in,  carryout and, in some instances,  drive-thru or delivery
service.  Non-traditional  units,  which are principally  licensed  outlets,  include
express units  and kiosks  which have a more  limited menu and operate in
non-traditional  locations  like  airports,  gasoline  service  stations,  convenience
stores, stadiums,  amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet
would not be  practical or  efficient.  We are actively  pursuing the strategy of
multibranding,  where two or more of our Concepts are  operated in a single  unit.  In
addition,  we are testing  multibranding  options  involving  one of our  Concepts  and a
restaurant concept not owned or affiliated with YUM.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our preparation of the accompanying  Consolidated  Financial Statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America  requires
us to make estimates and assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of  assets and
liabilities,  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements,  and the  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from the estimates.

Principles of  Consolidation  and Basis of  Preparation.

Intercompany  accounts and
transactions  have been  eliminated.  Certain  investments  in  businesses  that operate
our Concepts are  accounted  for by the equity  method.  Generally,  we  possess 50%
ownership of and 50% voting rights over these  affiliates.  Our lack of majority  voting
rights  precludes us  from controlling  these affiliates,  and thus we do not consolidate
these affiliates.  Our share of the net income or loss  of those unconsolidated
affiliates is included in other (income) expense.

We participate in various  advertising  cooperatives with our franchisees and
licensees.  In certain of these cooperatives  we  possess  majority  voting  rights,  and
thus  control  the  cooperatives.  We have  previously  netted  assets  of the
cooperatives  we control  with the  related  advertising  payables.  We have shown the
assets  and  liabilities  of these  cooperatives on a gross basis in the  Consolidated
Balance Sheet for December 28, 2002, and  reclassified  amounts in the  Consolidated
Balance  Sheet for December 29, 2001  accordingly.  As the  contributions  are
designated  for  advertising  expenditures,  any cash held by these cooperatives is
considered  restricted and is included in prepaid expenses and other  current  assets.
Such  restricted  cash was  approximately  $44 million and $18 million at December 28,
2002 and December  29,  2001,  respectively.  Additionally,  these  cooperatives  had
receivables  from  franchisees  of $13 million and $15  million and other


current
assets of $3 million and $4 million at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,
respectively,  which have been included in our Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  As the
contributions to these  cooperatives are designated  and  segregated  for  advertising,
we  act  as  an  agent  for  the  franchisees  and  licensees  with  regard  to  these
contributions.  Thus, in accordance  with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (“SFAS”)
No. 45,  “Accounting for  Franchise  Fee  Revenue,” we do  not  reflect
franchisee  and  licensee  contributions  to  these  cooperatives  in  our  Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Fiscal Year.

Our fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in December and, as a result,
a fifty-third  week is added every  five or six years.  Fiscal year 2000  included 53
weeks.  The Company’s  next fiscal year with 53 weeks will be 2005.  The  first
three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and the fourth  quarter  consists
of 17 weeks in fiscal years  with 53 weeks and 16 weeks in fiscal  years with 52 weeks.
Our  subsidiaries  operate on similar  fiscal  calendars  with  period end dates suited
to their businesses.  The  subsidiaries’ period end dates are within one week of YUM’s
period end  date with the  exception  of our  international  businesses,  which  close
one period or one month  earlier to  facilitate  consolidated reporting.

Reclassifications.

We have reclassified  certain items in the accompanying
Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes  thereto for prior  periods to be
comparable  with the  classification  we adopted for the fiscal year ended  December 28,
2002.  These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.

Franchise and License  Operations.

We execute  franchise or license  agreements for
each unit which sets out the terms of  our arrangement with the franchisee or licensee.
Our franchise and license  agreements  typically  require the franchisee  or licensee to
pay an initial,  non-refundable  fee and continuing  fees based upon a percentage of
sales.  Subject to our  approval and payment of a renewal fee, a franchisee may generally
renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration.

We recognize  initial fees as revenue when we have performed  substantially all
initial services required by the franchise  or license  agreement,  which is generally
upon the opening of a store.  We recognize  continuing  fees as earned with an
appropriate  provision for  estimated  uncollectible  amounts,  which is included in
franchise  and license  expenses.  We  recognize renewal fees in income when a renewal
agreement  becomes  effective.  We include initial fees collected upon the  sale of a
restaurant to a franchisee in  refranchising  gains (losses).  Fees for  development
rights are capitalized and  amortized over the life of the development agreement.

We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities and their
representative  organizations and our  company  operated  restaurants.  These  expenses,
along with other costs of sales and  servicing of franchise and license  agreements  are
charged to general and  administrative  expenses as incurred.  Certain  direct costs of
our  franchise and  license  operations  are charged to  franchise  and  license
expenses.  These  costs  include  provisions  for  estimated  uncollectible  fees,
franchise and license  marketing  funding,  amortization  expense for franchise  related
intangible  assets and certain other direct  incremental  franchise and license  support
costs.  Franchise and license  expenses also  includes rental income from subleasing
restaurants to franchisees net of the related occupancy costs.

We monitor the  financial  condition of our  franchisees  and  licensees and record
provisions  for  estimated  losses on  receivables  when we believe that our  franchisees
or licensees are unable to make their required  payments.  While we use  the best
information  available  in making our  determination,  the  ultimate  recovery of
recorded  receivables  is also  dependent  upon future  economic  events and other
conditions  that may be beyond our control.  Included in franchise and  license expenses
are provisions for uncollectible  franchise and license  receivables of $15 million,  $24
million and $30  million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.


Direct  Marketing  Costs.

We report  substantially  all of our direct  marketing
costs in occupancy and other  operating  expenses.  We charge direct  marketing  costs to
expense  ratably in relation to revenues over the year in which  incurred  and, in the
case of advertising  production  costs, in the year first shown.  Deferred direct
marketing  costs,  which are  classified as prepaid  expenses,  consist of media and
related  advertising  production costs which will generally be used  for the first time
in the next fiscal year.  To the extent we  participate  in  advertising  cooperatives,
we expense our  contributions  as incurred.  At the end of 2002 and 2001,  we had
deferred  marketing  costs of $8 million and $2 million,  respectively.  Our  advertising
expenses  were $384  million,  $328  million  and $325  million  in 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses,  which we
expense as incurred,  were $23 million in  2002, $23 million in 2001 and $24 million in
2000.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

Effective  December 30, 2001, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 144,  “Accounting  for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets” (“SFAS 144”).  SFAS 144 retained many of the
fundamental  provisions  of SFAS No. 121,  “Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” (“SFAS  121”),
but resolved certain  implementation  issues associated with that Statement.  The
adoption of SFAS 144 did not have  a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations.

In  accordance  with SFAS 144,  we review our  long-lived  assets  related to each
restaurant  to be held and used in the  business,  including any allocated  intangible
assets subject to amortization,  semi-annually for impairment,  or whenever  events or
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  amount of a  restaurant  may
not be  recoverable.  We  evaluate  restaurants using a “two-year  history of
operating  losses” as our primary  indicator of potential  impairment.  Based on the
best information  available,  we write down an impaired  restaurant to its estimated fair
market value, which  becomes its new cost basis.  We  generally  measure  estimated  fair
market  value by  discounting  estimated  future cash  flows.  In  addition,  when we
decide to close a  restaurant  it is reviewed  for  impairment  and  depreciable  lives
are  adjusted.  The  impairment  evaluation  is based on the  estimated  cash flows from
continuing  use through the  expected  disposal date and the expected terminal value.

Store closure costs include costs of disposing of the assets as well as other
facility-related  expenses from  previously  closed  stores.  These store closure costs
are expensed as incurred.  Additionally,  at the date the closure is considered
probable,  we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining operating
lease obligations  subsequent to the  expected closure date, net of estimated sublease
income, if any.

Refranchising  gains  (losses)  includes  the  gains or  losses  from the  sales of
our  restaurants  to new and  existing  franchisees  and the related initial  franchise
fees,  reduced by transaction  costs and direct  administrative  costs of  refranchising.
In  executing  our  refranchising  initiatives,  we most often offer  groups of
restaurants.  We classify  restaurants as held for sale and suspend  depreciation  and
amortization  when (a) we make a decision to refranchise;  (b)  the stores  can be
immediately  removed  from  operations;  (c) we have  begun an active  program to locate
a buyer;  (d)  significant  changes  to the plan of sale are not  likely;  and (e) the
sale is  probable  within one year.  We  recognize  losses  on  refranchisings  when the
restaurants  are  classified  as held for sale.  We  recognize  gains on  restaurant
refranchisings  when the sale  transaction  closes,  the  franchisee has a minimum amount
of the purchase price in at-risk  equity,  and we are  satisfied  that  the  franchisee
can  meet  its  financial  obligations.  If the  criteria  for gain  recognition  are not
met, we defer the gain to the extent we have a remaining  financial  exposure in
connection  with the  sales  transaction.  Deferred  gains  are  recognized  when  the
gain  recognition  criteria  are met or as our  financial  exposure  is  reduced.  When
we make a decision to retain a store  previously  held for sale,  we revalue the store at
the  lower of its (a) net book value at our original sale decision date less normal
depreciation and  amortization  that would  have been recorded  during the period held
for sale or (b) its current fair market  value.  This value becomes the store’s  new
cost basis.  We charge (or  credit) any  difference  between  the  store’s  carrying
amount and its new cost basis to  refranchising  gains  (losses).  When we make a
decision  to close a store  previously  held for  sale,  we  reverse  any  previously
recognized  refranchising  loss and then  record  impairment  and  store  closure  costs
as  described  above.  Refranchising  gains  (losses)  also include  charges for
estimated  exposures  related to


those  partial  guarantees  of  franchisee loan pools
and contingent lease  liabilities  which arose from  refranchising  activities.  These
exposures are  more fully discussed in Note 24.

SFAS 144 also  requires the results of  operations  of a component  entity that is
classified as held for sale or has been  disposed of be reported as  discontinued
operations in the  Consolidated  Statements of Income if certain  conditions are  met.
These  conditions  include  elimination  of the  operations  and cash flows of the
component  entity from the ongoing  operations of the Company and no  significant
continuing  involvement  by the Company in the  operations of the component  entity after
the disposal  transaction.  The results of  operations  of stores  meeting  both these
conditions  that were  disposed of in 2002 or  classified  as held for sale at December
28,  2002 were not  material  for any of the three years  ended December 28, 2002.

Considerable  management  judgment is necessary to estimate  future cash flows,
including cash flows from continuing use,  terminal value,  closure costs,  sublease
income,  and  refranchising  proceeds.  Accordingly,  actual results could vary
significantly from our estimates.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated  Affiliates.

Our methodology for
determining and measuring  impairment of our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates
is similar to the  methodology we use for our  restaurants  except we use cash  flows
after  interest and taxes instead of cash flows before  interest and taxes as we use for
our  restaurants.  Also, we  record impairment  charges related to investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates if circumstances  indicate that a decrease  in the value of an
investment has occurred which is other than temporary.

Considerable  management  judgment is necessary to estimate  future cash flows.
Accordingly,  actual  results  could vary  significantly from our estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash equivalents  represent funds we have temporarily
invested (with original  maturities not  exceeding three months) as part of managing our
day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.

Inventories.

We  value  our  inventories  at the  lower of cost  (computed  on the
first-in,  first-out  method)  or net  realizable value.

Property,  Plant  and  Equipment.

We state  property,  plant and  equipment  at cost
less  accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization,  impairment  writedowns  and
valuation  allowances.  We  calculate  depreciation  and  amortization  on  a
straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives of the  assets  as  follows:  5
to 25 years  for  buildings  and  improvements,  3 to 20 years for machinery and
equipment and 3 to 7 years for  capitalized  software  costs.  As discussed  above, we
suspend depreciation and amortization on assets related to restaurants that are held for
sale.

Internal  Development  Costs and Abandoned Site Costs.

We capitalize  direct costs
associated  with the site  acquisition  and  construction  of a Company unit on that
site,  including  direct internal  payroll and  payroll-related  costs.  Only  those
site-specific  costs  incurred  subsequent  to the time  that the  site  acquisition  is
considered  probable  are  capitalized.  We consider  acquisition  probable upon final
site approval.  If we subsequently make a determination that a  site for which  internal
development  costs have been  capitalized  will not be acquired  or  developed,  any
previously  capitalized internal development costs are expensed and included in general
and administrative expenses.

Goodwill and Intangible  Assets.

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 141,  “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”).  SFAS 141  requires the use of the purchase
method of accounting for all business  combinations  and modifies the application of the
purchase  accounting  method.  Goodwill  represents  the  excess of the cost of a
business  acquired  over the net of the  amounts  assigned to assets  acquired,
including  identifiable  intangible  assets,  and  liabilities  assumed.  SFAS 141
specifies  criteria  to be  used  in  determining  whether  intangible  assets  acquired
in a  purchase  method  business  combination  must be recognized  and reported
separately  from goodwill.  We base amounts  assigned to goodwill and other  identifiable
intangible assets on independent appraisals or internal estimates.


The Company has also adopted SFAS No. 142,  “Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets” (“SFAS
142”).  SFAS 142 eliminates the  requirement to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived  intangible assets,  addresses the amortization of intangible assets
with a defined  life,  and addresses  impairment  testing and  recognition  for goodwill
and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets.  SFAS 142 applies to goodwill and  intangible
assets  arising from  transactions  completed both before and after  its  effective
date.  As a result of  adopting  SFAS  142,  we  ceased  amortization  of  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  beginning  December  30,  2001.  Prior  to the
adoption  of SFAS  142,  we  amortized  goodwill  on a  straight-line  basis up to 20
years and  indefinite-lived  intangible assets on a straight-line  basis over 3 to 40
years.  Amortizable  intangible  assets continue to be amortized on a straight-line
basis over 3 to 40 years. As discussed above,  we suspend  amortization on those
intangible  assets with a defined life that are allocated to restaurants  that are held
for sale.

In  accordance  with the  requirements  of SFAS 142,  goodwill  has been  assigned  to
reporting  units for  purposes  of  impairment  testing.  Our reporting units are our
operating segments in the U.S. (see Note 23) and our business management  units
internationally  (typically  individual  countries).  Goodwill  impairment  tests
consist of a comparison  of each  reporting  unit’s  fair value with its  carrying
value.  The fair value of a  reporting  unit is the amount for which the  unit as a whole
could be sold in a current  transaction  between willing parties.  We generally  estimate
fair value based  on discounted  cash flows.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value,  goodwill is written down to  its implied fair value.  As
required by SFAS 142, we completed  transitional  impairment  tests of goodwill as of
December  30, 2001,  which  indicated  that there was no  impairment.  We have selected
the  beginning of our fourth  quarter as the  date on which to  perform  our  ongoing
annual  impairment  test.  As a result of the poor  performance  by our Pizza Hut  France
reporting unit from the date of the transitional  impairment test through  September 8,
2002 (the beginning of our  fourth  quarter),  goodwill  assigned  to that  reporting
unit of $5 million was deemed  impaired  and written off in the  fourth quarter.

See Note 12 for further discussion of SFAS 142.

Stock-Based  Employee  Compensation.

At December 28, 2002, the Company had four
stock-based  employee  compensation plans  in effect,  which are  described  more fully
in Note 18. The Company  accounts for those plans under the  recognition  and
measurement  principles of APB Opinion No. 25,  “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related  Interpretations.  No stock-based  employee  compensation
cost is reflected in net income,  as all options  granted under those plans had an
exercise  price  equal to the market  value of the  underlying  common  stock on the date
of grant.  The  following  table  illustrates  the effect on net  income and  earnings
per share if the  Company  had  applied  the fair value  recognition  provisions of SFAS
No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based employee
compensation.

Derivative  Financial  Instruments.

Our policy prohibits the use of derivative
instruments for trading purposes,  and we  have procedures in place to monitor and
control their use. Our use of derivative  instruments  has included  interest rate  swaps
and collars,  treasury locks and foreign  currency  forward  contracts.  In addition,  on
a limited basis we utilize  commodity  futures and options  contracts.  Our interest rate
and foreign currency  derivative  contracts are entered into  with financial institutions
while our commodity derivative contracts are exchange traded.

We account for derivative financial  instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities” (“SFAS
133”). SFAS 133 requires that all derivative  instruments be recorded on the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheet at fair  value.  The  accounting  for  changes in the fair
value  (i.e.,  gains or losses) of a  derivative  instrument is dependent upon whether
the derivative  has been  designated and qualifies as part of a hedging  relationship
and further,  on the type of hedging  relationship.  For derivative  instruments that are
designated and qualify as a fair  value hedge,  the gain or loss on the  derivative
instrument  as well as the  offsetting  gain or loss on the hedged item  attributable  to
the hedged  risk are  recognized  in the  results of  operations.  For  derivative
instruments  that are  designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge,  the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument is  reported  as a  component
of other  comprehensive  income  (loss) and  reclassified  into  earnings in the same
period or  periods  during  which the  hedged  transaction  affects  earnings.  Any
ineffective  portion  of the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument is recorded in
the results of operations  immediately.  For derivative  instruments  not designated  as
hedging  instruments,  the gain or loss is  recognized  in the  results of  operations
immediately.  See Note 16 for a  discussion of our use of derivative  instruments,
management of credit risk inherent in derivative  instruments  and fair  value
information related to debt and interest rate swaps.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.

In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (“FASB”) issued
SFAS No. 143,  “Accounting for Asset  Retirement  Obligations” (“SFAS 143”).
SFAS 143 addresses the financial  accounting and reporting for legal  obligations
associated  with the retirement of tangible  long-lived  assets and the associated asset
retirement  costs.  SFAS 143 is effective for  the  Company for fiscal year 2003.  We
currently  do not  anticipate  that the  adoption of SFAS 143 will have a material
impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,  “Accounting  for Costs  Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities” (“SFAS  146”). SFAS 146 addresses
significant  issues regarding the recognition,  measurement,  and reporting of costs
associated  with exit or disposal  activities,  and nullifies  Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 94-3,  “Liability  Recognition for  Certain  Employee  Termination
Benefits  and Other  Costs to Exit an  Activity  (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred in
a  Restructuring).” Costs  addressed by SFAS 146 include  costs to terminate a
contract that is not a capital  lease,  costs  of  involuntary  employee  termination
benefits  pursuant  to  a  one-time  benefit  arrangement,  costs  to  consolidate
facilities,  and costs to relocate  employees.  SFAS 146 is effective for exit or
disposal  activities  that are initiated  after  December 31,  2002.  Although  SFAS 146
will change the timing of expense  recognition  for certain  costs we incur  while
closing  restaurants or undertaking other exit or disposal  activities,  the timing
difference is not expected to be  significant  in  length.  We do not  anticipate  that
the  adoption  of SFAS  146  will  have a  material  impact  on our  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  “Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and  Disclosure” (“SFAS  148”).  SFAS 148
provides  alternative  methods of transition  for a voluntary  change to the fair value
method of  accounting for  stock-based  employee  compensation  as required by SFAS 123.
In addition,  SFAS 148 amends the disclosure  requirements  of SFAS 123 to require more
prominent  and more  frequent  disclosures  in financial  statements  about the  effects
of stock-based  compensation.  Our disclosure regarding the effects of stock-based
compensation included in these  Notes is in compliance with SFAS 148.

In November  2002,  the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 45,  “Guarantor’s
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and
107 and a rescission of FASB  Interpretation  No. 34” (“FIN 45”).  FIN 45
elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be made by a


guarantor in its interim and annual
financial  statements  about its obligations  under  guarantees  issued.  FIN 45 also
clarifies  that a guarantor is required to recognize,  at inception of a guarantee,  a
liability for the fair value of the  obligation  undertaken.  The  disclosure
requirements  of FIN 45 are  included  in Note 24. The initial  recognition  and
measurement  provisions  are  applicable to guarantees  issued or modified  after
December 31, 2002. As described in Note  24, we have in the past provided  certain
guarantees that would have required  recognition  upon issuance or modification  under
the  provisions  of FIN 45. While the nature of our  business  will likely  result in
issuance of certain  guarantee  liabilities in the future,  we do not anticipate  that
FIN 45 will have a material  impact on the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,  an interpretation  of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46”).
FIN 46  addresses  the  consolidation  of entities  whose  equity  holders have either
(a) not  provided  sufficient  equity at risk to allow the entity to  finance  its own
activities  or (b) do not  possess  certain  characteristics  of a controlling  financial
interest.  FIN 46 requires the  consolidation  of these  entities,  known as  variable
interest  entities  (“VIEs”),  by a primary  beneficiary of the entity. A
primary  beneficiary is the entity, if  any,  that is subject to a majority  of the risk
of loss from the VIEs  activities,  entitled to receive a majority of the  VIEs  residual
returns,  or both.  FIN 46 applies  immediately  to variable  interests in VIEs created
or obtained  after  January 31,  2003.  For  variable  interests  in a VIE created
before  February 1, 2003,  FIN 46 is applied to the VIE no  later than the end of the
first  interim or annual  reporting  period  beginning  after June 15, 2003 (the quarter
ending  September 6, 2003 for the Company).  The Interpretation  requires certain
disclosures in financial statements issued after  January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably
possible that the Company will consolidate or disclose  information  about variable
interest entities when the Interpretation becomes effective.

As discussed  further in Note 24, we have posted $32 million of letters of credit
supporting  our guarantee of franchisee  loan pools.  Additionally,  we have provided a
standby  letter of credit under which we could  potentially  be required to  fund a
portion  (up to $25  million) of one of the  franchisee  loan  pools.  The letters of
credit were issued  under our  existing bank credit  agreement (see Note 14).  These
franchisee  loan pools  primarily  funded  purchases of restaurants  from the Company
and, to a lesser extent,  franchisee  development of new restaurants.  The total loans
outstanding under  these loan  pools were  approximately  $153  million  and $180
million  at  December  28,  2002 and  December  29,  2001,  respectively.  Our  maximum
exposure  to loss as a result of our  involvement  with these  franchisee  loan pools was
$57  million at December 28, 2002. We are in the process of  determining  if we are the
primary  beneficiary  of these VIEs. We  currently  believe  that it is  reasonably
possible  we are the  primary  beneficiary  and thus we would be  required  to
consolidate  these  VIEs,  as they are  currently  structured,  upon FIN 46 becoming
effective  for the  Company.  We are  currently evaluating alternative structures related
to these franchisee loan pools.

The  Company  along  with  representatives  of the  franchisee  groups  of  each of
its  Concepts  has  formed  purchasing  cooperatives  for the purpose of purchasing
certain  restaurant  products and equipment in the U.S. Our equity  ownership  in each
cooperative is generally  proportional to our percentage  ownership of the U.S. system
units for the Concept.  We  are continuing to evaluate  whether any of these
cooperatives are VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46 and, if so, whether  we are the
primary  beneficiary.  We do not  currently  believe  that  consolidation  will be
required  for these  cooperatives as a result of our adoption of FIN 46.

Note 3 - Two-for-One Common Stock Split

On May 7,  2002,  the  Company  announced  that its Board of  Directors  approved  a
two-for-one  split of the  Company’s  outstanding  shares of Common  Stock.  The stock
split was  effected in the form of a stock  dividend  and  entitled  each  shareholder
of record at the close of  business  on June 6, 2002 to receive one  additional  share
for every  outstanding  share of Common Stock held on the record date. The stock dividend
was  distributed  on June 17, 2002,  with  approximately  149  million  shares of common
stock  distributed.  All per share and  share  amounts  in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements have been
adjusted to reflect the stock split.


Note 4 – YGR Acquisition

On May 7, 2002,  YUM completed its  acquisition of YGR. At the date of  acquisition,
YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company  and franchise LJS units,  respectively,  and 127
and 742 company and franchise A&W units,  respectively.  In addition, 133  multibranded
LJS/A&W restaurants  were included in the LJS unit totals.  This  acquisition  was made
to  facilitate  our  strategic  objective  of  achieving  growth  through  multibranding,
where two or more of our  Concepts are operated in a  single restaurant unit.

We paid approximately  $275 million in cash and assumed  approximately $48 million of
bank indebtedness in connection with  the  acquisition  of YGR. The  purchase  price was
allocated to the assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based on  estimates  of
their fair values at the date of  acquisition.  We  determined  these fair values with
the  assistance  of a  third party valuation expert.

The  following  table  summarizes  the fair  values  of YGR’s  assets  acquired
and  liabilities  assumed  at the date of  acquisition.

$275

Of the $250 million in acquired intangible assets, $212 million was assigned to
brands/trademarks,  which have indefinite  lives and are not subject to  amortization.
The  remaining  acquired  intangible  assets  primarily  consist of franchise  contract
rights which will be  amortized  over thirty  years,  the typical term of a YGR
franchise  agreement  including  renewals.  Of the $212 million in  brands/trademarks
approximately $191 million and $21 million were assigned to the U.S.  and  International
operating  segments,  respectively.  Of the $38 million in intangible  assets subject to
amortization,  approximately $31 million and $7 million were assigned to the U.S. and
International operating segments, respectively.

The $209  million in goodwill  was  primarily  assigned to the U.S.  operating
segment.  As we acquired the stock of YGR,  none of the goodwill is expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Liabilities  assumed included  approximately  $48 million of bank  indebtedness  that
was paid off prior to the end of the  second quarter of 2002 and  approximately $11
million in capital lease  obligations.  We also assumed  approximately  $168  million in
present value of future rent  obligations  related to existing  sale-leaseback
agreements  entered into by YGR  involving  approximately  350 LJS  units.  As a result
of liens held by the  buyer/lessor  on  certain  personal  property  within the units,
the sale-leaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings and reflected as debt.

Additionally,  as of the date of  acquisition  we recorded  approximately  $49 million
of  reserves  (“exit  liabilities”)  related to our plans to consolidate
certain support functions,  and exit certain markets through store  refranchisings and
closures,  as presented in the table below.  The  consolidation of certain support
functions  included the termination of  approximately


100 employees.  Plans associated
with exiting certain markets through store  refranchisings and closures are  expected to
be finalized prior to May 7, 2003.  Adjustments to the purchase price  allocation
related to the finalization  of these plans are not expected to be material.  The unpaid
exit  liabilities  as of December 28, 2002 have been reflected  on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as accounts payable and other current  liabilities ($30 million) and other
liabilities  and deferred  credits ($10 million).  Amounts  recorded as other
liabilities and deferred  credits are expected to result  in payments principally in 2004.

Additionally,  we expensed  approximately $6 million of integration  costs related to
the acquisition in 2002. These costs  were recorded as unusual items expense.  See Note 7
for further discussion regarding unusual items (income) expense.

The  results  of  operations  for YGR have  been  included  in our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  since the date of  acquisition.  If the  acquisition
had been  completed  as of the  beginning  of the years  ended  December  28,  2002 and
December 29, 2001, pro forma Company sales, and franchise and license fees would have
been as follows:



Company sales

$7,139

$6,683

Franchise and license fees



The impact of the acquisition,  including interest expense on debt incurred to finance
the acquisition,  on net income and  diluted earnings per share would not have been
significant in 2002 and 2001.

The pro forma  information  is not  necessarily  indicative  of the results of
operations  had the  acquisition  actually  occurred at the beginning of each of these
periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

Note 12 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company’s  business  combinations have included acquiring  restaurants from
our franchisees.  Prior to the adoption of  SFAS  141,  the  primary  intangible  asset
to which we  generally  allocated  value in these  business  combinations  was
reacquired  franchise rights.  We determined that reacquired  franchise rights did not
meet the criteria of SFAS 141 to be  recognized  as an asset  apart from  goodwill.
Accordingly,  on  December  30,  2001,  we  reclassified  $241  million of  reacquired
franchise rights to goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $53 million.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, net for the year ended December 28,
2002 is as follows:

As noted above, on December 30, 2001, we reclassified $241 million of
reacquired franchise rights to goodwill, net of  related deferred tax liabilities of $53
million.

As a result of adopting SFAS 142, we ceased  amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  beginning  December  30,  2001.  Amortization
expense  for  definite-lived  intangible  assets was $6 million in 2002.  Amortization
expense  for  goodwill  and all  intangible  assets  was $37  million  and $38  million
in 2001 and  2000,  respectively.  Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible
assets will approximate $5 million for each of the next five years.

On June 25,  2002,  we  closed  on a new $1.4  billion  senior  unsecured  Revolving
Credit  Facility  (the  “New  Credit  Facility”).  The New Credit  Facility
replaced  the  existing  bank  credit  agreement  which was  comprised  of a senior
unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility  (collectively  referred to as  the “Old Credit  Facilities”) that
were scheduled to mature on October 2, 2002.  Amounts  outstanding under the Old Credit
Facilities were  classified as short-term  borrowings in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet
at December 29, 2001. On December  27, 2002, we  voluntarily  reduced our maximum
borrowing  limit under the New Credit  Facility to $1.2  billion.  The New  Credit
Facility  matures on June 25,  2005.  We used the initial  borrowings  under the New
Credit  Facility to repay the  indebtedness under the Old Credit Facilities.

The New Credit Facility is  unconditionally  guaranteed by our principal  domestic
subsidiaries  and contains other terms  and provisions (including representations,
warranties,  covenants, conditions and events of default) similar to those set  forth in
the Old Credit  Facilities.  Specifically,  the New Credit  Facility  contains  financial
covenants  relating to  maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.  The
New Credit Facility also contains  affirmative and negative  covenants  including,  among
other things,  limitations on certain  additional  indebtedness,  guarantees of
indebtedness,  cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain other
transactions as defined in the agreement.


Under the terms of the New Credit Facility,  we may borrow up to the maximum
borrowing limit less outstanding  letters of  credit.  At December 28, 2002, our unused
New Credit Facility totaled $0.9 billion,  net of outstanding  letters of credit  of $0.2
billion.  The interest  rate for  borrowings  under the New Credit  Facility  ranges from
1.00% to 2.00% over the  London  Interbank  Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or 0.00% to
0.65% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime  Rate or the
Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate  plus 1%.  The  exact  spread  over  LIBOR or the
Alternate  Base  Rate,  as  applicable,  will  depend  upon  our  performance  under
specified  financial  criteria.  Interest  is  payable  at least  quarterly.  In the
third quarter of 2002, we capitalized  debt issuance costs of  approximately  $9 million
related to the  New Credit  Facility.  The costs will be amortized  into  interest
expense over the life of the New Credit  Facility.  At  December  28, 2002,  the
weighted  average  contractual  interest  rate on  borrowings  outstanding  under the New
Credit  Facility was 2.6%.

In 2002,  we expensed  facility fees of  approximately  $5 million,  which was
comprised of $3 million  related to the New  Credit Facility and $2 million related to
the Old Credit  Facilities,  prior to being replaced.  In both 2001 and 2000, we
expensed facility fees of approximately $4 million related to the Old Credit Facilities.

In 1997, we filed a shelf  registration  statement with the  Securities and Exchange
Commission for offerings of up to $2  billion of senior  unsecured  debt. In June 2002,
we issued $400 million of 7.70% Senior  Unsecured Notes due July 1, 2012  (the “2012
Notes”).  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012 Notes were used to repay
indebtedness  under the New  Credit  Facility.  Additionally,  we capitalized debt
issuance costs of approximately $5 million related to the 2012 Notes  in the third
quarter  of 2002.  The  following  table  summarizes  all Senior  Unsecured  Notes
issued  under this shelf  registration through December 28, 2002:

We have $150 million remaining for issuance under the $2 billion shelf registration.

As discussed in Note 4, upon the  acquisition  of YGR, we assumed  approximately  $168
million in present  value of future  rent  obligations  related to certain
sale-leaseback  agreements  entered  into by YGR  involving  approximately  350 LJS
units. As a result of liens held by the  buyer/lessor on certain personal  property
within the units,  the  sale-leaseback  agreements  have been accounted for as financings
and are reflected as debt in our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements as  of December 28,
2002.  Rental  payments made under these  agreements  will be made on a monthly basis
through 2019 with an  effective interest rate of approximately 11%.


The annual  maturities of long-term debt as of December 28, 2002,  excluding  capital
lease obligations of $99 million and  derivative instrument adjustments of $44 million,
are as follows:

Year ended:

Interest  expense on short-term  borrowings  and long-term  debt was $180 million,
$172 million and $190 million in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Net interest
expense of $9 million on  incremental  borrowings  related to the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy
reorganization process was included in unusual items (income) expense in 2000.

Note 15 – Leases

We have  non-cancelable  commitments  under both capital and long-term  operating
leases,  primarily for our restaurants.  Capital and  operating  lease  commitments
expire at various  dates  through  2087 and,  in many cases,  provide for rent
escalations and renewal  options.  Most leases require us to pay related  executory
costs,  which include property taxes,  maintenance and insurance.

Future minimum  commitments  and amounts to be received as lessor or sublessor under
non-cancelable  leases are set forth  below:

Note 16 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Instruments

Interest  Rates

- We enter into  interest  rate swaps and forward  rate  agreements
with the  objective  of reducing  our  exposure to interest rate risk and lowering
interest  expense for a portion of our debt.  Under the  contracts,  we agree  with other
parties to exchange,  at specified  intervals,  the  difference  between  variable rate
and fixed rate amounts  calculated  on a notional  principal  amount.  At both  December
28,  2002 and  December  29,  2001,  we had  outstanding  pay-variable  interest  rate
swaps with notional  amounts of $350 million.  These swaps have reset dates and floating
rate  indices which match those of our  underlying  fixed-rate  debt and have been
designated as fair value hedges of a portion  of that debt. As the swaps qualify for the
short-cut  method under SFAS 133 no  ineffectiveness  has been  recorded.  The  fair
value of these swaps as of December  28, 2002 and December  29, 2001 was  approximately
$48 million and $36 million,  respectively,  and has been  included in other  assets.
The portion of this fair value which has not yet been  recognized  as a reduction  to
interest  expense  (approximately  $44 million and $34 million at December  28, 2002 and
December  29,  2001, respectively) has been included in long-term debt.

During the second  quarter of 2002, we entered into  treasury  locks with notional
amounts  totaling $250 million.  These  treasury locks were entered into to hedge the
risk of changes in future interest  payments  attributable to changes in the  benchmark
interest rate prior to issuance of additional  fixed-rate  debt.  These locks were
designated and effective in  offsetting the  variability in cash flows  associated  with
the future  interest  payments on a portion of the 2012 Notes.  Thus, the  insignificant
loss at which these treasury locks were settled will be recognized as an increase to
interest on  the debt through 2012.

At December 29, 2001,  we had  outstanding  pay-fixed  interest rate swaps with a
notional  amount of $650 million.  These  swaps had been  designated  as cash flow
hedges of a portion of our  variable-rate  debt.  As the  critical  terms of the  swaps
and hedged interest  payments were the same, we determined  that the swaps were
completely  effective in offsetting  the variability in cash flows  associated with
interest  payments on that debt due to interest rate  fluctuations.  During  2002,  due
to decreased  borrowings  under our New Credit  Facility,  interest  rate swaps with a
notional  amount of $150  million were terminated.  An insignificant  amount was
reclassed from accumulated other  comprehensive  income to interest  expense as a result
of this  termination.  The  remaining  interest  swaps with notional  amounts of $500
million  matured  during 2002.

Foreign Exchange

- We enter into foreign  currency  forward  contracts with the
objective of reducing our exposure to cash  flow  volatility  arising  from  foreign
currency  fluctuations  associated  with certain  foreign  currency  denominated
financial  instruments,  the majority of which are intercompany  short-term receivables
and payables. The notional amount,  maturity date, and currency of these  contracts match
those of the underlying  receivables or payables.  For those foreign  currency exchange
forward contracts that we have designated as cash flow hedges, we measure
ineffectiveness  by comparing  the  cumulative  change in the forward  contract with the
cumulative  change in the hedged item. No  ineffectiveness  was  recognized in 2002 or
2001 for those foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

Commodities

- We also  utilize on a limited  basis  commodity  futures and options
contracts to mitigate our exposure to  commodity price  fluctuations  over the next
twelve months.  Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS  133.
Commodity future and options  contracts  entered into for the fiscal years ended December
28, 2002 and December 29,  2001 did not significantly impact the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Deferred Amounts in Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Income (Loss)

- As of December
28, 2002, we had a net deferred loss  associated  with cash flow  hedges of
approximately  $2  million,  net of tax. Of this  amount,  we  estimate  that a net
after-tax loss of less than $1 million will be  reclassified  into earnings  through
December 27, 2003. The remaining net  after-tax loss of  approximately  $2 million,
which arose from the settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the  issuance of
certain  amounts of our fixed-rate  debt,  will be  reclassified  into earnings from
December 28, 2003 through  2012 as an increase to interest expense on this debt.


Credit Risks

Credit risk from  interest  rate swap,  treasury  lock and forward  rate  agreements
and foreign  exchange  contracts  is  dependent  both on movement in interest and
currency  rates and the  possibility  of  non-payment  by  counterparties.  We  mitigate
credit risk by entering into these  agreements  with  high-quality  counterparties,  and
netting swap and forward  rate payments within contracts.

Accounts  receivable  consists  primarily of amounts due from  franchisees and
licensees for initial and continuing  fees.  In  addition,  we have notes and lease
receivables  from certain of our  franchisees.  The  financial  condition of these
franchisees and licensees is largely  dependent upon the underlying  business trends of
our Concepts.  This  concentration  of credit  risk is  mitigated,  in part,  by the
large  number of  franchisees  and  licensees  of each  Concept  and the  short-term
nature of the franchise and license fee receivables.

Fair Value

At  December  28, 2002 and  December  29,  2001,  the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents,  short-term  investments,  accounts  receivable,  and  accounts  payable
approximated  carrying  value  because  of the  short-term  nature of these  instruments.
The fair value of notes receivable approximate carrying value after consideration of
recorded allowances.

The carrying amounts and fair values of our other financial instruments subject to
fair value disclosures are as follows:

Note 17 - Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

Pension Benefits

We sponsor  noncontributory  defined benefit pension plans covering  substantially all
full-time U.S. salaried  employees,  certain hourly  employees and certain  international
employees.  During 2001,  the YUM  Retirement  Plan (the “Plan”) was  amended
such that any  salaried  employee  hired or rehired  by YUM after  September  30,  2001
will not be  eligible  to  participate in the Plan.  Benefits are based on years of
service and earnings or stated amounts for each year of service.

Postretirement Medical Benefits

Our postretirement  plan provides health care benefits,  principally to U.S. salaried
retirees and their dependents.  This  plan includes  retiree cost sharing  provisions.
During 2001, the plan was amended such that any salaried  employee hired  or rehired by
YUM after  September 30, 2001 will not be eligible to  participate  in this plan.
Employees  hired prior to  September  30,  2001 are  eligible  for  benefits  if they
meet age and service  requirements  and qualify for  retirement  benefits.

We have assumed the annual increase in cost of postretirement  medical benefits was
12.0% for both  non-Medicare  eligible  retirees  and  Medicare  eligible  retirees  in
2002 and will be 12.0%  for both in 2003.  We are  assuming  the rates for  non-Medicare
and Medicare  eligible  retirees  will decrease to an ultimate rate of 5.5% by 2011 and
remain at that level  thereafter.  There is a cap on our medical  liability for certain
retirees.  The cap for Medicare  eligible  retirees was  reached in 2000 and the cap for
non-Medicare  eligible  retirees is expected to be reached  between the years  2007-2008;
once the cap is reached, our annual cost per retiree will not increase.

Assumed  health care cost trend rates have a  significant  effect on the amounts
reported for our  postretirement  health  care plans.  A one percent  increase or
decrease  in the  assumed  health care cost trend rates would have  increased  or
decreased  our  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation  at December 28, 2002 by
approximately  $2 million.  The  impact on our 2002 benefit cost would not have been
significant.

Note 18 –Stock-Based Employee Compensation

At year-end  2002,  we had four stock  option plans in effect:  the YUM!  Brands,
Inc.  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan (“1999  LTIP”),  the 1997 Long-Term  Incentive
Plan (“1997 LTIP”), the YUM! Brands,  Inc.  Restaurant General Manager Stock
Option  Plan (“YUMBUCKS”) and the YUM! Brands, Inc. SharePower Plan (“SharePower”).

We may grant  awards of up to 15.2  million  shares and 45.0  million  shares of stock
under the 1999 LTIP and 1997 LTIP,  respectively.  Potential  awards to  employees  and
non-employee  directors  under the 1999 LTIP include  stock  options,  incentive stock
options,  stock appreciation rights,  restricted stock, stock units,  restricted stock
units,  performance  shares and  performance  units.  Potential  awards to employees  and
non-employee  directors  under the 1997 LTIP include  stock  appreciation  rights,
restricted stock and performance  restricted stock units.  Prior to January 1, 2002, we
also  could  grant  stock  options and  incentive  stock  options  under the 1997 LTIP.
We have  issued only stock  options and  performance restricted stock units under the
1997 LTIP and have issued only stock options under the 1999 LTIP.

We may grant stock options under the 1999 LTIP to purchase  shares at a price equal to
or greater than the average  market  price of the stock on the date of grant.  New option
grants under the 1999 LTIP can have varying  vesting  provisions  and  exercise  periods.
Previously  granted  options under the 1997 LTIP and 1999 LTIP vest in periods  ranging
from immediate  to 2006 and expire ten to fifteen years after grant.

We may grant  options to purchase up to 15.0  million  shares of stock under  YUMBUCKS
at a price equal to or greater than  the average  market price of the stock on the date
of grant.  YUMBUCKS  options  granted  have a four year vesting  period  and expire ten
years after grant.  We may grant  options to purchase up to 14.0  million  shares of
stock at a price equal  to or greater  than the  average  market  price of the stock on
the date of grant  under  SharePower.  Previously  granted  SharePower options have
expirations through 2006.


At the  Spin-off  Date,  we  converted  certain of the unvested  options to purchase
PepsiCo  stock that were held by our  employees  to YUM stock  options  under  either the
1997 LTIP or  SharePower.  We  converted  the  options at amounts  and  exercise  prices
that  maintained  the amount of  unrealized  stock  appreciation  that existed
immediately  prior to the  Spin-off.  The vesting  dates and  exercise  periods of the
options were not  affected by the  conversion.  Based on their  original  PepsiCo  grant
date,  these  converted  options vest in periods  ranging from one to ten years and
expire ten to  fifteen years after grant.

We  estimated  the fair value of each  option  grant made  during  2002,  2001 and
2000 as of the date of grant  using the  Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions:

In  November  1997,  we granted  two awards of  performance  restricted  stock  units
of YUM’s  Common  Stock to our Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”).  The
awards  were made  under  the 1997 LTIP and may be paid in Common  Stock or cash at the
discretion of the  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors.  Payment of an
award of $2.7 million was  contingent  upon the CEO’s  continued  employment
through  January 25,  2001 and our attainment of certain  pre-established  earnings
thresholds.  In January  2001,  our CEO received a cash payment of $2.7 million
following  the  Compensation  Committee’s  certification  of YUM’s  attainment
of the  pre-established  earnings  threshold.  Payment of an award of $3.6 million is
contingent  upon his  employment  through  January  25,  2006  and our  attainment  of
certain  pre-established  earnings  thresholds.  The annual expense  related to these
awards  included in earnings was $0.4 million for 2002, $0.5 million for  2001 and $1.3
million for 2000.

Note 19 – Other Compensation and Benefit Programs

We sponsor two deferred  compensation  benefit  programs,  the  Restaurant  Deferred
Compensation  Plan and the Executive  Income  Deferral  Program  (the “RDC Plan” and
the “EID Plan,” respectively)  for  eligible  employees  and  non-employee
directors.

Effective  October 1, 2001,  participants  can no longer defer funds into the RDC
Plan.  Prior to that date,  the RDC Plan  allowed  participants to defer a portion of
their annual salary.  The  participant’s  balances will remain in the RDC Plan
until their scheduled  distribution  dates. As defined by the RDC Plan, we credit the
amounts deferred with earnings based  on the investment  options selected by the
participants.  Investment  options in the RDC Plan consist of phantom shares of  various
mutual funds and YUM Common Stock. We recognize  compensation  expense for the
appreciation or  depreciation,  if  any,  attributable to all investments in the RDC
Plan, and prior to October 1, 2001, for any matching  contributions.  Our  obligations
under the RDC  program as of the end of 2002 and 2001 were $10  million  and $13
million,  respectively.  We  recognized  annual  compensation  expense of less than $1
million in 2002,  $3 million in 2001 and $1 million in 2000 for  the RDC Plan.

The EID Plan  allows  participants  to defer  receipt  of a portion of their  annual
salary and all or a portion of their  incentive  compensation.  As  defined  by the EID
Plan,  we  credit  the  amounts  deferred  with  earnings  based on the  investment
options selected by the participants.  These investment  options are limited to cash and
phantom shares of our  Common Stock.  The EID Plan allows  participants to defer
incentive  compensation to purchase phantom shares of our Common  Stock  at a 25%
discount  from the  average  market  price  at the  date of  deferral  (the  “Discount
Stock  Account”).  Participants  bear the risk of forfeiture of both the discount
and any amounts  deferred to the Discount  Stock Account if  they  voluntarily  separate
from  employment  during the two year vesting  period.  We expense the intrinsic  value
of the  discount over the vesting period.  As  investments  in the phantom  shares of our Common Stock can only be settled in
shares of our Common  Stock,  we do not  recognize  compensation  expense for the
appreciation or the depreciation,  if any, of these  investments.  Deferrals into  the
phantom shares of our Common Stock are credited to the Common Stock Account.

Our cash  obligations  under the EID Plan as of the end of both 2002 and 2001 were $24
million.  We recognized compensation expense of $2
million in 2002, $4 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000 for the EID Plan.

We sponsor a  contributory  plan to provide  retirement  benefits  under the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”)
for eligible U.S.  salaried and hourly  employees.  During 2002,  participants  were able
to elect to  contribute  up to 15% of eligible  compensation  on a pre-tax  basis (the
maximum  participant  contribution  increased  from 15% to 25%  effective  January 1,
2003).  Participants  may  allocate  their  contributions  to one or any  combination  of
10  investment  options  within the 401(k) Plan.  Effective  October 1, 2001,  the 401(k)
Plan was amended  such that the Company  matches 100% of the  participant’s
contribution up to 3% of eligible  compensation  and 50% of the  participant’s
contribution  on the next 2% of eligible  compensation.  Prior to this  amendment,  we
made a discretionary  matching  contribution  equal to a  predetermined  percentage of
each  participant’s  contribution to the YUM Common Stock  Fund. We determined our
percentage  match at the beginning of each year based on the immediate  prior year
performance


of  our Concepts.  All matching  contributions  are made to the YUM Common
Stock Fund. We recognized as  compensation  expense  our total matching contribution of
$8 million in 2002, $5 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000.

Note 20 – Shareholders’ Rights Plan

In July  1998,  our Board of  Directors  declared  a dividend  distribution  of one
right for each  share of Common  Stock  outstanding  as of August 3, 1998 (the “Record
Date”).  As a result of the  two-for-one  stock split  distributed on June  17,
2002,  each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one right for every two shares of
Common Stock  (one-half  right per  share).  Each right  initially  entitles the
registered  holder to purchase a unit consisting of one  one-thousandth  of a  share (a
“Unit”) of Series A Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  without par
value,  at a purchase price of $130 per  Unit,  subject to adjustment.  The rights,
which do not have voting rights,  will become exercisable for our Common Stock  ten
business days  following a public  announcement  that a person or group has  acquired,
or has commenced or intends to  commence a tender  offer for, 15% or more,  or 20% or
more if such person or group owned 10% or more on the adoption  date  of this plan, of
our Common Stock. In the event the rights become  exercisable  for Common Stock,  each
right will entitle  its holder  (other than the  Acquiring  Person as defined in the
Agreement)  to  purchase,  at the  right’s  then-current  exercise  price,  YUM
Common  Stock  having a value of twice the  exercise  price of the  right.  In the event
the rights  become exercisable for Common Stock and thereafter we are acquired in a
merger or other business  combination,  each right  will entitle its holder to purchase,
at the right’s  then-current  exercise price,  common stock of the acquiring company
having a value of twice the exercise price of the right.

We can redeem the rights in their  entirety,  prior to becoming  exercisable,  at
$0.01 per right under certain  specified  conditions.  The rights expire on July 21,
2008,  unless we extend that date or we have earlier  redeemed or exchanged the  rights
as provided in the Agreement.

This  description  of the rights is  qualified  in its  entirety  by  reference  to
the Rights  Agreement  between YUM and  BankBoston, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of
July 21, 1998 (including the exhibits thereto).

Note 21 - Share Repurchase Program

In November  2002,  our Board of Directors  authorized a new share  repurchase
program.  This  program  authorizes  us to  repurchase,  through  November 20, 2004, up
to $300 million  (excluding  applicable  transaction  fees) of our outstanding  Common
Stock.  During 2002, we repurchased  approximately  1.2 million shares for  approximately
$28 million at an average  price per share of  approximately  $24 under this  program.
At December 28,  2002,  approximately  $272 million  remained  available for repurchases
under this program.  Based on market conditions and other factors,  additional
repurchases may  be made from time to time in the open  market or  through  privately
negotiated  transactions  at the  discretion  of the  Company.

In  February  2001,  our  Board of  Directors  authorized  a share  repurchase
program.  This  program  authorized  us to  repurchase  up to $300 million  (excluding
applicable  transaction  fees) of our  outstanding  Common  Stock.  This share
repurchase  program  was  completed  in  2002.  During  2002,  we  repurchased
approximately  7.0  million  shares  for  approximately  $200  million at an average
price per share of  approximately  $29 under this  program.  During  2001,  we
repurchased  approximately  4.8  million  shares  for  approximately  $100  million  at
an  average  price  per  share  of  approximately $21 under this program.

In 1999, our Board of Directors  authorized a share  repurchase  program.  This
program  authorized us to repurchase up to  $350 million  (excluding  applicable
transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock. This share repurchase program was
completed in 2000.  During 2000, we repurchased  approximately  12.8 million shares for
approximately  $216 million at an  average  price  per  share of  approximately  $17.  In
total,  we  repurchased  approximately  19.5  million  shares  for  approximately $350
million at an average price per share of approximately $18 under this program.

Taxes payable were reduced by $49 million,  $13 million and $5 million in 2002, 2001
and 2000,  respectively,  as a result  of stock option  exercises.  In addition,
goodwill and other  intangibles  were reduced by $8 million in 2001 as a result  of the
settlement of a disputed  claim with the Internal  Revenue  Service  relating to the
deductibility  of reacquired  franchise rights and other intangibles offset by an $8
million reduction in deferred and accrued taxes payable.

In 2002,  valuation  allowances  related to deferred tax assets in certain states and
foreign  countries were increased by  $1 million  and $6  million,  respectively,
primarily  as a result of  determining  that it is more  likely than not that  certain
losses would not be utilized prior to expiration.

In 2001,  valuation  allowances  related to deferred tax assets in certain states and
foreign countries were reduced by $9  million ($6 million,  net of federal tax) and $6
million,  respectively,  as a result of making a determination that it is  more likely
than not that these assets will be utilized in the current and future  years.  In 2000,
valuation  allowances  related to deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign
countries  were reduced by $35 million ($23 million,  net of  federal  tax) and $6
million,  respectively,  as a result of making a  determination  that it is more likely
than not that  these assets will be utilized in the current and future years.

The deferred  foreign tax provision  for both 2002 and 2001 included a $2 million
charge to reflect the impact of changes  in statutory tax rates in various  countries.
The impact of statutory rate changes in foreign  countries was less than $1  million in
2000.

A  determination  of the  unrecognized  deferred tax liability for temporary
differences  related to our  investments  in  foreign subsidiaries and investments in
foreign  unconsolidated  affiliates that are essentially  permanent in duration is  not
practicable.

We have  available net operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards  totaling
approximately  $1.3 billion at December 28,  2002 to reduce  future tax of YUM and
certain  subsidiaries.  The  carryforwards  are  related to a number of foreign and
state jurisdictions.  Of these  carryforwards,  $4 million expire in 2003 and $1.1
billion expire at various times between  2004 and 2020.  The remaining carryforwards of
approximately $179 million do not expire.


Note 23 – Reportable Operating Segments

We are  principally  engaged in  developing,  operating,  franchising  and licensing
the worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco  Bell  concepts,  and since May 7, 2002,  the LJS
and A&W concepts,  which were added when we acquired YGR. KFC, Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell,
LJS and A&W operate  throughout  the U.S. and in 88, 85, 12, 5 and 17 countries  and
territories  outside the  U.S.,  respectively.  Our five largest  international markets
based on operating profit in 2002 are China, United Kingdom,  Canada,  Australia and
Korea. At December 28, 2002, we had investments in 10  unconsolidated  affiliates
outside the U.S.  which operate  principally KFC and/or Pizza Hut restaurants.  These
unconsolidated  affiliates operate in Canada,  China,  Japan,  Poland and the United
Kingdom.  Additionally,  we had an  investment in an  unconsolidated  affiliate in the
U.S.  which operates Yan Can restaurants.

We identify our operating  segments based on management  responsibility  within the
U.S. and  International.  For purposes  of applying SFAS No. 131,  “Disclosure About
Segments of An Enterprise and Related  Information” (“SFAS 131”), we
consider  LJS and A&W to be a single  segment.  We  consider  our KFC,  Pizza Hut,  Taco
Bell and LJS/A&W operating  segments to be  similar  and  therefore  have  aggregated
them into a single  reportable  operating  segment.  Within  our  International
operating segment,  no individual country was considered  material under the SFAS 131
requirements  related to information  about geographic areas and therefore, none have
been reported separately.

Note 24 – Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Guarantees

As a  result  of  (a)  assigning  our  interest  in and  obligations  under  real
estate  leases  as a  condition  to the  refranchising of certain Company restaurants;
(b) contributing certain Company restaurants to unconsolidated  affiliates;  and (c)
guaranteeing  certain other leases we are frequently  contingently  liable on lease
agreements.  These leases have  varying terms,  the latest of which expires in 2030. As
of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,  the potential  amount  of  undiscounted
payments we could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary lessee
was $388 million  and $435 million,  respectively.  The present values of these
potential  payments  discounted at our pre-tax cost of debt  at December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001,  were $278 million and $293 million,  respectively.  Current
franchisees  are  the primary  lessees  under the vast majority of these  leases.  We
generally  have  cross-default  provisions  with these  franchisees  that would put them
in default of their franchise  agreement in the event of non-payment  under the lease. We
believe these  cross-default  provisions  significantly  reduce the risk that we will be
required to make  payments  under  these leases.  Accordingly,  the liability  recorded
for our exposure  under such leases at December 28, 2002 and December  29, 2001, was not
significant.

Guarantees Supporting Financial Arrangements of Certain Franchisees,
Unconsolidated Affiliates and Other Third Parties

At December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,  we had  guaranteed  approximately  $32
million of financial  arrangements  of  certain  franchisees,  including  partial
guarantees  of  franchisee  loan  pools  related  primarily  to  the  Company’s
refranchising  programs.  The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were
approximately  $153 million at December  28,  2002.  In support of these  guarantees,  we
have posted $32 million of letters of credit.  We also  provide a


standby  letter of
credit  under  which we could  potentially  be  required  to fund a portion  (up to $25
million)  of one of the  franchisee  loan pools.  Any funding under the  guarantees or
letters of credit would be secured by the  franchisee  loans  and any related
collateral.  We believe that we have  appropriately  provided for our estimated  probable
exposures under  these contingent liabilities.  These provisions were primarily charged
to refranchising (gains) losses.

We have  guaranteed  certain  financial  arrangements  of  unconsolidated  affiliates
and third parties.  These  financial  arrangements  primarily  include  lines of credit,
loans and letters of credit and totaled $41 million and $28 million at  December  28,
2002 and  December  29,  2001,  respectively.  If all such lines of credit and letters of
credit were fully  drawn down, the maximum  contingent  liability under these
arrangements would be approximately $53 million and $56 million  as of December  28,
2002 and  December  29,  2001,  respectively.  We have  varying  levels of  recourse
provisions  and  collateral that mitigate our risk under these guarantees.  Accordingly,
we have no recorded  liability as of December 28,  2002 or December 29, 2001.

Insurance Programs

We are currently  self-insured for a portion of our current and prior years’ workers’ compensation,
employment practices  liability,  general  liability and  automobile  liability  losses
(collectively,  “casualty  losses”) as well as property  losses and certain
other  insurable  risks.  To mitigate  the cost of our  exposures  for certain  property
and casualty  losses,  we make annual  decisions to either  retain the risks of loss up
to certain  maximum per  occurrence or aggregate  loss limits negotiated with our
insurance  carriers,  or to fully insure those risks. Since the Spin-off,  we have
elected  to retain the risks  subject to certain  insured  limitations.  Since August
1999,  we have bundled our risks for casualty  losses,  property  losses and  various
other  insurable  risks  into one pool with a single  self-insured  retention  and
purchased  reinsurance  coverage up to a specified limit that is significantly  above our
actuarially  determined probable  losses. We are self-insured for losses in excess of the
reinsurance  limit;  however,  we believe the likelihood of losses  exceeding the
reinsurance  limit is remote.  We are also  self-insured  for healthcare  claims for
eligible  participating  employees  subject to certain  deductibles and  limitations.  We
have accounted for our retained  liabilities for property  and casualty losses and
healthcare claims,  including reported and incurred but not reported claims,  based on
information  provided by independent actuaries.

Due to the inherent  volatility  of our  actuarially  determined  property and
casualty loss  estimates,  it is reasonably  possible  that we could  experience  changes
in estimated  losses  which could be material to our growth in quarterly  and  annual net
income.  We believe that we have  recorded  our reserves for property and casualty
losses at a level which has  substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of
adverse developments and/or volatility.

Change of Control Severance Agreements

In September  2000, the  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors  approved
renewing  severance  agreements with  certain key executives (the  “Agreements”).
These  Agreements are triggered by a termination,  under certain  conditions,  of the
executive’s  employment  following a change in control of the Company, as defined in
the Agreements.  If triggered,  the  affected  executives  would  generally  receive
twice the amount of both their  annual base salary and their  annual  incentive in a lump
sum, a proportionate  bonus at the higher of target or actual performance,  outplacement
services and  a tax gross-up for any excise taxes.  These Agreements have a three-year
term and  automatically  renew each January 1 for  another  three-year  term unless the
Company elects not to renew the  Agreements.  If these  Agreements had been triggered  as
of  December  28,  2002,  payments  of  approximately  $33  million  would have been
made.  In the event of a change of  control,  rabbi  trusts  would  be  established  and
used to  provide  payouts  under  existing  deferred  and  incentive  compensation plans.


Litigation

We are subject to various claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes,
environmental and other matters arising  out of the normal  course of business.  Like
certain other large retail  employers,  the Company has been faced in certain  states
with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Bravo,
et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Bravo”),  was filed in the  Circuit  Court of the
State of Oregon of the County of  Multnomah.  The  lawsuit was filed by two former  Taco
Bell shift  managers  purporting to represent  approximately  17,000 current and former
hourly  employees  statewide.  The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour
laws,  principally  involving unpaid wages including  overtime,  and  rest and meal
period violations,  and seeks an unspecified amount in damages.  Under Oregon class
action procedures,  Taco  Bell was  allowed an  opportunity  to “cure” the
unpaid  wage and hour  allegations  by opening a claims  process to all  putative  class
members  prior to  certification  of the  class.  In this cure  process,  Taco Bell paid
out less than $1  million.  On January 26, 1999,  the Court  certified a class of all
current and former shift managers and crew members who  claim one or more of the alleged
violations.  A Court-approved  notice and claim form was mailed to approximately  14,500
class  members on January 31, 2000.  Trial began on January 4, 2001.  On March 9, 2001,
the jury reached  verdicts on the  substantive  issues in this matter. A number of these
verdicts were in favor of the Taco Bell position;  however,  certain  issues were
decided in favor of the  plaintiffs.  In April  2002,  a jury trial to  determine  the
damages of 93 of those  claimants  found  that  Taco  Bell  failed to pay for  certain
meal  breaks  and/or  off-the-clock  work for 86 of the 93  claimants.  However,  the
total  amount  of hours  awarded  by the jury was  substantially  less  than that  sought
by the  claimants.  In July and September 2002, the court ruled on several post-trial
motions,  including fixing the total number  of potential  claimants at 1,031  (including
the 93 claimants for which damages have already been  determined) and holding  that
claimants who prevail are entitled to prejudgment  interest and penalty wages.  The court
has indicated that it will  likely  schedule a damages trial for the remaining 938
claimants  sometime in 2003.  Taco Bell intends to appeal the April  2002 damages
verdict, as well as the March 2001 liability verdict.

We have provided for the estimated  costs of the Bravo  litigation,  based on a projection of eligible  claims  (including
claims filed to date, where  applicable),  the amount of each eligible claim,  including the estimated legal fees incurred
by plaintiffs,  and the results of settlement  negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation  matters.  Although
the  outcome of this case  cannot be  determined  at this time,  we believe  the  ultimate  cost in excess of the  amounts
already  provided  will not be  material to our annual  results of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.  Any
provisions have been recorded as unusual items.

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit  against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Wrench LLC,
Joseph  Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco  Bell Corp.

(“Wrench”)  was filed in
the United States  District Court for the Western  District of Michigan.  The lawsuit
alleges that Taco Bell Corp.  misappropriated  certain ideas and concepts used in its
advertising  featuring a Chihuahua.  Plaintiffs seek to recover monetary damages under
several theories,  including breach of  implied-in-fact  contract,  idea
misappropriation,  conversion and unfair  competition.  On June 10, 1999, the District
Court granted  summary  judgment in  favor of Taco Bell Corp.  Plaintiffs  filed an
appeal  with the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit  (the “Court  of
Appeals”),  and oral  arguments  were held on September 20, 2000.  On July 6, 2001,
the Court of Appeals  reversed the  District  Court’s  judgment in favor of Taco
Bell Corp.  and  remanded  the case to the  District  Court.  Taco Bell Corp.
unsuccessfully  petitioned  the Court of Appeals for  rehearing en banc,  and its
petition for writ of  certiorari  to the  United States  Supreme  Court was denied on
January 21, 2002.  The case has now  officially  been returned to the District  Court,
where the Wrench  plaintiffs  will be allowed to bring their claims to trial.  It is
expected  that the trial will  commence in May 2003.

We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and are
vigorously  defending the case.  However,  in view  of the inherent  uncertainties  of
litigation,  the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time.  Likewise,  the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.


Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off

In connection with the Spin-off,  we entered into separation and other related
agreements (the  “Separation  Agreements”)  governing the Spin-off and our
subsequent  relationship  with PepsiCo.  These  agreements  provide certain  indemnities
to  PepsiCo.

The Separation  Agreements provided for, among other things, our assumption of all
liabilities  relating to the restaurant  businesses,  including California Pizza Kitchen,
Chevys Mexican Restaurant,  D’Angelo’s Sandwich Shops, East Side Mario’s
and Hot ’n Now  (collectively  the “Non-core  Businesses”,  which were
disposed of in 1997),  and our  indemnification  of  PepsiCo with respect to these
liabilities. These liabilities were not material as of December 28, 2002.

In  addition,  we have  indemnified  PepsiCo  for any costs or losses it incurs  with
respect  to all  letters of credit,  guarantees and contingent  liabilities  relating to
our businesses under which PepsiCo remains liable.  As of December 28,  2002,  PepsiCo
remains  liable for  approximately  $65 million on a nominal  basis related to these
contingencies.  This  obligation  ends at the time  PepsiCo is released,  terminated  or
replaced by a qualified  letter of credit.  We have not  been required to make any
payments under this indemnity.

Under the Separation  Agreements,  PepsiCo  maintains full control and absolute
discretion with regard to any combined or  consolidated  tax  filings for  periods
through  October 6, 1997.  PepsiCo  also  maintains  full  control  and  absolute
discretion  regarding any common tax audit issues.  Although PepsiCo has  contractually
agreed to, in good faith, use its  best efforts to settle all joint  interests in any
common audit issue on a basis  consistent  with prior  practice,  there  can be no
assurance  that  determinations  made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach,
acting on our own behalf.  Through  December  28,  2002,  there  have not been any
determinations  made by  PepsiCo  where we would  have  reached a  different
determination.

We also agreed to certain  restrictions  on our actions to help ensure that the
Spin-off  maintained its tax-free  status.  These  restrictions,  which were generally
applicable to the two-year period  following  October 6, 1997,  included among  other
things,  limitations  on any  liquidation,  merger or  consolidation  with another
company,  certain  issuances and  redemptions  of our Common  Stock,  our  granting of
stock  options  and our sale,  refranchising,  distribution  or other  disposition  of
assets.  If we failed to abide by these  restrictions  or to obtain waivers from PepsiCo
and, as a result,  the Spin-off  fails to qualify as a tax-free  reorganization,  we may
be obligated to indemnify  PepsiCo for any resulting  tax liability,  which could be
substantial.  No payments under these  indemnities have been required or are expected to
be  required.  Additionally,  PepsiCo is  entitled  to the  federal  income tax  benefits
related to the  exercise  after the  Spin-off of vested PepsiCo  options held by our
employees.  We expense the payroll taxes related to the exercise of these  options as
incurred.

Note 25 - AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process

AmeriServe  was the  principal  distributor  of food and paper  supplies to our U.S.
stores when it filed for  protection  under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code on
January 31, 2000. A plan of  reorganization  for AmeriServe  (the “POR”)  was
approved on November 28, 2000, which resulted in, among other things,  the assumption of
our  distribution  agreement,  subject to certain amendments, by McLane Company, Inc.

During the AmeriServe  bankruptcy  reorganization  process,  we took a number of
actions to ensure continued supply to our  system.  Those  actions  resulted in a
cumulative  net  unusual  items  expense of $110  million,  which was  principally
recorded in 2000, being recorded through year-end 2002.

Under the POR we are entitled to proceeds from certain  residual assets,  preference
claims and other legal recoveries of  the estate which are generally  recorded as unusual
items income when they are realized.  We recorded $39 million and $21  million of net
recoveries  under the POR as unusual  items income in 2002 and 2001,  respectively.
These net  recoveries  are included in the cumulative net unusual items expense of $110
million.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

We are  responsible  for the  preparation,  integrity and fair  presentation  of the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  related  notes and  other  information  included
in this  annual  report.  The  financial  statements  were  prepared  in  accordance
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America and
include  certain amounts  based upon our estimates and  assumptions,  as required.  Other
financial  information  presented in the annual report is  derived from the financial
statements.

We maintain a system of internal  control over financial  reporting,  designed to
provide  reasonable  assurance as to the  reliability  of the  financial  statements,  as
well as to safeguard  assets from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The  system is
supported by formal  policies and  procedures,  including an active Code of Conduct
program  intended to ensure  employees adhere to the highest  standards of personal and
professional  integrity.  Our internal audit function  monitors  and reports on the
adequacy of and compliance  with the internal  control  system,  and  appropriate
actions are taken to  address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities
for improving the system as they are identified.

The Consolidated  Financial Statements have been audited and reported on by our
independent  auditors,  KPMG LLP, who were  given free access to all financial  records
and related data,  including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and
Committees of the Board. We believe that management  representations  made to the
independent  auditors were valid and  appropriate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,  which is composed solely of outside
directors,  provides oversight to our  financial  reporting  process and our  controls
to  safeguard  assets  through  periodic  meetings  with our  independent  auditors,
internal auditors and management.  Both our independent  auditors and internal auditors
have free access to the  Audit Committee.

Although no cost-effective  internal control system will preclude all errors and
irregularities,  we believe our controls  as of December 28, 2002 provide reasonable
assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors

YUM! Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of YUM! Brands,  Inc.
and  Subsidiaries  (“YUM”)  (formerly  TRICON Global Restaurants,  Inc.) as of
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and the related  consolidated  statements  of
income,  cash  flows  and  shareholders’ equity  (deficit)  and  comprehensive
income  for each of the  years in the  three-year  period ended  December 28, 2002.
These  consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of YUM’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards  generally  accepted in
the United States of America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and  perform  the
audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are
free of material  misstatement.  An audit includes  examining,  on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the  amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used  and significant
estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the  financial  position of YUM as of December 28,
2002 and December 29, 2001,  and the results of its  operations and its cash  flows for
each of the years in the three-year  period ended December 28, 2002, in conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  YUM
adopted the  provisions  of the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board’s  Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,  “Goodwill  and Other  Intangible
Assets,” in 2002.

Exhibit 10.20

AMENDED AND RESTATED YUM! PURCHASING CO-OP AGREEMENT

This is an Amended and Restated YUM!  Purchasing Co-op
Agreement (this “Agreement”)  between YUM!  Brands,  Inc.  (together with its
affiliates,  “YUM”) formerly named Tricon Global Restaurants,  Inc., a North
Carolina corporation,  and  the Unified  Foodservice  Purchasing  Co-op, LLC
(“UFPC”),  a Kentucky limited liability  company,  dated as of August 26,  2002.

Recitals

A.

This
Agreement  amends and restates the Tricon  Purchasing  Coop  Agreement  dated March 1,
1999,  as previously  amended on January 25, 2001.  Pursuant to the Yorkshire  SCM
Transfer  Agreement of even date  herewith,  between  YUM and UFPC (the “Yorkshire
Transfer  Agreement”),  YUM is transferring  certain contracts and resources of YUM
associated  with the supply  chain  management  of YUM’s A&W All  American  Food  (“A&W”) and
Long John  Silver’s  (“LJS”)  concepts  (the  “New  Concepts”)  to
UFPC  in  connection  with  the  assumption  of  supply  chain  responsibilities  for A&W and
LJS by UFPC and the  organization of national  purchasing  cooperatives for the New
Concepts (the “New Concept  Co-ops”).  The New Concept  Co-ops are on the date
hereof  wholly owned  subsidiaries  of UFPC.  It is  anticipated,  though not  required,
that the New  Concept  Co-ops  will  become  Operator-owned  cooperatives operating on a
cooperative basis on or about January 1, 2003 (the “Co-op Conversion Date”).

B.

YUM
is  engaged  in  the  franchising  and  operation  of  quick  service  restaurants  and
other  food  outlets  (collectively  “Outlets”)  in the A&W, KFC, LJS,  Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell concepts  (each a “Concept”).  UFPC was  formed  on March 1,
1999 by the KFC  National  Purchasing  Co-op  (the  “KFC  Co-op”),  the Taco
Bell  National  Purchasing  Co-op,  Inc. (the “Taco Bell Co-op”) and the Pizza
Hut National  Purchasing  Co-op,  Inc. (the “Pizza  Hut  Co-op”)  (together
with the New Concept  Co-ops,  the  “Concept  Co-ops”)  in  consultation  with
YUM, as a  cooperative  venture to  administer  purchasing  programs  for the Outlets
operated by YUM and other  members of  Concept Co-ops (“Member  Outlets”).  The
established  programs of the KFC Co-op for KFC franchisees and Taco Bell  franchisees,
and the pilot purchasing program of the KFC Co-op for Pizza Hut franchisees,  were
combined through  UFPC and the Concept Co-ops with the purchasing  programs of YUM’s
Supply Chain Management  (“SCM”).  YUM has the  right to designate  two members
of UFPC’s Board of Directors.  YUM is a member of each of the KFC,  Pizza Hut and  Taco
Bell Concept Co-ops, and will become a member of the New Concept Co-ops on the Co-op
Conversion Date.

C.

This
is the Amended and Restated  YUM!  Purchasing  Co-op  Agreement  mentioned in Section 4.1
of the Amended and  Restated UFPC Operating Agreement of even date herewith (the
“Operating Agreement”).

D.

YUM
has  designated,  and continues to designate,  certain  vendors,  processors  and
manufacturers  as approved  suppliers  (“Approved  Suppliers”) for food,
packaging and


supplies and related services (“Goods”) and equipment  and
related services  (“Equipment”)  used in the system of Outlets (the
“System”)  pursuant to agreements between  YUM and Approved  Suppliers
(“Supplier  Agreements”).  YUM has designated,  and continues to designate,
certain  wholesalers and  distributors  (“Approved  Distributors”)  for
distribution of Goods and Equipment to the System  pursuant to  agreements  between YUM
and Approved  Distributors  (“Distributor  Agreements”).  In  addition,  YUM
entered  into an amended  agreement  with  McLane  Foodservice,  Inc.
(“McLane”)  (the “McLane Agreement”)  as  successor to AmeriServe
Food  Distribution,  Inc.,  granting McLane certain  exclusive  distribution  rights with
respect  to  certain  Outlets  operated  by YUM and  certain  Outlets  sold by YUM to
Pizza  Hut and  Taco  Bell  franchisees.

E.

YUM
and UFPC  entered  into a separate  agreement  dated as of March 1, 1999,  concerning
the transfer by YUM to  UFPC  and the  assumption  by UFPC of  certain  SCM  purchase
contracts  and  arrangements  (the “SCM  Transfer  Agreement”).

F.

The
core mission (the  “Mission”) of UFPC is (a) to assure that  operators of
Outlets  (“Operators”)  receive the  benefit  of  continuously  available
Goods  and  Equipment  in  adequate  quantities  at  the  lowest  possible  sustainable
Outlet delivered prices,  and (b) to coordinate with YUM in YUM’s ongoing  development
and innovation  of Goods and Equipment in support and promotion of each of the Concepts.

G.

Except
as provided in paragraph 5 hereof with respect to the approval of suppliers and
distributors,  nothing in  this Agreement is intended to affect,  limit,  diminish,  or
otherwise modify any of the rights or obligations of  YUM under any franchise or license
agreement entered into with respect to any Outlet  (“Franchise  Agreement”) or
under the McLane Agreement.

H.

Nothing
in this  Agreement or the  Yorkshire  Transfer  Agreement  is meant to take away or
adversely  affect any  rights of a  franchisee  under a LJS or A&W franchise  or license
agreement  to  purchase  Goods and  Equipment  directly from YUM-approved suppliers or
distributors.

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, YUM
and UFPC agree as follows:

l.

Designation.

Upon the terms and  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement and the Operating
Agreement,  YUM hereby  constitutes,  appoints and designates  UFPC, on an exclusive
basis to administer  purchasing  programs on behalf of the Concept Co-ops and otherwise
(the  “Purchasing  Programs”),  as the purchasing  organization  and purchasing
agent for Goods and Equipment  (including Goods and Equipment with respect  to which YUM
has not  designated one or more Approved  Suppliers) for all Outlets  located in the
United  States (the “Area”).  During the term of this  Agreement,  YUM shall
not appoint or authorize any person  or entity,  other than a Concept  Co-op,


to perform
the  Purchasing  Programs or to act as a purchasing  organization  or  purchasing  agent
for the System in the Area  without  UFPC’s  express  prior  written  consent.  YUM
shall  promptly  notify  all  existing  and  future  Approved  Suppliers  and  Approved
Distributors  and System  franchisees of UFPC’s  designation  to perform the Purchasing
Programs as the  purchasing  organization  and  purchasing  agent for the YUM  System and
Outlets in the Area.  YUM also  authorizes  UFPC  on  a  non-exclusive  basis  to
purchase  Goods  and  Equipment,  and  make  purchase  arrangements  for  Goods and
Equipment,  sourced  in the Area for use in the  entire  System  including  Outlets
outside of the Area.  YUM may purchase  Goods and Equipment  sourced in the Area for use
in the  System  outside the Area directly from UFPC or indirectly  under  contracts
negotiated by UFPC provided  YUM pays UFPC fees or margins on each  purchase of Goods and
Equipment  not to exceed those  charged by  UFPC in similar  transactions  involving
Member Outlets or  distributors  serving Member  Outlets.  The  Purchasing  Programs
shall  include all Goods and  Equipment  for all  Outlets in the Area,  except for  items
and  related  services  (such as energy  aggregation  where YUM may be better  positioned
to make  supply  arrangements,  or items and services where UFPC adds no value or service
such as locally sourced  office  supplies and equipment)  which YUM and UFPC or the
applicable  Concept Co-op or Co-ops agree are  not  appropriate  to include  in the
Purchasing  Programs.  The  Purchasing  Programs  include  (i) the  negotiation  of the
price and other terms of purchasing  arrangements  for Goods and Equipment both when
UFPC takes title to Goods and  Equipment  and when it does not,  (ii) the sale of Goods
and Equipment to  Operators and Approved  Distributors,  (iii)  logistics and freight,
(iv) assistance in the negotiation  and monitoring of distribution  arrangements,  and
(v) other supply chain management functions including  cooperation  with YUM’s Brand
Management  function.  Nothing in this Agreement is meant to take away or  adversely
affect  any  rights  of a  franchisee  under a  Franchise  Agreement  to  purchase  Goods
and  Equipment directly from any Approved Supplier or Approved Distributor.

2.

Purchase
Commitment.

During the term of this  Agreement,  YUM shall  purchase  virtually all
Goods and  Equipment for use in YUM operated  Outlets in the Area through the  Purchasing
Programs of UFPC and the  Concept  Co-ops.  "Virtually  all" with  respect to
Goods and  Equipment  means all Goods and  Equipment  except Goods and Equipment:

(a)

Where
UFPC,  or with respect to Outlets of a particular  Concept,  a Concept  Co-op,  agrees in
advance in writing  that YUM need not  purchase  the  particular  item or  category of
Goods or  Equipment through the Purchasing Programs of UFPC;

(b)

Where
YUM  determines  in good  faith,  after  written  notice  to UFPC (or if prior  notice is
impractical  with  notice  given as soon as  possible),  with  respect  to a  specific
item or  category  of Goods or  Equipment  for  specific  Outlets  that


(i) UFPC is
unable to meet YUM’s  required  volume of supply for the  particular  Goods or
Equipment,  or (ii) UFPC is unable to  meet previously established quality standards with
respect to particular Goods or Equipment.

(c)

Where
YUM  determines  in good  faith,  after  written  notice  to UFPC (or if prior  notice is
impractical  with  notice  given as soon as  possible),  that  UFPC’s  purchasing
policies  or  procedures  with respect to the  particular  item or category of Goods or
Equipment  present a  material  business  risk to YUM,  which YUM is unwilling to assume,
because of UFPC’s  volume,  hedging or similar commitments, arrangements or policies, or

(d)

Where
YUM has a  specific  purchase  commitment  (such as  commitments  under  the  AmeriServe
Agreement or with respect to fountain  beverages,  all of which are  specifically  set
forth in  detail on Schedule 1 to this  Agreement)  which YUM is unable as a  practical
matter to assign  to UFPC or which is  inappropriate  for UFPC to assume.  Goods and
Equipment  purchased by YUM  under  commitments  set forth on

Schedule 1

shall not be
deemed to be Goods and  Equipment  for  purposes of this Agreement.

(e)

Where
legal  counsel to YUM has  advised YUM that its  commitments  or the  performance  of its
other duties under this  paragraph  could  reasonably  be expected in a material way to
violate  or breach any applicable material law,  ordinance,  rule or regulation of any
governmental body  or any material judgment,  decree, writ, injunction,  order or aware
of any court, governmental  authority to arbitrative panel; or

(f)

Upon
the proper termination of this Agreement.

3.

Operating
Agreement.

YUM will  abide by the terms of the  Operating  Agreement  applicable  to it.
YUM  confirms  that  pursuant  to the  Yorkshire  Transfer  Agreement  YUM will  bear
certain  of the  costs  associated with the formation and  organization of the New
Concept Co-ops.  YUM acknowledges the Code of  Business Conduct attached to the Operating
Agreement as Annex B.

4.

Concept
Co-ops.

YUM shall  become and remain a  stockholder  member of each of the  Concept
Co-ops in  good  standing  with  respect to all YUM  operated  Outlets in the Area
through the  purchase by YUM of  membership in accordance with the  requirements  and
policies of each Concept Co-op.  YUM shall abide by  the terms of the  Certificate of
Incorporation  and Bylaws of each Concept Co-op as in effect from time  to time. YUM
acknowledges  that basic  decisions  about each restaurant  concept’s  purchasing
program  operations may in the Concept  Co-op’s  discretion be made by each Concept
Co-op,  including  resolution  of such issues as the  Concept  Co-op’s  guidelines  to
UFPC for when to take title and when not to take  title to Goods and


Equipment,  and as
the centralization or decentralization  and geographic location of  Concept purchasing
and program coordination functions.

5.

Approval
Matters.

(a)

As
provided in the  Franchise  Agreements,  YUM shall have the exclusive  right and
obligation  with respect to the purchase and  distribution of Goods and Equipment for the
System  including  without  limitation  to  (i)  designate  and  terminate  Approved
Suppliers  and  Approved  Distributors,  (ii)  designate  approved Goods and  Equipment,
and (iii)  develop,  designate,  modify  and  update  specifications  (including
supplier  product  warranties)  for  Goods and  Equipment.

(b)

However,
YUM shall maintain a supplier  approval and a distributor  approval process which (i)
has  appropriate  and  significant  franchisee,  UFPC and Concept Co-op  involvement,
(ii) has  specific  published  procedures,  anticipated  timetables and provisions for
progress  reports,  (iii)  provides  that  franchisees,  UFPC and the  Concept  Co-ops
may  submit  suppliers  and  distributors  for approval,  and (iv) reflects a
philosophical  commitment to the need in most  circumstances  for  competition  among
Approved  Suppliers and Approved  Distributors  for the  business of Outlets whenever
competition will benefit the System or a Concept.

(c)

Subject
to (i) YUM’s  reasonable  policies  with  respect to trade  secrets and with respect to
confidentiality  undertakings by or to Approved Suppliers and potential  suppliers with
respect  to  proprietary  information  of YUM, an Approved  Supplier or a potential
supplier,  and (ii)  confidentiality  arrangements with Approved  Suppliers binding upon
YUM on the date hereof, YUM  shall make available to Approved  Suppliers and potential
suppliers  specifications  for Goods  and Equipment in  sufficient  detail to encourage
suppliers to apply for approval  without the  need to re-engineer Goods and Equipment.

(d)

All
Supplier  Agreements and  Distributor  Agreements  entered into after the date hereof
shall  note the designation by YUM of UFPC to conduct the Purchasing Programs.

6.

Sheltered
Income.

Neither YUM nor UFPC shall,  directly or  indirectly,  receive or benefit  from
(nor  shall either  authorize  any Approved  Supplier,  Approved  Distributor  or Concept
Co-op,  directly or  indirectly,  to receive or benefit from) any  “Sheltered
Income” in connection  with Goods or Equipment  purchased or used by Outlets in the
Area, except for:


(a)

Marketing
or  promotional  allowances  (i)(A)  provided  outside the ordinary  course which are
approved by UFPC and any  applicable  Concept Co-op or Co-ops,  or (B) provided in the
ordinary  course,  and (ii) which are distributed or  administered  for the benefit of
Operators pro rata  based on the volume of the Operators’ purchases;

(b)

Discounts,
rebates or allowances  which directly lower Member Outlet delivered prices pro rata
among Operators based on the volume of the Operators’ purchases;

(c)

Higher
prices for Goods or Equipment  permitted  or charged by Approved  Suppliers to amortize
Supplier  expenses  related  to  research  and  development  of  Goods  and  Equipment
if such  amortization  of research and  development  expenses is incurred after YUM
receives the advance  advice and  written  consent  (with such  consent  not to be
withheld  if the  parties  hereto  determine in good faith that the expenses to be
incurred  are both  reasonable  and in the best  interests  of the  System of any
Concept  Co-op) of UFPC or the  applicable  Concept  Co-op or  Co-ops;

(d)

Reasonable
fees, in no event exceeding YUM’s  applicable  direct expense,  and not necessarily
completely  reimbursing  YUM’s  direct  expense in  connection  with the  applicable
activity,  charged by YUM, in accordance  with  published  schedules  adopted with the
advance  advice and  written  consent (with such consent not to be withheld if the
parties hereto  determine in good  faith that the expenses to be incurred  are both
reasonable  and in the best  interests of the  System or any Concept  Co-op) of UFPC and
the  applicable  Concept Co-op or Co-ops to potential  suppliers and distributors and to
Approved Suppliers and Approved  Distributors,  in connection  with the YUM supplier
approval and distributor  approval  processes,  or in connection with YUM  administered
quality inspection and assurance programs;

(e)

Sheltered
Income  specifically,  completely  and  timely  disclosed  to  UFPC  not  less  than
quarterly which YUM has permitted  McLane to retain under the McLane  Agreement with
respect to  Goods and Equipment purchased or distributed by McLane for YUM operated
Outlets;

(f)

Reasonable
and customary  gifts and  entertainment  permissible  under UFPC’s Code of Business
Conduct as in effect from time to time under the Operating Agreement; or

(g)

Sheltered
Income expressly  authorized by both YUM and UFPC or the applicable  Concept Co-op or
Co-ops such as higher  prices  permitted to amortize  the cost of excess  inventory or
graphics  and other product changes.


As used
in this  Agreement, “Sheltered Income” means so called  earned  income,
rebates,  kick-backs,  volume discounts, tier pricing, purchase commitment discounts,
sales and service allowances,  marketing  allowances,  advertising  allowances,
promotional  allowances,  label  allowances,  back-door  income,  application fees,
inspection fees,  quality assurance fees, etc., and includes,  among other items, (a)
fees charged  suppliers and  distributors in the supplier and  distributor  approval
process,  (b) fees  charged  suppliers and  distributors  for quality  inspections  and
“hot line” inquiries and complaints,  (c) license or trademark  fees or rebates
charged or expected as a condition of supplier or distributor  approval or use,
typically  paid as a percentage  of System wide volume,  (d) higher  prices  permitted
suppliers to amortize  research and development  expenses  undertaken by suppliers at the
request of YUM  or  otherwise,  (e) higher  prices  permitted  suppliers to amortize the
cost of excess  inventory,  (f)  higher  prices  permitted  suppliers  to amortize the
cost of graphics and other  product  changes,  (g)  special or atypical payment terms,
(h) payments and allowances to distributors  from suppliers based on  distributor  volume

special favors, gifts and entertainment.

Nothing in
this  Agreement  shall be  construed to limit or prohibit the right or ability of UFPC or
any  Concept  Co-op to receive or benefit from any  Sheltered  Income;  provided  that
UFPC shall share,  and  shall cause each Concept Co-op to share,  such  Sheltered  Income
or the benefit  thereof pro rata among  each  applicable  Operator  (including YUM) based
on the dollar volume of the purchases of such Operator  that gave rise to the receipt or
benefit of such Sheltered Income.

7.

Approved
Distributors and Suppliers.

(a)

YUM
acknowledges  and agrees that UFPC may require,  and YUM from the date hereof shall use
its  reasonable  efforts  to  require of all  distributors,  including  McLane,  as a
condition  of  approval as an Approved  Distributor,  that the Approved  Distributor
enter into a Distributor  Participation  Agreement  (“DPA”)  with UFPC in
UFPC’s form of DPA as amended from time to time  providing  among other  matters (a) that
the Approved  Distributor  will comply with all of the  terms of any agreements between
the Approved  Distributor and Member Outlet Operators,  (b) for  the payment by the
distributor  to UFPC of a service  charge as a percentage  of all Goods and  Equipment
purchased by the distributor  from suppliers under  arrangements  negotiated by UFPC  as
part of the  Purchasing  Programs,  (c) for  compliance  by the  Approved  Distributor
with  UFPC’s  reasonable  credit  standards and policies as in effect from time to time,

UFPC to administer  its distributor  performance  monitoring and patronage dividend
programs,  and (e)


prohibitions  on the retention by the Approved  Distributor  of
Sheltered  Income.  YUM  acknowledges  UFPC’s  current  standard form of DPA which shall
not be amended in any material  respect without YUM’s  consent which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld.  YUM will hold UFPC and the Concept  Co-ops  harmless and
indemnify  them from any liability,  loss or expense  incurred by any of them as a
result of claims by McLane,  AmeriServe or their  affiliates or any other Approved
Distributor  designated by YUM as a result of UFPC’s role in conducting  the  Purchasing
Programs,  or as a  result of UFPC doing business in the manner  requested by YUM with
McLane,  AmeriServe or their  affiliates  or any  other  Approved  Distributor
designated  by YUM  for  distribution  to YUM  operated  Outlets or Outlets sold by YUM
to franchisees  obligated to use McLane or AmeriServe;  provided,  however,  that YUM
will not be obligated to indemnify UFPC or the Concept Co-ops (i)  for  losses  resulting
from  the sale of  Goods  and  Equipment  directly  by UFPC to  McLane,  AmeriServe  or
their  affiliates  or  another  Approved  Distributor  other  than  such  sales
requested in writing by YUM, or (ii) for losses resulting from UFPC’s gross negligence.

(b)

YUM
acknowledges  and agrees that UFPC may require,  and YUM from the date hereof shall use
its  reasonable  efforts to require  all  suppliers,  as a  condition  of  approval  as
an  Approved  Supplier,  to enter into a Supplier Business  Relationship  Agreement
("SBRA") with UFPC in the  form currently  endorsed by YUM as amended from time
to time by UFPC with YUM’s consent,  which  consent shall not  unreasonably  be withheld.
YUM and UFPC agree that the SBRA shall  provide,  among other  matters (a) that the
Approved  Suppliers  will comply with all of the terms of any  agreements  between the
Approved  Supplier  and YUM and at all  relevant  times  maintain  its  Approved
Supplier  status  within the YUM system,  (b) that,  if requested  by UFPC,  supplier
shall  collect  and remit to UFPC a sourcing  fee as a  percentage  of all Goods and
Equipment  sold  by the  supplier  to  Operators  under  arrangements  negotiated  by
UFPC as part of the  Purchasing  Programs,  (c)  that  the  Approved  Supplier  will
only  permit  UFPC-designated  purchasers to purchase  Goods and Equipment on the terms
of the SBRA,  (d) for the provision by  the Approved  Supplier to UFPC of  information
necessary for UFPC to  administer  its supplier  performance  monitoring and patronage
dividend  programs,  (e) that the Approved Supplier shall  warrant its Goods and
Equipment  and maintain  insurance as required by YUM, (f)  prohibitions  on the payment
by the Approved  Supplier of Sheltered  Income,  (g) appropriate  indemnities of  UFPC
and  Operators  by the  Approved  Supplier  for  breaches  of the  SBRA,  and (h) that
the  Approved Supplier adhere to YUM-required recalls or retrofits of Goods and Equipment.

YUM and UFPC each acknowledge that as  a
consequence  of their  relationship  with each other and the  Purchasing  Programs,
trade secrets and  information of a proprietary  or  confidential  nature  relating to
the business of YUM and the business  of UFPC and the Concept Co-ops may be disclosed to

or  publicly outside of YUM and UFPC (collectively “Confidential Information”).

(a)

YUM
and UFPC each  acknowledge  that such  Confidential  Information  is generally not known
in  the trade, and is of considerable  importance to YUM and UFPC and the Concept Co-ops,
and each  agree  that  their  relationship  to each  other  with  respect  to such
information  shall be  fiduciary  in nature.  YUM and UFPC  expressly  agree that  during

of its  respective businesses (it being understood that such directors,  officers,
employees, advisors  and agents will be informed of the  confidential  nature of such
information) or to any rating  agency,  (iii) in the  course of any  litigation  or court
proceeding  involving  YUM and UFPC  concerning  this  Agreement  and (iv) for

voluntary or  involuntary,  directly or  indirectly,  individually,  in a partnership  or
joint  venture,  or  through a corporation  as  proprietor,  employee,  stockholder  or
consultant,  or through any  other  business  entity or by any other  means,  enter into
agreement  (except with respect to  such  agreements  after  termination  of this
Agreement as required to assure an orderly supply  of Goods and Equipment)  with or
solicit the  employment of any present or former  employees of  each other for the

During
the term of this Agreement,  YUM shall not at any time, directly or indirectly,  compete

entered into between  YUM and UFPC and the Concept Co-ops  dated the date hereof.

12.

Representations.

YUM and UFPC each represent and warrant to the other as follows:

(a)

It
is a corporation or limited  liability  company duly  organized  under the laws of its
state  of  incorporation  or  organization.  It has full  capacity,  right,  power  and
authority  to  execute and deliver this Agreement and each other  Transaction  Document
to which it is a party  and to perform its obligations  under this Agreement and each
such Transaction  Document.  This  Agreement  and each other  Transaction  Document to
which it is a party  constitutes  its valid  and legal  binding  obligation  and is
enforceable  against  it in  accordance  with its terms  except as may be limited  by
bankruptcy,  insolvency,


reorganization,  moratorium  or similar  laws relating to or
limiting  creditors’ rights generally or by equitable  principles  relating  to
enforceability.  The  execution and delivery of this  Agreement and each other
Transaction  Document  to  which  it is a  party  and  the  consummation  and  conduct
of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  have  been  approved  by  all  necessary
action  under  applicable  laws  governing it and any of its governing instruments.

(b)

The
execution and delivery of this  Agreement and each other  Transaction  Document to which
it  is a party, the consummation and conduct of the transactions  contemplated  hereby
and thereby,  and  the  performance  and  fulfillment  of its  obligations  and
undertakings  hereunder  and  thereunder  by it will not violate any  provision of, or
result in the breach of, or accelerate  or  permit  the  acceleration  of any
performance  required  by  the  terms  of its  governing  instruments, any contract,
agreement,  arrangement or undertaking to which it is a party or by  which it is bound;
any judgment,  decree, writ,  injunction,  order or award of any arbitration  panel,
court or governmental  authority;  or any applicable law, ordinance,  rule or regulation
of any governmental body.

(c)

There
are  not  claims  of  any  kind  of  actions,  suits  proceedings,  arbitrations  or
investigations  pending  or  to  its  knowledge,  threatened  in  any  court  or  before
any  governmental  agency or  instrumentality or arbitration panel or otherwise relating
to it which  would  interfere  with the  consummation  or conduct of the  transaction
contemplated  by this  Agreement  or any  other  Transaction  Document,  or the
performance  and  fulfillment  of its  obligations and undertakings hereunder.

(d)

No
consents,  approvals,  no  authorizations,  releases or orders are required of or by it
for  the  authorization  of, execution and delivery of, and for the performance and
consummation and  conduct of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

“Transaction  Document”
means  this  Agreement,  the  Operating  Agreement,  the  Program  Management
Agreements,  the Asset Contribution and Liability Assumption Agreement,  the SCM Transfer
Agreement, and  the Yorkshire Transfer Agreement.

13.

Dispute
Resolution.

YUM and UFPC shall each  appoint  one or more  executives  who will meet
with each  other for the purpose of resolving any claim,  dispute or controversy
(“Dispute”)  between YUM and UFPC  arising out of or relating to the
performance of this Agreement,  or any other Transaction  Document, or  the conduct of
the Purchasing  Programs.  If the Dispute is not resolved by negotiation  within 30 days,
the parties shall  endeavor to settle the Dispute by mediation  under the then current
Center for Public  Resources  (“CPR”) Model Procedure for Mediation of


Business
Disputes.  The neutral third party will be  selected  from the CPR panel of neutral
parties with the  assistance  of CPR,  unless the parties agree  otherwise.  In the event
that the parties are  unsuccessful in resolving the dispute via mediation,  the  parties
agree promptly to resolve any dispute  through  binding  confidential  arbitration
conducted in  Louisville,  Kentucky,  in  accordance  with  the  then  current  rules  of
the  American  Arbitration  Association  (“AAA”).  In regard  to such
arbitration,  each  party  shall be  entitled  to select  one  arbitrator  and the
arbitrators  selected by the parties shall select a third  arbitrator.  The parties
irrevocably  consent to such  jurisdiction for purposes of the arbitration,  and judgment
may be entered  thereon in any state or federal  court in the same manner as if the
parties were  residents of the state  of federal  district in which that judgment is
sought to be entered.  The arbitrator  shall not make any  award or decision that is not

ten  years from the Grant  Date and shall  become  100%  vested  four  years from the
Grant Date or as  otherwise  prescribed  by the  Committee  under the terms of the

initially  exercisable,  they shall be carried forward and be exercisable  until  the
expiration of the term of such Stock Options, subject to the provisions of Sections 6(e)
and (f) hereof.


(c)

Exercise
of Option.

To  exercise an Option,  the holder  thereof  shall give notice of his or
her exercise to YUM,  or its agent,  specifying  the number of shares of Common  Stock
to be purchased  and  identifying  the specific  Options that are being  exercised.  From
time to time, the Committee may establish  procedures  relating to  effecting  such
exercises.  No  fractional  shares  shall be issued as a result of  exercising an Option.
An Option is exercisable  during a  Participant’s  lifetime only by the  Participant,
provided,  however,  that in the event the Participant is incapacitated and unable to
exercise Options, such  Options may be exercised by such  Participant’s  legal guardian,
legal  representative,  fiduciary or other  representative whom the Committee deems
appropriate based on applicable facts and circumstances.

(d)

Payment
of Option  Exercise  Price.

The Option  Exercise Price for the Options being exercised
must be paid in full at time of issuance of the Common  Stock.  In addition,  in order to
enable the Company  to meet any applicable  foreign,  federal (including FICA), state and
local withholding tax requirements,  a  Participant  shall also be  required to pay the
amount of tax to be  withheld  at the time of  exercise.  No  share of Stock will be
delivered to any Participant until all such amounts have been paid.

(e)

Effect
of  Termination  of  Employment,  Disability  or Death.

No Option may be exercised by a
Participant  after the  termination  of his or her  employment  with the Company,  except
that:  (i) if such  termination  occurs by reason of the  Participant’s  death,  all
Options then held by the Participant  shall  become immediately  exercisable as of the
date of death and may be exercised by such Participant’s  executor  (or, if none,  his or
her legal  representative)  until the  expiration of such Options in  accordance  with
their terms; (ii) if such termination occurs by reason of the Participant’s  becoming
Totally Disabled,  all  Options then held by the  Participant  shall not terminate but
shall continue to be outstanding  and be able  to be exercised by the  Participant in
accordance with their terms until the earlier of the cessation of the  condition  causing
the Participant to be totally  disabled or the expiration of such options;  (iii) if such
termination  occurs by reason of the  Participant’s  Retirement,  all Options  then held
by the  Participant  shall  become  immediately  exercisable  as of the  date of such
Retirement  and  may be  exercised  by the  Participant  until  the  expiration  of such
Options  in  accordance  with  their  terms;  and (iv) if such  termination  is
voluntary  by the  employee or is by action of the Company  (except as described in
Section  6(f) hereof),  all Options then held by the  Participant  which are  exercisable
at the date of termination  shall  continue to be  exercisable  by the  Participant
until the earlier of 90 days after such date or the  expiration of such Options in
accordance  with their terms,  and all Options  which are not  exercisable  at  such date
shall automatically terminate and lapse, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.

(f)

Misconduct.

In the  event  that a  Participant  has  (i)  used  for  profit  or  disclosed  to
unauthorized persons,  confidential  information or trade secrets of the Company, (ii)
breached any contract  with or  violated  any  fiduciary  obligation  to the  Company,
(iii)  engaged in  unlawful  trading in the  securities  of YUM or of another  company
based on  information  gained as a result of that  Participant’s  employment  with the
Company,  or (iv)  committed a felony or other  serious  crime,  then that  Participant
shall forfeit all rights to any  unexercised  Options  granted under the Plan and all of
that  Participant’s  outstanding Options shall automatically terminate and lapse, unless
the Committee shall determine otherwise.


(g)

Nontransferability
of Options.

During a Participant’s  lifetime,  his or her Options shall not  be
transferable  and shall only be exercisable by the  Participant and any purported
transfer shall be null  and void.  No Option shall be transferable other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.

7.

Amendment.

The  Committee  may, at any time,  amend,  suspend or terminate  the Plan,  in whole or
in  part,  provided that no such action shall  adversely  affect any rights or
obligations  with respect to any grants  theretofore  outstanding  hereunder.  The
Committee  may amend the terms and  conditions  of  outstanding  Options,  provided,
however,  that (i) no such  amendment  shall be adverse  to the  holders  of the
Options,  (ii) no such  amendment  shall  extend the period for exercise of an Option,
and (iii) the amended  terms of the Option would be  permitted under this Plan.

8.

Foreign
Employees.

Without  amending the Plan,  the Committee may treat Options  granted to
eligible  employees who are foreign  nationals on such terms and conditions  different
from those  specified in this Plan as  may in the judgment of the  Committee be necessary
or desirable to foster and promote  achievement  of the purposes  of the  Plan,  and,  in
furtherance  of such  purposes  the  Committee  may make such  modifications,
amendments,  procedures,  subplans and the like as may be necessary  or  advisable  to
comply with  provisions  of laws in other  countries in which the Company  operates or
has employees.  The Committee  shall have the authority to adopt plans,  supplemental to
this Plan,  covering  employees  residing  outside the United States,  including but not
limited to  the United Kingdom.

9.

Registration,
Listing and  Qualification  of Shares.

Each Option shall be subject to the requirement
that if at any time the Committee shall determine that the  registration,  listing or
qualification  of the shares  covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any
foreign,  federal,  state or local law, or the consent or  approval of any  governmental
regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with,  the
granting  of such Option or the  purchase of shares  thereunder,  no such Option may be
exercised  unless and  until such registration,  listing, qualification,  consent or
approval shall have been effected or obtained free of  any condition not  acceptable to
the  Committee.  Any person  exercising an Option shall make such  representations  and
agreements and furnish such  information as the Committee may request to assure
compliance  with the foregoing  or any other applicable legal requirements.

10.

Buy
Out of Option  Gains.

At any time  after any Stock  Option  becomes  exercisable,  the
Committee  shall have the right to elect,  in its sole  discretion  and without the
consent of the holder  thereof,  to cancel  such  Option and to cause YUM  to pay to the
Participant  the  excess of the Fair  Market  Value of the shares of  Common  Stock
covered by such  Option  over the Option  Exercise  Price of such  Option at the date the
Committee  provides  written  notice (the “Buy Out Notice”) of its  intention
to exercise  such right.  Buy outs  pursuant to  this  provision  shall be effected by
YUM as promptly as possible  after the date of the Buy Out Notice.  Payments  of buy out
amounts may be made in cash,  in shares of Common  Stock,  or partly in cash and partly
in Common Stock,  as the Committee  deems  advisable.  To the extent payment is made in
shares of Common Stock,  the number of shares  shall be  determined  by  dividing  the
amount of the  payment to be made by the Fair  Market  Value of a share of  Common Stock
at the date of the Buy Out Notice.  In no event shall YUM be required to deliver a
fractional  share  of Common  Stock in  satisfaction  of this buy out  provision.
Payments of any such buy out amounts  shall be made  net of any applicable foreign,
federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes.


11.

Adjustment
for  Change  in Stock  Subject  to Plan.

In the event of any  change  in the
outstanding  shares of Common  Stock by reason of any stock  split,  stock  dividend,  or
other  increase  or decrease in shares  effected  without the receipt of  consideration
by the Company or other similar  corporate  change,  such equitable  adjustments  may be
made in the Plan and the Options  granted  hereunder as the Committee  determines are
necessary  or  appropriate,  including,  if necessary,  an adjustment in the number of
shares and Option  Exercise  Prices per  share  applicable  to Options then  outstanding
and in the number of shares which are reserved for issuance  under  the Plan.  The
Committee  may also make the  foregoing  changes and any other  changes,  including
changes in the  classes of  securities  available,  to the extent it is deemed  necessary
or  desirable  to preserve  the intended  benefits  of the  Plan  for  the  Company
and the  Participants  in the  event  of any  other  reorganization,  recapitalization,
merger,  consolidation,  spin-off,  extraordinary  dividend  or other  distribution  or
similar  transaction.  Any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes of the Plan.

12.

No
Rights to Options or  Employment.

No employee or other  person shall have any claim or
right to be  granted an Option  under the Plan.  Having  received an Option  under the
Plan shall not give an employee any right  to  receive  any other  grant  under the Plan.
A  Participant  shall have no rights to or  interest  in any Option  except as set forth
herein.  Neither the Plan nor any action  taken  hereunder  shall be  construed  as
giving any  employee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.

13.

Rights
as  Shareholder.

A  Participant  under  the Plan  shall  have no rights as a holder of
Common  Stock with  respect to Options  granted  hereunder,  unless and until
certificates  for shares of Common Stock are  issued to such Participant.

14.

Assignment.

Except as otherwise  provided in an award  summary,  no Stock Option shall be  assignable
or  transferable  except  by will or by the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution  and
during  the  lifetime  of a  Participant,  the Stock Option shall be  exercisable  only
by such  Participant or such  Participant’s  guardian or  legal representative.

15.

Other
Actions.

This Plan shall not restrict the  authority of the  Committee or of YUM,  for
proper  corporate  purposes,  to grant or assume  stock  options,  other  than  under the
Plan,  to or with  respect to any  employee or other person.

2001,  employees of YUM (other than officers subject to  Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) are eligible to receive option grants.

6.

Terms
and  Conditions  of Options.

Each Option  outstanding  hereunder  shall be in writing
and shall  contain the following terms and conditions:

(a)

Option
Exercise  Price.

The Option  Exercise Price shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of
a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.

(b)

Term
and Exercise  Dates.

Options  granted  hereunder  shall have a term of no longer than
ten  years from the Grant Date and shall vest in  accordance  with the terms of their
grant.  A grant of Options  may vest in installments,  however,  Stock Options must be
exercised for full shares of Common Stock. To the  extent that Stock Options are not
exercised when they become  initially  exercisable,  they shall be carried  forward  and
be  exercisable  until  the  expiration  of the  term of such  Stock  Options,  subject
to the  provisions of Sections 6(e) and (f) hereof.

(c)

Exercise
of Option.

To  exercise an Option,  the holder  thereof  shall give notice of his or
her exercise to YUM,  or its agent,  specifying  the number of shares of Common  Stock
to be purchased  and  identifying  the specific  Options that are being  exercised.  From
time to time the Committee may establish  procedures  relating to  effecting  such
exercises.  No  fractional  shares  shall be issued as a result of  exercising  an
Option.  An Option  is  exercisable  during an  Optionee’s  lifetime  only by the
Optionee,  provided,  however,  that in the event the Optionee is incapacitated  and
unable to exercise  Options,  such  Options may be  exercised  by such  Optionee’s  legal
guardian,  legal  representative,  fiduciary or other  representative whom the Committee
deems appropriate based on applicable facts and circumstances.

(d)

Payment
of Option  Exercise  Price.

The Option  Exercise Price for the Options being exercised
must be paid in full at time of issuance of the Common  Stock.  In addition,  in order to
enable the Company  to meet any applicable foreign,  federal (including FICA), state and
local withholding tax requirements,  an  Optionee  shall also be required to pay the
amount of tax to be withheld at the time of  exercise.  No share  of Stock will be
delivered to any Optionee until all such amounts have been paid.

(e)

Effect
of  Termination  of  Employment,  Disability or Death.

No Option may be exercised by an
Optionee  after  the  termination  of his or her  employment  with the  Company,  except
that:  (i) if such  termination  occurs by reason of the  Optionee’s  death,  all Options
then held by the Optionee shall become  immediately  exercisable  as of the date of death
and may be exercised by such  Optionee’s  executor (or, if  none, his or her legal
representative) until the expiration of such Options in accordance with their terms;
(ii) if such  termination  occurs by reason of the Optionee’s  becoming Totally
Disabled,  all Options then  held by the Optionee  shall  continue to become  exercisable
and be able to be exercised by the Optionee in  accordance with their terms;  (iii) if
such termination occurs by reason of the Optionee’s  Retirement,  all  Options then held
by the Optionee shall become  immediately  exercisable  as of the date of such
Retirement  and may be exercised by the Optionee  until the  expiration of such Options
in accordance  with their terms;  and (iv) if such  termination  is  voluntary  by the
employee  or is by action of the  Company  (except  as  described in Section 6(f)
hereof),  all Options then held by the Optionee which are  exercisable at the date  of
termination  shall  continue to be  exercisable  by the Optionee until the earlier of 90
days after such  date or the expiration of such Options in accordance with their terms
and all Options which are not  exercisable  at such date shall  automatically  terminate
and lapse,  unless the Committee  shall  determine  otherwise.

(f)

Misconduct.

In  the  event  that  an  Optionee  has  (i)  used  for  profit  or  disclosed  to
unauthorized persons,  confidential  information or trade secrets of the Company, (ii)
breached any contract  with or  violated  any  fiduciary  obligation  to the  Company,
(iii)  engaged in  unlawful  trading in the  securities  of YUM or of  another  company
based on  information  gained as a result  of that  Optionee’s  employment  with the
Company,  or (iv) committed a felony or other serious  crime,  then that Optionee shall
forfeit all rights to any unexercised Options granted under the Plan and all of that
Optionee’s  outstanding  Options shall automatically terminate and lapse, unless the
Committee shall determine otherwise.


(g)

Nontransferability
of Options.

During an  Optionee’s  lifetime,  his or her Options shall not  be
transferrable and shall only be exercisable by the Optionee and any purported  transfer
shall be null and  void.  No Option shall be transferrable other than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution.

7.

Amendment.

The  Committee  may, at any time,  amend,  suspend or terminate  the Plan,  in whole or
in  part,  provided that no such action shall  adversely  affect any rights or
obligations  with respect to any grants  theretofore  outstanding  hereunder.  The
Committee  may amend the terms and  conditions  of  outstanding  Options,  provided,
however,  that (i) no such  amendment  shall be adverse  to the  holders  of the
Options,  (ii) no such  amendment  shall  extend the period for exercise of an Option,
and (iii) the amended  terms of the Option would be  permitted under this Plan.

8.

Foreign
Employees.

Without  amending the Plan,  the Committee may treat Options  granted to
eligible  employees who are foreign  nationals on such terms and conditions  different
from those  specified in this Plan as  may in the judgment of the  Committee be necessary
or desirable to foster and promote  achievement  of the purposes  of the  Plan,  and,  in
furtherance  of such  purposes  the  Committee  may make such  modifications,
amendments,  procedures,  subplans and the like as may be necessary  or  advisable  to
comply with  provisions  of laws in other  countries in which the Company operates or has
employees.

9.

Registration,
Listing and  Qualification  of Shares.

Each Option shall be subject to the requirement
that if at any time the Committee shall determine that the  registration,  listing or
qualification  of the shares  covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any
foreign,  federal,  state or local law, or the consent or  approval of any  governmental
regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with,  the
granting  of such Option or the  purchase of shares  thereunder,  no such Option may be
exercised  unless and  until such registration,  listing, qualification,  consent or
approval shall have been effected or obtained free of  any condition not  acceptable to
the  Committee.  Any person  exercising an Option shall make such  representations  and
agreements and furnish such  information as the Committee may request to assure
compliance  with the foregoing  or any other applicable legal requirements.

10.

Buy
Out of Option  Gains.

At any time  after any Stock  Option  becomes  exercisable,  the
Committee  shall have the right to elect,  in its sole  discretion  and without the
consent of the holder  thereof,  to cancel  such Option and to cause YUM to pay to the
Optionee  the excess of the Fair Market  Value of the shares of Common  Stock  covered by
such Option over the Option  Exercise  Price of such  Option at the date the  Committee
provides  written  notice  (the “Buy Out  Notice”)  of its  intention  to
exercise  such  right.  Buy outs  pursuant to this  provision  shall be effected by YUM
as  promptly  as possible  after the date of the Buy Out Notice.  Payments of  buy out
amounts may be made in cash,  in shares of Common Stock,  or partly in cash and partly in
Common Stock,  as  the  Committee  deems  advisable.  To the extent  payment is made in
shares of Common  Stock,  the number of shares  shall be  determined  by  dividing  the
amount of the  payment to be made by the Fair  Market  Value of a share of  Common Stock
at the date of the Buy Out Notice.  In no event shall YUM be required to deliver a
fractional  share  of Common  Stock in  satisfaction  of this buy out  provision.
Payments of any such buy out amounts  shall be made  net of any applicable foreign,
federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes.

11.

Adjustment
for  Change  in Stock  Subject  to Plan.

In the event of any  change  in the
outstanding  shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock  split,  stock  dividend,
recapitalization,  merger,  consolidation,  combination or exchange of shares or other
similar  corporate  change,  such equitable  adjustments  may be made in  the Plan and
the Options granted  hereunder as the Committee  determines are necessary or
appropriate,  including,  if  necessary,  an adjustment in the number of shares and
Option  Exercise  Prices per share  applicable to Options  then  outstanding  and in the
number of shares which are reserved for issuance under the Plan. Any such  adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.

12.

No
Rights to Options or  Employment.

No employee or other  person shall have any claim or
right to be  granted an Option  under the Plan.  Having  received an Option  under the
Plan shall not give an employee any right  to receive  any other grant under the Plan.
An Optionee  shall have no rights to or interest in any Option  except  as set forth
herein.  Neither the Plan nor any action  taken  hereunder  shall be construed as giving
any employee  any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.


13.

Rights
as  Shareholder.

An Optionee  under the Plan shall have no rights as a holder of Common
Stock  with respect to Options granted  hereunder,  unless and until certificates for
shares of Common Stock are issued to  such Optionee.

14.

Other
Actions.

This Plan shall not restrict the  authority of the  Committee or of YUM,  for
proper  corporate  purposes,  to grant or assume  stock  options,  other  than  under the
Plan,  to or with  respect to any  employee or other person.

15.

Costs
and  Expenses.

Except as provided in Sections 6 and 10 hereof with respect to taxes,
the costs  and  expenses  of  administering  the Plan shall be borne by YUM  and shall
not be charged to any grant nor to any  employee receiving a grant.

16.

Plan
Unfunded.

The Plan shall be unfunded.  Except for  reserving a sufficient  number of
authorized  shares  to the  extent  required  by law to meet the  requirements  of the
Plan,  YUM  shall  not be  required  to  establish  any  special or  separate  fund or
to make any other  segregation  of assets to assure the  delivery  of  YUM Common
Stock upon exercise of any Option granted under the Plan.

17.

Governing
Law.

This Plan shall be  governed  by and  construed  in  accordance  with the laws of
the  State of North Carolina.

18.

Effectiveness
and  Duration  of the Plan.

This Plan  shall  become  effective  at the  beginning  of
October 7, 1997.
