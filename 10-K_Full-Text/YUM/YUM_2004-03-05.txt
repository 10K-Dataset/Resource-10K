PART I

Item 1.     Business.

YUM! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM” or the “Company”),  formerly known as
TRICON Global Restaurants,  Inc., was  incorporated  under the laws of the state of North
Carolina in 1997. The principal  executive  offices of YUM are located at 1441  Gardiner
 Lane,  Louisville,  Kentucky  40213,  and its  telephone  number at that  location is
(502) 874-8300.

YUM, the registrant,  together with its restaurant operating companies and other
subsidiaries,  is referred to in this Form 10-K annual  report  (“Form  10-K”) as the
 Company.  Prior to October 6, 1997,  the  business of the Company was conducted by
PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”) through various subsidiaries and divisions.

This Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statements on page
40.

(a)

General
Development of Business

In January  1997,  PepsiCo  announced  its  decision to spin-off  its  restaurant
 businesses  to  shareholders  as an independent  public  company  (the  “Spin-off”).
 Effective  October  6,  1997,  PepsiCo  disposed  of its  restaurant businesses by
distributing  all of the  outstanding  shares of common stock of YUM to its
 shareholders.  YUM’s Common Stock  began  trading on the New York Stock  Exchange on
October 7, 1997 under the symbol  “YUM.”  Prior to that date, from  September 17, 1997
through  October 6, 1997,  YUM’s Common Stock was traded on the New York Stock  Exchange
on a “when-issued” basis.

On May 7, 2002, YUM completed the acquisition of Yorkshire Global  Restaurants,  Inc. (“YGR”),
 the parent company and operator of Long John  Silver’s  (“LJS”) and A&W  All-American
 Food  Restaurants  (“A&W”).  Additionally,  on May 16, 2002,  following receipt of
shareholder  approval,  the Company changed its name from TRICON Global Restaurants,
 Inc. to YUM! Brands, Inc.

Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used
interchangeably.

Financial
Information about Operating Segments

YUM  consists of five  operating  segments:  KFC,  Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell,  LJS/A&W and
YUM  Restaurants  International (“YRI” or  “International”).  For financial reporting
purposes,  management considers the four U.S. operating segments to be similar and,
 therefore,  has aggregated them into a single  reportable  operating  segment.
 Operating  segment information  for the years  ended  December  27,  2003,  December
 28, 2002 and  December  29, 2001 for the Company is included in  Management’s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations  (“MD&A”) in
Part II, Item 7, pages 17 through 40 and in the related  Consolidated  Financial
 Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 41 through 81.

Narrative
Description of Business

General

YUM is the world’s  largest  quick service  restaurant  (“QSR”)  company  based on
number of system  units,  with over 33,000 units in more than 100 countries and
 territories.  The YUM  organization is currently made up of six operating companies
 organized around the five restaurant  concepts of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS and A&W (the
 “Concepts”). The six operating companies are KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS, A&W and YRI.

Restaurant Concepts

Through its five Concepts, the Company develops,  operates,  franchises and licenses a
worldwide system of restaurants which prepare,  package and sell a menu of  competitively
 priced food items.  These  restaurants  are operated by the


Company or,  under the terms
of franchise or license  agreements,  by  franchisees  or licensees  who are  independent
third parties, or by affiliates in which we own a non-controlling equity interest (“Unconsolidated
Affiliates”).

In each  Concept,  consumers  can dine in and/or  carry out food.  In  addition,  Taco
Bell,  KFC, LJS and A&W offer a drive-thru option in many stores.  Pizza Hut offers a
drive-thru  option on a much more limited basis.  Pizza Hut and, on a much more limited
basis, KFC offer delivery service.

Each Concept has proprietary  menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with
high quality  ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices.

The franchise  program of the Company is designed to assure  consistency and quality,
 and the Company is selective in granting  franchises.  Under the standard  franchise
 agreement,  franchisees  supply  capital - initially by paying a franchise  fee to YUM,
 purchasing  or leasing the land,  building  and  equipment  and  purchasing,  signs,
 seating, inventories  and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the
business.  Franchisees  then  contribute to the Company’s revenues through the payment of
royalties based on a percentage of sales.

The Company  believes that it is important to maintain  strong and open  relationships
 with its franchisees and their representatives.  To this  end,  the  Company  invests  a
 significant  amount  of time  working  with the  franchisee community and their
 representative  organizations on all aspects of the business,  including new products,
 equipment and management techniques.

The Company is actively  pursuing the strategy of  multibranding,  where two or more
of its Concepts are operated in a single  unit.  In  addition,  the  Company  is testing
 multibranding  options  involving  one of its  Concepts  and a restaurant  concept not
owned by or affiliated  with YUM. By combining two or more restaurant  concepts,
 particularly those that have  complementary  daypart  strengths in one location,  the
Company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units,  significantly
 improve returns on per unit investment,  and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater
 number of trade  areas  throughout  the U.S.  and  internationally.  Through  the
 consolidation  of market planning  initiatives  across all of its Concepts,  the Company
has established,  or is in the process of establishing in the case of LJS and A&W,  multi-year
 development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company penetration of its
Concepts and to improve  returns on its existing  asset base.  The  development  of
 multibranded  units may be limited, in some instances, by prior development and/or
territory rights granted to franchisees.

At year-end 2003, there were 2,345  multibranded  units in the worldwide  system.
 These units were comprised of 2,282 units  offering food products  from two of the
Concepts (a “2n1”),  51 units  offering food products from three of the Concepts (a “3n1”)
and 12 units  offering  food  products  from one of the Concepts and either Pasta Bravo,
 a concept currently in development by the Company, or a restaurant concept not owned by
or affiliated with YUM.

Restaurant Operations

Through its Concepts,  YUM develops,  operates,  franchises and licenses a worldwide
 system of both  traditional  and non-traditional  QSR restaurants.  Traditional units
feature dine-in,  carryout and, in some instances,  drive-thru or delivery  services.
 Non-traditional  units,  which are typically  licensed outlets,  include express units
and kiosks which have a more  limited  menu and operate in  non-traditional  locations
 like malls,  airports,  gasoline  service stations,  convenience stores,  stadiums,
 amusement parks and colleges,  where a full-scale  traditional outlet would not be
practical or efficient.

The Company’s  restaurant  management  structure varies by concept and unit size.
 Generally,  each Company restaurant is led by a restaurant  general  manager  (“RGM”),
 together  with one or more  assistant  managers,  depending on the operating  complexity
and sales volume of the restaurant.  In the U.S., the average restaurant has 25 to 30
employees, while  Internationally  this figure can be  significantly  higher  depending
 on the  location and sales volume of the restaurant.  Most of the  employees  work on a
part-time  basis.  The Company’s  six  operating  companies  each issue detailed  manuals
 covering  all  aspects  of  their  respective  operations,  including  food  handling
 and  product preparation procedures,  safety and quality issues,  equipment maintenance,
 facility standards and accounting control procedures.  The  restaurant


management
 teams are  responsible  for the  day-to-day  operation  of each unit and for ensuring
 compliance  with  operating  standards.  CHAMPS  - which  stands  for  Cleanliness,
 Hospitality,  Accuracy, Maintenance,  Product  Quality and Speed of Service - is our
core  systemwide  program  for  training,  measuring  and rewarding  employee
 performance  against key customer measures.  CHAMPS is intended to align the operating
 processes of our  entire  system  around one set of  standards.  RGMs’  efforts,
 including  CHAMPS  performance  measures,  are monitored  by Area  Managers  or Market
 Coaches.  Market  Coaches  typically  work with  approximately  six to twelve
restaurants.  The  Company’s  restaurants  are visited  from time to time by various
 senior  operators to help ensure adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant
team members.

RGMs attend and complete their respective  operating  company’s required training
programs.  These programs consist of initial training, as well as additional  continuing
 development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time.
 Initial  manager  training  programs  generally last at least six weeks and emphasize
 leadership, business  management,  supervisory skills (including  training,  coaching,
 and recruiting),  product  preparation and production, safety, quality control, customer
service, labor management, and equipment maintenance.

Following is a brief description of each operating company:

KFC

KFC was founded in Corbin,  Kentucky by Colonel  Harland D. Sanders,  an early developer of the quick service
     food business and a pioneer of the restaurant  franchise  concept.  The Colonel  perfected his secret blend of 11
     herbs and spices for Kentucky  Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first  franchisee in 1952. KFC is based in
     Louisville, Kentucky.

As of year-end 2003, KFC was the leader in the U.S.  chicken QSR segment among  companies  featuring  chicken
     as their  primary  product  offering,  with a 47 percent  market share in that segment which is nearly four times
     that of its closest national competitor.

KFC operates in 89  countries  and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2003,  KFC had 5,524
     units in the U.S.,  and 7,354  units  outside the U.S.  Approximately  23 percent of both the U.S.  and  non-U.S.
     units are operated by the Company.

While product  offerings vary  throughout  the worldwide  system,  traditional  KFC  restaurants  offer fried
     chicken-on-the-bone  products,  primarily marketed under the names Original Recipe and Extra Tasty Crispy.  Other
     principal  entree items include chicken  sandwiches  (including the Twister),  Colonel’s  Crispy Strips,  Popcorn
     Chicken and,  seasonally,  Chunky Chicken Pot Pies. KFC restaurants  also offer a variety of side items,  such as
     biscuits,  mashed potatoes and gravy,  coleslaw,  corn,  potato wedges (in the U.S.) and french fries (outside of
     the  U.S.),  as well as  desserts.  Restaurant  decor is  characterized  by the image of the  Colonel,  and KFC’s
     distinctive packaging includes the “Bucket” of chicken.

Pizza Hut

The first  Pizza  Hut  restaurant  was  opened  in 1958 in  Wichita,  Kansas,  and  within a year,  the first
     franchise unit was opened.  Today,  Pizza Hut is the largest  restaurant  chain in the world  specializing in the
     sale of ready-to-eat pizza products.  Pizza Hut is based in Dallas, Texas.

As of year-end 2003,  Pizza Hut was the leader in the U.S. pizza QSR segment,  with a 15 percent market share
     in that segment.

Pizza Hut operates in 87 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2003,  Pizza Hut
     had 7,523 units in the U.S., and 4,560 units outside of the U.S.  Approximately  24 percent of the U.S. units and
     22 percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.


Pizza Hut features a variety of pizzas,  which may include Pan Pizza, Thin 'n Crispy, Hand Tossed,  Sicilian,
     Stuffed  Crust,  Twisted  Crust,  The Big New Yorker,  The Insider,  The Chicago Dish and 4forALL.  Each of these
     pizzas is offered with a variety of different toppings.  In some restaurants,  Pizza Hut also offers breadsticks,
     pasta, salads and sandwiches.  The distinctive Pizza Hut image typically features a bright red roof.

Taco Bell

The first  Taco Bell  restaurant  was  opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey,  California,  and in 1964,  the
     first Taco Bell franchise was sold.  Taco Bell is based in Irvine, California.

As of year-end  2003,  Taco Bell was the leader in the U.S.  Mexican QSR  segment,  with a 65 percent  market
     share in that segment.

Taco Bell operates in 13 countries and  territories  throughout the world.  As of year-end  2003,  there were
     5,989 Taco Bell units in the U.S., and 249 units outside of the U.S.  Approximately  21 percent of the U.S. units
     and 22 percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products,  including various types of tacos, burritos,  gorditas,
     chalupas,  quesadillas,  salads, nachos and other related items.  Additionally,  proprietary entrée items include
     Grilled Stuft Burritos and Border Bowls.  Taco Bell units feature a distinctive bell logo on their signage.

LJS

The first LJS  restaurant  opened in 1969 and the first LJS  franchise  unit opened later the same year.  LJS
     is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

As of year-end  2003, LJS was the leader in the U.S.  seafood QSR segment,  with a 35 percent market share in
     that segment.

LJS operates in 4 countries and  territories  throughout  the world.  As of year-end  2003,  there were 1,204
     LJS units in the U.S., and 31 units outside the U.S.  Approximately  58 percent of the U.S. units are operated by
     the Company.  All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees or licensees.

LJS features a variety of seafood items,  including meals featuring  batter-dipped fish, chicken,  shrimp and
     hushpuppies.  LJS units typically feature a distinctive seaside/nautical theme.

A&W

A&W was founded in Lodi,  California  by Roy Allen in 1919 and the first A&W  franchise  unit opened in 1925.
     A&W is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

A&W operates in 14 countries and territories  throughout the world.  As of year-end 2003,  there were 576 A&W
      units in the U.S.,  and 183 units outside the U.S.  Approximately  14 percent of the U.S.  units are operated by
      the Company.  All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees or licensees.

A&W  serves  A&W draft Root Beer and a  signature  A&W Root Beer  float,  as well as  all-American  pure-beef
     hamburgers and hot dogs.


International

The  international  operations of the five Concepts are consolidated into a separate
 operating  company (YRI),  which has directed its focus toward  franchise system growth
and  concentration  of Company  development in those markets in which the Company
 believes  sufficient  scale is achievable.  YRI has developed  global systems and tools
designed to improve marketing,  operations  consistency,  product delivery,  market
planning and development and franchise support capability.  YRI is based in Dallas, Texas.

As of year-end 2003,  YRI had 12,377 units.  Approximately  22 percent of these units
are operated by the Company.  In 2003, YRI accounted for 33 percent of the Company’s
revenues.

Operating Structure

In all five of its Concepts,  the Company either  operates  units or they are operated
by  independent  franchisees or licensees.  Franchisees  can  range  in size  from
 individuals  owning  just a few  units to  large  publicly  traded companies.  In
addition, the Company owns non-controlling  interests in Unconsolidated  Affiliates who
operate similar to  franchisees.  As of  year-end  2003,  approximately  24 percent of YUM’s
 worldwide  units  were  operated  by the Company,  approximately  65 percent by
franchisees,  approximately 7 percent by licensees and  approximately 4 percent by
Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Supply and Distribution

The  Company  is a  substantial  purchaser  of a number of food and paper  products,
 equipment  and other  restaurant supplies.  The  principal  items  purchased  include
 chicken  products,  cheese,  beef and pork  products,  paper and packaging materials,
 flour, produce,  certain beverages,  seafood,  cooking oils, pinto beans,  seasonings
and tomato products.

The Company,  along with the  representatives  of the  Company’s  KFC,  Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell,  LJS and A&W  franchisee groups, are members in the Unified  FoodService
 Purchasing Co-op, LLC (the “Unified Co-op”) which was created for the purpose of
 purchasing  certain  restaurant  products and  equipment in the U.S. The core mission of
the Unified Co-op is to provide the lowest  possible  sustainable  store-delivered
 prices for restaurant  products and equipment.  This arrangement  combines the
 purchasing  power of the Company and  franchisee  restaurants in the U.S. which the
Company believes  will  further  leverage  the  system’s  scale to drive cost  savings
 and  effectiveness  in the  purchasing function.  The Company also believes that the
Unified Co-op has  resulted,  and should  continue to result,  in closer alignment of
interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community.

The Company is  committed  to  conducting  its  business in an ethical,  legal and
 socially  responsible  manner.  To encourage  compliance with all legal requirements and
ethical business  practices,  YUM has a supplier code of conduct for all U.S.  suppliers
to our  business.  To ensure the  wholesomeness  of food  products,  suppliers are
required to meet or exceed strict quality control standards.  Long-term  contracts and
long-term vendor  relationships are used to ensure  availability of products.  The
Company has not experienced any significant  continuous  shortages of supplies, and
 alternative  sources for most of these  products  are  generally  available.  Prices
paid for these  supplies are subject to  fluctuation.  When prices  increase,  the
Company may be able to pass on such  increases to its customers, although there is no
assurance this can be done in the future.

Most food products,  paper and packaging  supplies,  and equipment used in the
operation of the Company’s  restaurants are  distributed  to individual  restaurant
 units by third party  distribution  companies.  Since  November 30, 2000, McLane
Company,  Inc.  (“McLane”) has been the exclusive  distributor for  Company-operated
 KFCs, Pizza Huts and Taco Bells in the U.S. and for a  substantial  number of franchisee
 and licensee  stores.  McLane  became the  distributor when it assumed all supply and
 distribution  responsibilities  under an existing  agreement  between  AmeriServe Food
Distribution,  Inc.  (“AmeriServe”)  and the Company  (the  “AmeriServe  Agreement”).
 McLane  assumed the  AmeriServe Agreement,  as amended,  as well as distribution
 agreements  covering a substantial portion of the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchise


system,  and, to a lesser extent, the KFC franchise system  simultaneously  with its
acquisition of the AmeriServe  business.  The AmeriServe  business was acquired by McLane
after  AmeriServe  filed for  protection  under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code
and a plan of  reorganization  for AmeriServe (the “POR”) was approved by the U.S.
 Bankruptcy  Court on November 28, 2000. A discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe
 bankruptcy  reorganization process on the Company is contained in Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 57.

In connection  with McLane’s  acquisition  and assumption of the AmeriServe
 Agreement,  the Company agreed to certain amendments,  including an extension  of the
 AmeriServe  Agreement  through  October 31, 2010.  Under the terms of the Agreement with
McLane,  Company-operated  KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  restaurants in the U.S.
 generally  cannot use alternative  distributors.  The Company  stores  within the LJS
system are  covered  under a separate  agreement  with McLane. A&W units are not
currently serviced by McLane.

YRI and its  franchisees  use  decentralized  sourcing and  distribution  systems
 involving  many  different  global, regional,  and local suppliers and distributors.  In
certain countries,  including China, YRI owns all or a portion of the distribution system.

Trademarks and Patents

The Company and its Concepts own numerous  registered  trademarks and service marks.
The Company believes that many of these marks,  including its Kentucky Fried Chicken®,
 KFC®, Pizza Hut®, Taco Bell® and Long John Silver’s® marks, have significant  value and
are materially  important to its business.  The Company’s  policy is to pursue
 registration of its important  marks  whenever  feasible and to oppose  vigorously  any
 infringement  of its marks.  The Company also licenses  certain  trademarks and service
marks,  including  certain of the A&W trademarks and service marks (the “A&W Marks”),
 which are owned by A&W Concentrate Company (formerly A&W Brands,  Inc.). A&W Concentrate
 Company,  which is not  affiliated  with the Company,  has granted the Company an
exclusive,  worldwide  (excluding  Canada),  perpetual, royalty-free license (with right
to sublicense) to use the A&W Marks for restaurant services.

The use of these marks by  franchisees  and licensees has been  authorized in KFC,
 Pizza Hut, Taco Bell,  LJS and A&W franchise  and license  agreements.  Under  current
law and with proper  use,  the  Company’s  rights in its marks can generally last
 indefinitely.  The Company also has certain  patents on restaurant  equipment  which,
 while valuable, are not material to its business.

Working Capital

Information  about the Company’s  working  capital is included in MD&A in Part II,
Item 7, pages 17 through 40 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II,
Item 8, page 43.

Customers

The Company’s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of
customers.

Seasonal Operations

The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.

Backlog Orders

Company restaurants have no backlog orders.


Government Contracts

No material  portion of the Company’s  business is subject to  renegotiation of
profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S.
government.

Competition

The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets,
 supercenters,  warehouse stores, convenience  stores,  coffee shops,  snack bars,
 delicatessens  and restaurants  (including the QSR segment),  and is intensely
competitive with respect to food quality,  price, service,  convenience,  location and
concept. The industry is often  affected  by  changes  in  consumer  tastes;  national,
 regional  or local  economic  conditions;  currency fluctuations;  demographic  trends;
 traffic  patterns;  the type, number and location of competing food retailers and
products;  and disposable  purchasing  power. Each of the Concepts compete with
 international,  national and regional restaurant  chains as well as locally-owned
 restaurants,  not only for customers,  but also for management and hourly personnel,
 suitable  real estate  sites and  qualified  franchisees.  In 2003 the  restaurant
 business in the United States consisted of about 870,000  restaurants  representing
 approximately $420 billion in annual sales. Our Concepts accounted  for about 2% of
those  restaurants  and about 4% of those sales.  There is  currently no way to
 reasonably estimate the size of the competitive market outside the U.S.

Research and Development (“R&D”)

The Company  operates R&D facilities in Louisville,  Kentucky;  Dallas,  Texas;  and
Irvine,  California.  The Company expensed  $26  million  in 2003  and $23  million  in
both  2002  and  2001  for R&D  activities.  From  time to time, independent  suppliers
 also  conduct  research  and  development  activities  for the benefit of the YUM
 system.  No amounts were spent on customer-sponsored research activities during 2003,
2002 or 2001.

Environmental Matters

The  Company is not aware of any  federal,  state or local  environmental  laws or
 regulations  that will  materially affect its  earnings  or  competitive  position,  or
result in material  capital  expenditures.  However,  the Company cannot predict the
effect on its  operations of possible  future  environmental  legislation  or
 regulations.  During 2003,  there  were no  material  capital  expenditures  for
 environmental  control  facilities  and no such  material expenditures are anticipated.

Government Regulation

U.S.

The Company is subject to various  federal,  state and local laws  affecting its
business.  Each of the Company’s restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by
a number of governmental  authorities,  which include health, sanitation,  safety and
fire agencies in the state or  municipality  in which the restaurant is located.  In
addition, each of the YUM  operating  companies  must comply with various  state laws
that  regulate  the  franchisor/franchisee relationship.  To date,  the  Company  has not
been  significantly  affected  by any  difficulty,  delay or failure to obtain required
licenses or approvals.

A small  portion  of Pizza  Hut’s and LJS’s net sales  are  attributable  to the sale
of beer and wine.  A license  is required in most cases for each site that sells
 alcoholic  beverages (in most cases, on an annual basis) and licenses may be revoked or
suspended for cause at any time.  Regulations  governing the sale of alcoholic  beverages
 relate to many  aspects of  restaurant  operations,  including  the minimum age of
patrons and  employees,  hours of  operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing,
inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

The  Company is also  subject to federal  and state laws  governing  such  matters as
 employment  and pay  practices, overtime,  tip credits and working  conditions.  The
bulk of the  Company’s  employees  are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the
federal and state minimum wages.


The Company is also  subject to federal and state child labor laws  which,  among
other  things,  prohibit  the use of certain  “hazardous  equipment” by employees 18
years of age or younger.  The Company has not to date been  materially adversely affected
by such laws.

The Company  continues to monitor its facilities for compliance  with the Americans
with  Disabilities  Act (“ADA”) in order to conform to its  requirements.  Under the ADA,
 the Company  could be  required to expend  funds to modify its restaurants to better
provide service to, or make  reasonable  accommodation  for the employment of disabled
 persons. We believe that expenditures, if required, would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s operations.

International.

Internationally,  the  Company’s  restaurants  are subject to national
and local laws and  regulations which are similar to those  affecting  the Company’s
 U.S.  restaurants,  including  laws and  regulations  concerning labor,  health,
 sanitation and safety.  The international  restaurants are also subject to tariffs and
regulations on imported   commodities  and  equipment  and  laws  regulating  foreign
 investment.   International   compliance  with environmental  requirements  has not had
a material  adverse effect on the Company’s  results of  operations,  capital
expenditures or competitive position.

Employees

As of year-end  2003,  the Company  employed  approximately  265,000  persons,
 approximately  73 percent of whom were part-time  employees.  Approximately  52 percent
of the  Company’s  employees  are  employed  in the U.S.  The Company believes that it
provides  working  conditions  and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of
its principal competitors.  Most Company  employees  are paid on an hourly  basis.  Some
of the  Company’s  non-U.S.  employees  are subject to labor  council  relationships
 that vary due to the diverse  cultures in which the  Company  operates.  The Company
considers its employee relations to be good.

Item 2.     Properties.

As of year-end  2003,  YUM Concepts owned over 1,600 units and leased over 3,400 units
in the U.S.; and YRI owned over 300 units and leased  over 2,400  units  outside  the
U.S.  Company  restaurants  in the U.S.  which are not owned are generally  leased  for
 initial  terms of 15 or 20 years  and  generally  have  renewal  options;  however,
 Pizza Hut delivery/carryout  units in the U.S.  generally are leased for significantly
 shorter initial terms with short renewal options.  The Company  generally does not lease
or sub-lease  units that it owns or leases to  franchisees.  Pizza Hut leases  its and YRI’s
 corporate  headquarters  and a  research  facility  in  Dallas,  Texas.  Taco Bell
 leases  its corporate  headquarters  and  research  facility  in  Irvine,  California.
 KFC owns its and  LJS’s,  A&W’s  and YUM’s corporate  headquarters and a research
 facility in Louisville,  Kentucky.  In addition,  YUM leases office facilities for
certain  support  groups in  Louisville,  Kentucky.  The former LJS and A&W  corporate
 headquarters  and research facility in Lexington,  Kentucky  continues to be under
lease,  though  efforts to transition  the property out of the YUM system are  ongoing.
 Additional


information  about the  Company’s  properties  is included  in the
 Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 41 through 81.

The Company  believes that its properties are generally in good operating  condition
and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings.

The Company is subject to various claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,
 taxes,  real estate,  environmental and other  matters  arising in the  normal  course
of  business.  The  following  is a brief  description  of the more significant  of these
 categories of lawsuits and other  matters.  Except as stated below,  the Company
 believes that the  ultimate  liability,  if any,  in excess of  amounts  already
 provided  for these  matters  in the  Consolidated Financial  Statements,  is not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s annual results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows.

Franchising

A substantial  number of the  restaurants of each of the Concepts are franchised to
independent  businesses  operating under  arrangements  with the  Concepts.  In the
 course of the  franchise  relationship,  occasional  disputes  arise between  the
Company  and its  franchisees  relating to a broad  range of  subjects,  including,
 without  limitation, quality,  service,  and cleanliness  issues,  contentions
 regarding grants,  transfers or terminations of franchises, territorial disputes and
delinquent payments.

Suppliers

The Company,  through approved  distributors,  purchases food,  paper,  equipment and
other  restaurant  supplies from numerous  independent  suppliers  throughout the world.
 These suppliers are required to meet and maintain  compliance with the Company’s
 standards and  specifications.  On occasion,  disputes arise between the Company and its
suppliers on a  number  of  issues,  including,  but not  limited  to,  compliance  with
 product  specifications  and  terms of procurement and service requirements.

Employees

At any given time, the Company employs hundreds of thousands of persons,  primarily in
its  restaurants.  In addition, each year  thousands of persons seek  employment  with
the Company and its  restaurants.  From time to time,  disputes arise regarding employee
hiring, compensation, termination and promotion practices.

Like other retail  employers,  the Company has been faced in a few states with
 allegations  of  purported  class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 29,  1997,  a class  action  lawsuit  against  Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Bravo,  et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Bravo”),  was filed in the Circuit  Court of the
State of Oregon of the County of  Multnomah.  The lawsuit was filed by two former Taco
Bell shift  managers  purporting  to  represent  approximately  17,000  current  and
former  hourly employees statewide.  The lawsuit alleged violations of state wage and
hour laws,  principally  involving unpaid wages including  overtime,  and rest and meal
period violations,  and sought an unspecified amount in damages.  Under Oregon class
 action  procedures,  Taco Bell was allowed an  opportunity  to “cure” the unpaid wage
and hour  allegations  by opening a claims  process to all putative  class members prior
to  certification  of the class.  In this cure process, Taco Bell paid out less than $1
million.  On January 26, 1999,  the Court  certified a class of all current and former
shift managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged  violations.  A
 Court-approved  notice and claim form was mailed to  approximately  14,500  class
 members on January  31,  2000.  Trial  began on January 4, 2001.  On March 9, 2001, the
jury reached  verdicts on the  substantive  issues in this matter.  A number of these
verdicts were in favor of the Taco Bell position;  however,  certain issues were decided
in favor of the plaintiffs.  In April 2002, a jury trial to  determine  the damages of 93
of those  claimants  found that Taco Bell failed to pay for certain meal breaks and/or
 off-the-clock work for 86 of the 93 claimants.


However,  the total amount of hours
awarded by the jury was  substantially  less than that sought by the  claimants.  In July
and September  2002,  the court ruled on several post-trial  motions,  including  fixing
the total number of potential  claimants at 1,031  (including the 93 claimants for which
damages had already been  determined)  and holding that  claimants  who prevail are
entitled to  prejudgment interest and penalty  wages.  The second damages trial for the
remaining 938 claimants  began on July 7, 2003.  Before the trial  concluded,  the
 parties  reached an  agreement  to settle  this matter in full.  The court  granted
 final approval of the  settlement  on December 23, 2003 and final  judgment of
 dismissal  was entered on December 26, 2003. Payments  to class  counsel  and  eligible
 claimants  were  made in the first  quarter  of 2004.  We have  previously provided for
the costs of this settlement as  AmeriServe and other charges (credits).

Customers

The Company’s  restaurants serve a large and diverse  cross-section of the public and
in the course of serving so many people,  disputes arise regarding products,  service,
 accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of the
Company.

Intellectual Property

The Company has registered  trademarks and service  marks,  many of which are of
material  importance to the Company’s business.  From time to time,  the Company  may
become  involved  in  litigation  to defend and protect its use of its registered marks.

Other Litigation

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Wrench LLC,
Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

was filed in the United States
 District Court for the Western  District of Michigan.  The lawsuit  alleged that Taco
Bell Corp.  misappropriated  certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising
 featuring a Chihuahua.  The plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several
theories,  including breach of  implied-in-fact  contract, idea  misappropriation,
 conversion  and unfair  competition.  On June 10, 1999,  the District  Court granted
 summary judgment  in favor of Taco  Bell  Corp.  Plaintiffs  filed an  appeal  with the
U.S.  Court of  Appeals  for the Sixth Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”),  and oral
 arguments  were held on September 20, 2000. On July 6, 2001, the Court of Appeals
 reversed  the  District  Court’s  judgment in favor of Taco Bell Corp.  and remanded the
case to the District Court.  Taco Bell Corp.  unsuccessfully  petitioned  the Court of
Appeals for rehearing en banc,  and its petition for writ of  certiorari  to the United
 States  Supreme  Court was denied on January 21,  2002.  The case was  returned to
District  Court  for trial  which  began on May 14,  2003 and on June 4,  2003 the jury
 awarded  $30  million  to the plaintiffs.  Subsequently,  the  plaintiffs’  moved to
 amend  the  judgment  to  include  pre-judgment  interest  and post-judgment  interest
and Taco Bell filed its post-trial  motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new
trial.  On September  9, 2003,  the  District  Court denied Taco Bell’s  motion and
granted the  plaintiff’s  motion to amend the judgment.

In view of the jury verdict and  subsequent  District  Court  ruling,  we recorded a
charge of $42 million in 2003. We continue to believe that the Wrench  plaintiffs’  claims
are without  merit and have appealed the verdict to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
 Post-judgment interest will continue to accrue during the appeal process.

On July 9, 2003 we filed suit against Taco Bell’s former  advertising  agency in the
United States  District Court for the Central District of California  seeking
 reimbursement for any final award that may be ultimately  affirmed by the appeals courts
and costs that we have incurred in defending this matter.  We are also seeking
 reimbursement  from our insurance carriers.

Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction and Overview

YUM!  Brands,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  (collectively  referred to as “YUM” or the  “Company”)
 comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silver’s  (“LJS”)
and A&W  All-American  Food  Restaurants  (“A&W”)(collectively  “the  Concepts”)  and is
the world’s  largest quick  service  restaurant  (“QSR”)  company based on the number of
system units.  LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired  Yorkshire Global  Restaurants,
 Inc. (“YGR”) on May 7, 2002.  With 12,377  international  units,  YUM is  the second
 largest QSR company  outside the U.S.  YUM became an independent,  publicly-owned company on  October 6, 1997 (the  “Spin-off  Date”) via a tax-free  distribution  of our
Common Stock (the “Distribution” or “Spin-off”) to the shareholders of our former parent,
PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”).

Through  its  Concepts,  YUM  develops,   operates,   franchises  and  licenses  a
 system  of  both  traditional  and non-traditional  QSR restaurants.  Traditional units
feature dine-in,  carryout and, in some instances,  drive-thru or delivery  services.
 Non-traditional  units,  which are typically  licensed outlets,  include express units
and kiosks which have a more  limited  menu and operate in  non-traditional  locations
 like malls,  airports,  gasoline  service stations,  convenience stores,  stadiums,
 amusement parks and colleges,  where a full-scale  traditional outlet would not be
practical or efficient.

The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets,
 supercenters,  warehouse stores, convenience  stores,  coffee shops,  snack bars,
 delicatessens  and restaurants  (including the QSR segment),  and is intensely
competitive with respect to food quality,  price, service,  convenience,  location and
concept. The industry is often  affected  by  changes  in  consumer  tastes;  national,
 regional  or local  economic  conditions;  currency fluctuations;  demographic  trends;
 traffic  patterns;  the type, number and location of competing food retailers and
products;  and disposable  purchasing  power. Each of the Concepts compete with
 international,  national and regional restaurant  chains as well as locally-owned
 restaurants,  not only for customers,  but also for management and hourly personnel,
suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.

The Company is focused on five  long-term  measures  identified  as essential to our
growth and  progress.  These five measures and related key performance indicators are as
follows:

International expansion

International system-sales growth (local currency)

Number of new international restaurant openings

Net international unit growth

Multibrand innovation and expansion

Number of multibrand restaurant locations

Number of multibrand units added

Number of franchise multibrand units added

Portfolio of category-leading U.S. brands

U.S. blended same-store sales growth

U.S. system-sales growth

Global franchise fees

New restaurant openings by franchisees

Franchise fee growth


Strong cash generation and returns

Cash generated from all sources

Cash generated from all sources after capital spending

Restaurant margins

Our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the Management’s
Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

All  references  to per share and share amounts in the  following  MD&A have been

Factors Affecting Comparability of 2003 Results to 2002 Results and 2002 Results to
2001 Results

YGR Acquisition

On May 7, 2002,  the Company  completed its  acquisition  of YGR, the parent  company
of LJS and A&W. See Note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition.

As of the date of the  acquisition,  YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and
franchise LJS units,  respectively,  and 127 and 742 company and franchise A&W units,
 respectively.  In addition,  133 multibranded  LJS/A&W  restaurants were included in the
LJS unit totals.  Except as discussed in certain  sections of the MD&A, the impact of the
 acquisition on our results of operations in 2003 and 2002 was not significant relative
to the comparable prior year period.

Amendment of Sale-Leaseback Agreements

As discussed in Note 14, on August 15, 2003 we amended two  sale-leaseback  agreements
assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR such that the agreements  now qualify for
 sale-leaseback  accounting.  There was no gain or loss recorded as a result of this
 transaction;  however,  restaurant  margins  decreased by  approximately $3 million for
the year ended December 27, 2003 as a result of the two amended  agreements  being
 accounted for as operating  leases  subsequent to the amendment.  The decrease in
restaurant margin was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense.

Wrench Litigation

We recorded expense of $42 million in 2003.  See Note 24 for a discussion of the
Wrench litigation.

AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits)

We  recorded  income of $26  million in 2003,  $27  million in 2002 and $3 million in
2001.  See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits).

Store Portfolio Strategy

From time to time we sell Company  restaurants  to existing and new  franchisees
 where  geographic  synergies  can be obtained or where their  expertise  can  generally
be leveraged to improve our overall  operating  performance,  while retaining Company
ownership of key U.S. and International  markets.  Such  refranchisings  reduce our
reported Company sales and restaurant profits while increasing our franchise fees.
 Proceeds from  refranchising  increase the level of cash available to fund discretionary
spending.

 includes  charges of  approximately  $16 million to write down the  carrying  value of
our Puerto Rican business  to  reflect  the  then  current  estimates  of its
fair  value.  The  charges  were  recorded  as a          refranchising  loss.  2001
includes $12 million of previously  deferred  refranchising  gains and a charge of
         $11  million to mark to market the net assets of our  Singapore  business,
 which was sold  during  2002 at a          price approximately equal to its carrying
value.

In  addition  to our  refranchising  program,  from time to time we close  restaurants
 that are poor  performing,  we relocate  restaurants  to a new site within the same
trade area or we  consolidate  two or more of our existing  units into a single unit
(collectively “store closures”).

The impact on  operating  profit  arising  from our  refranchising  and Company  store
 closures is the net of (a) the estimated  reduction  in  restaurant  profit,   which
 reflects  the  decrease  in  Company  sales,  and  general  and administrative  expenses
and (b) the estimated  increase in franchise fees from the stores  refranchised.  The
amounts presented  below  reflect the  estimated  impact from stores that were  operated
by us for all or some  portion of the respective  previous year and were no longer
 operated by us as of the last day of the  respective  year.  The amounts do not include
 results from new  restaurants  that we open in connection with a relocation of an
existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing
units into a single unit.

Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

Effective  December 30, 2001,  the Company  adopted  Statement of  Financial
 Accounting  Standards  (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets” (“SFAS
142”), in its entirety.  In accordance  with the  requirements of SFAS 142, we ceased
 amortization  of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangibles  as of December 30, 2001.
 The  following table summarizes the favorable  effect of SFAS 142 on restaurant  profit,
 restaurant  margin and operating profit had SFAS 142 been effective in 2001.

Additionally, if SFAS 142 had been effective in 2001, reported net income would have
increased approximately $26 million and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) would
have increased $0.09.

SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles be evaluated for
impairment on an annual basis or as impairment indicators exist.  In accordance with this
requirement, we recognized impairment of approximately $5 million in both 2003 and 2002.

The  franchise  unit counts  include  both  franchisee  and  unconsolidated  affiliate
 multibrand  units.  Multibrand conversions  increase  the sales and points of
 distribution  for the second  brand added to a  restaurant  but do not result in an
additional unit count.  Similarly,  a new multibrand  restaurant,  while  increasing
 sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit
count.

For 2003 and  2002,  Company  multibrand  unit  gross  additions  were 235 and 216,
 respectively.  For 2003 and 2002, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 194 and

Worldwide System Sales Growth

System Sales Growth



Worldwide


%


%

System  sales  growth  includes the results of all  restaurants  regardless  of
 ownership,  including  company-owned, franchise,  unconsolidated  affiliate  and license
 restaurants.  Sales of  franchise,  unconsolidated  affiliate  and license  restaurants
 generate  franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of
sales). Franchise,  unconsolidated  affiliate  and  license  restaurants  sales  are not
 included  in  company  sales  on the Consolidated  Statements  of Income;  however,  the
fees are included in the  Company’s  revenues.  We believe  system sales  growth is
useful to  investors  as a  significant  indicator  of the  overall  strength  of our
 business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same store
sales as well as net unit development.

System sales  increased 7% for 2003,  after a 2% favorable  impact from foreign
 currency  translation.  Excluding the favorable  impact of both  foreign  currency
 translation  and the YGR  acquisition,  system sales  increased  3%. The increase was
driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures.

System sales increased 8% in 2002. The impact from foreign  currency  translation was
not  significant.  Excluding the favorable  impact of the YGR acquisition,  system sales
increased 5%. The increase  resulted from new unit development and same store sales
growth, partially offset by store closures.


Worldwide Revenues

Company sales increased $550 million or 8% in 2003,  after a 1% favorable  impact from
foreign  currency  translation. Excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency
 translation and the YGR acquisition,  Company sales increased 4%.  The increase was
driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and refranchising.

Franchise and license fees  increased  $73 million or 9% in 2003,  after a 3%
favorable  impact from foreign  currency translation.  Excluding the impact of foreign
 currency  translation and the favorable  impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise  and
license fees  increased  5%. The increase was driven by new unit  development,  royalty
rate  increases and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

Company  sales  increased  $753  million  or 12% in  2002.  The  impact  from  foreign
 currency  translation  was not significant.  Excluding  the favorable  impact of the YGR
 acquisition,  Company sales  increased 6%. The increase was driven by new unit
development and same store sales growth.  The increase was partially  offset by
 refranchising  and store closures.

Franchise  and license fees  increased $51 million or 6% in 2002.  The impact from
foreign  currency  translation  was not  significant.  Excluding the favorable  impact of
the YGR  acquisition,  franchise and license fees  increased 4%. The increase was driven
by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

The changes in U.S. and International restaurant margin for 2003 and 2002 are
discussed in the respective sections.

Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses

General and  administrative  expenses  increased  $32 million or 3% in 2003,
 including a 1%  unfavorable  impact from foreign currency  translation.  Excluding the
unfavorable  impact from both foreign  currency  translation and the YGR acquisition,
 general and  administrative  expenses were flat year to date.  Lower management
 incentive  compensation costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with
international restaurant expansion and pension expense.

General and  administrative  expenses  increased $117 million or 15% in 2002.
 Excluding the unfavorable impact of the YGR  acquisition,   general  and
  administrative   expenses   increased  10%.  The  increase  was  driven  by  higher
compensation-related costs and higher corporate and project spending.


Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses

Franchise and license  expenses  decreased  $21 million or 42% in 2003.  The decrease
was  primarily  attributable  to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee
receivables, primarily at Taco Bell.

Franchise and license  expenses  decreased  $10 million or 18% in 2002.  The decrease
was  primarily  attributable  to lower  allowances  for doubtful  franchise and license
fee  receivables  and the favorable  impact of lapping  support costs related to the
financial  restructuring  of certain Taco Bell  franchisees  in 2001.  The decrease was
partially offset by higher marketing support costs in certain international markets.

Interest expense  increased $8 million or 5% in 2002.  Excluding the impact of the YGR
 acquisition,  interest expense decreased  12%. The decrease  was driven by a reduction
 in our average debt balance  partially  offset by an increase in our  average  interest
 rate.  Our  average  interest  rate  increased  due  to a  reduction  in our
 variable-rate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term, fixed-rate

Income  taxes and the  effective  tax rate as shown  above  reflect  tax on all
 amounts  included  in our  results of operations  except for the  income  tax  benefit
of  approximately  $1  million  on the $2 million  cumulative  effect adjustment recorded
in the year ended December 27, 2003 due to the adoption of SFAS 143.

The 2003  effective tax rate  decreased  1.9  percentage  points to 30.2%.  The
decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily  due to a 4.1  percentage  point benefit
of amending  certain prior U.S.  income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes
paid in prior years.  The returns were amended upon our  determination  that it was more
 beneficial to claim  credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes,  as had been done
when the returns were  originally  filed. In future  years,  we  anticipate  continuing
 to claim credit for foreign  taxes paid in the then current year, as we have done in
2003 and 2002.  However, the amended return benefit recognized in 2003 is non-recurring.

The decrease in the 2003  effective tax rate was  partially  offset by the
 recognition  of valuation  allowances  for certain  deferred  tax  assets  whose
 realization  is no  longer  considered  more  likely  than not.  The  valuation
allowances  recognized  primarily related to deferred tax assets in Mexico and Thailand.
 See Note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances.


The 2002  effective tax rate  decreased  0.7  percentage  points to 32.1%.  The
decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to our claiming  credit against our
current and future U.S.  income tax liability for foreign taxes paid in 2002,  as opposed
to deducting  such taxes on our U.S.  income tax returns as was done in 2001.  This
 decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping valuation allowance reversals
recorded in 2001.

In 2003 and  2002,  the  effective  tax rate  attributable  to  foreign  operations
 was lower  than the U.S.  federal statutory  rate  primarily  due to the benefit of
 claiming  credit  against  our  current and future U.S.  income tax liability for
foreign taxes paid.

Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the  reconciliation  of income tax amounts  recorded in our
Consolidated  Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns,  including any adjustments to the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes  changes in tax reserves  established for potential
exposure we may incur if a taxing  authority  takes a position on a matter  contrary to our  position.  We evaluate  these
reserves,  including  interest  thereon,  on a quarterly  basis to insure that they have been  appropriately  adjusted for
events that we believe may impact our exposure.

Restaurant  margin as a  percentage  of sales  decreased  approximately  140 basis
 points in 2003.  The  decrease was primarily  driven by increased  occupancy  expenses
 due to higher  rent,  primarily  due to  additional  rent expense associated  with the
 amended  YGR  sale-leaseback  agreements,  and  utilities.  The higher food and paper
costs were primarily  due to the impact of  unfavorable  discounting  and product  mix.
 Also  contributing  to the  decrease was higher labor costs, primarily driven by low
single-digit increases in wage rates.

Restaurant  margin as a percentage of sales  increased  approximately  80 basis points
in 2002. The increase  includes the favorable  impact of  approximately  50 basis points
from the adoption of SFAS 142, which was partially  offset by the unfavorable  impact of
approximately  20 basis points from the YGR acquisition.  The increase was primarily
driven by the favorable  impact of same store sales growth on margin and lower food and
paper costs,  partially  offset by an increase in labor  costs.  The decrease in food and
paper costs was  primarily  driven by cheese  costs.  The increase in labor costs was
primarily driven by wage rates.

U.S. Operating Profit

Operating  profit  increased  $10  million  or 1% in 2003.  Excluding  the  favorable
 impact of the YGR  acquisition, operating  profit was flat  compared to 2002.  Decreases
 driven by lower  margins as a result of increased  occupancy expenses  and the impact of
 unfavorable  discounting  and  product  mix shift on food and paper  costs were offset
by lower franchise and license and general and administrative expenses.

Operating  profit  increased  $107 million or 15% in 2002,  including a 3% favorable
 impact from the adoption of SFAS 142.  Excluding the favorable  impact of both SFAS 142
and the YGR  acquisition,  operating  profit  increased 9%. The increase was driven by
same store sales growth and the  favorable  impact of lapping  franchise  support costs
related to the  restructuring  of  certain  Taco  Bell  franchisees  in 2001.  The
 increase  was  partially  offset by higher restaurant  operating  costs,  primarily due
to higher labor costs, and the unfavorable  impact of  refranchising  and store closures.
 The higher labor costs were driven by wage rates.

International System Sales Growth

System Sales Growth



International


%


%

System sales increased 14% in 2003, after a 7% favorable impact from foreign  currency
 translation.  The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store
closures.

System sales increased 8% in 2002,  after a 1% unfavorable  impact from foreign
 currency  translation.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency  translation and the
favorable  impact of the YGR  acquisition,  system sales increased 8%. The increase was
driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store
closures.

International Revenues

Company sales increased $247 million or 12% in 2003, after a 4% favorable  impact from
foreign  currency  translation. The increase was driven by new unit  development,
 partially  offset by  refranchising,  same store sales declines and store closures.

Franchise and license fees  increased $68 million or 23% in 2003,  after a 9%
favorable  impact from foreign  currency translation.  The increase was driven by new
unit  development,  royalty rate  increases  and same store sales growth, partially
offset by store closures.

Company sales increased $262 million or 14% in 2002, after a 1% favorable  impact from
foreign  currency  translation. The  increase  was  driven  by new unit  development,
 partially  offset by  refranchising  and  store  closures.  The unfavorable  impact of
refranchising  primarily  resulted from the sale of the Singapore business in the third
quarter of 2002.

Franchise and license fees increased $22 million or 8% in 2002,  after a 1%
unfavorable  impact from foreign  currency translation.  Excluding the impact of foreign
 currency  translation and the favorable  impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise  and
 license  fees  increased  8%. The  increase  was driven by new unit  development  and
same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

Restaurant  margin as a percentage  of sales  decreased  approximately  50 basis
points in 2003,  including a 20 basis points  unfavorable  impact from foreign  currency
 translation.  The  remaining  decrease was driven by the impact on margin of same store
sales  declines.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset by the impact of supply chain
savings initiatives  on the cost of food and paper  (principally  in China),  and the
 cessation  of  depreciation  expense of approximately $9 million for the Puerto Rico
business which is held for sale.

Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased  approximately 210 basis points
in 2002,  including the favorable impact of  approximately  60 basis points from the
adoption of SFAS 142.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven by the favorable impact of
lower  restaurant  operating costs and the elimination of lower average margin units
through store closures.  Lower restaurant  operating costs primarily  resulted from lower
food and paper costs,  partially offset by higher labor costs.

International Operating Profit

Operating  profit  increased  $80  million or 22% in 2003,  including a 7%  favorable
 impact  from  foreign  currency translation.  The  remaining  increase  was  driven by
new unit  development  and the impact of supply  chain  savings initiatives  on the cost
of food and paper,  partially  offset by the impact of same store  sales  declines on
margins and higher general and administrative expenses.

Operating  profit increased $56 million or 19% in 2002.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency  translation and the favorable  impact from the adoption of SFAS 142,
 operating  profit increased 13%. The increase was driven by new unit development and the
favorable  impact of lower  restaurant  operating  costs,  primarily lower cost of food
and paper. The increase was  partially  offset by higher  general and  administrative
 expenses,  primarily  compensation-related costs.

Consolidated Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating  activities

was $1,053  million  compared to $1,088
 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily driven by $130 million in voluntary
 contributions  to our funded pension plan in 2003,  partially offset by higher net
income.

In 2002,  net cash provided by operating  activities was $1,088  million  compared to
$832 million in 2001.  Excluding the impact of the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy
 reorganization  process,  cash provided by operating  activities was $1,043 million
 versus $704  million in 2001.  The  increase  was driven by higher net income and timing
of tax  receipts and payments.

Net cash used in  investing  activities

was $519 million  versus $885 million in
2002.  The decrease in cash used was driven by the $275 million acquisition of YGR in
2002 and lower capital spending in 2003.

In 2002,  net cash used in investing  activities  was $885 million  versus $503
million in 2001.  The increase in cash used was  primarily  due to the  acquisition  of
YGR and higher  capital  spending  in 2002,  partially  offset by the acquisition of
fewer restaurants from franchisees in 2002.

Net cash used in  financing  activities

was $475  million  versus $187  million in
2002.  The  increase was driven by higher net debt repayments and higher shares
repurchased in 2003.

In 2002,  net cash used in  financing  activities  was $187  million  versus  $352
 million in 2001.  The  decrease is primarily due to lower debt repayments and higher
proceeds from stock option exercises  versus 2001,  partially offset by higher shares
repurchased in 2002.

Consolidated Financial Condition

Assets

increased  $220  million  or 4% to $5.6  billion  primarily  due to a net
 increase  in  property,  plant  and equipment,  driven by capital  expenditures  in
excess of  depreciation  and asset  dispositions.  The decrease in the allowance  for


doubtful  accounts  from $42 million to $28  million  was  primarily  the result of the
 write-off  of receivables previously fully reserved.

Liabilities

decreased  $306 million or 6% to $4.5 billion  primarily due to the
repayment of amounts under our Credit Facility,  decreased  short-term  borrowings  and
the  reduction  in  long-term  debt as a result of the  amendment of certain
 sale-leaseback  agreements  (see Note 14). These  decreases were partially  offset by an
increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily due to the accrual
of $42 million related to the Wrench litigation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate  substantial  cash flows from the
operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations,  which require a
limited YUM investment.  In each of the last two fiscal years, net cash  provided  by
 operating  activities  has  exceeded  $1  billion.  These cash  flows have  allowed us
to fund our discretionary  spending,  while at the same time reducing our long-term debt
 balances.  We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating  activities to
continue in the foreseeable  future.  Our  discretionary  spending  includes capital
 spending for new  restaurants,  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and
repurchases of shares of our common stock.  Though a decline in revenues  could
 adversely  impact our cash flows from  operations,  we believe our operating cash flows,
our ability to reduce discretionary  spending,  and our borrowing capacity will allow us
to meet our cash requirements in 2004 and beyond.

Our primary bank credit  agreement  comprises a senior  unsecured  Revolving  Credit
Facility (the “Credit  Facility”) which  matures on June 25,  2005.  On December 26,
 2003,  we  voluntarily  reduced our maximum  borrowings  under the Credit  Facility from
$1.2 billion to $1.0 billion.  At December 27, 2003,  our unused  Credit  Facility
 totaled $737 million,  net of  outstanding  letters of credit of $263  million.  There
 were no  borrowings  outstanding  under the Credit  Facility at December 27, 2003. Our
Credit Facility  contains  financial  covenants  relating to maintenance of leverage and
fixed charge  coverage  ratios.  The Credit  Facility also contains  affirmative  and
negative  covenants including,  among other things, limitations on certain additional
indebtedness,  guarantees of indebtedness,  level of cash dividends,  aggregate non-U.S.
 investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement. We were in
compliance  with all covenants at December 27, 2003, and do not anticipate  that the
covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility for its remaining
term.

The remainder of our long-term debt primarily  comprises  senior  unsecured notes.
 Amounts  outstanding  under senior unsecured  notes were $1.85  billion at December 27,
2003.  The first of these notes,  in the amount of $350  million, matures in 2005. We
currently  anticipate  that our net cash provided by operating  activities  will permit
us to make a significant portion of this $350 million payment without borrowing
additional amounts.

We  estimate  that  capital  spending  will  be  approximately  $770  million  and
 refranchising   proceeds  will  be approximately  $100 million in 2004.  In November
 2003,  our Board of Directors  authorized a new $300 million  share repurchase  program.
 At December 27, 2003, we had remaining capacity to repurchase,  through May 21, 2005, up
to $294 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees)
under this program.


In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, significant
 contractual  obligations and payments as of December 27, 2003 included:

(b)

These
obligations,  which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately  5,900
restaurants.  See Note      15.

(c)

Purchase
 obligations  include  agreements  to purchase  goods or services that are  enforceable
 and legally      binding on us and that specify all significant  terms,  including:
 fixed or minimum  quantities to be purchased;      fixed,  minimum or variable price
 provisions;  and the approximate  timing of the transaction.  We have excluded
     agreements that are cancelable without penalty.  Purchase  obligations relate
primarily to purchases of property,      plant and equipment as well as marketing,
information technology, maintenance, consulting and other agreements.

We have not included  obligations under our pension and  postretirement  benefit plans
in the contractual  obligations table.  Our funding policy  regarding our funded pension
plan is to contribute  amounts  necessary to satisfy  minimum pension funding
 requirements  plus such  additional  amounts from time to time as are determined to be
appropriate to improve the plan’s funded  status.  The pension  plan’s funded status is
affected by many factors  including  discount rates and the performance of plan assets.
 We are not required to make minimum  pension funding  payments in 2004, but we may make
 discretionary  contributions  during the year based on our estimate of the plan’s
expected  September 30, 2004 funded status.  During 2003, we made voluntary  pension
 contributions  of $130 million to our funded plan,  none of which represented  minimum
funding  requirements.  Our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance,
but is pay as you go.  We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2003.

Also excluded from the  contractual  obligations  table are payments we may make for
employee  health and property and casualty  losses for which we are  self-insured.  The
majority of our recorded  liability  for  self-insured  employee health and property and
casualty losses  represents  estimated  reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be
filed or settled.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 27, 2003, we had provided  approximately  $32 million of partial
 guarantees of two franchisee loan pools, both of which were  implemented  prior to
 spin-off,  related  primarily  to the  Company’s  historical  refranchising programs
and, to a lesser  extent,  franchisee  development  of new  restaurants.  The total loans
 outstanding  under these loan pools were  approximately  $123  million at December  27,
 2003.  In support of these  guarantees,  we have posted $32 million of letters of
credit.  We also  provide a standby  letter of credit of $23  million  under which we
could  potentially  be  required  to fund a  portion  of one of the  franchisee  loan
 pools.  Any  funding  under the guarantees  or letters of credit  would be secured by
the  franchisee  loans and any  related  collateral.  We believe that we have
appropriately  provided for our estimated probable  exposures under these contingent
 liabilities.  These provisions  were  primarily  charged to  facility  actions.  New
loans are not  currently  being  added to either loan pool.


We have guaranteed  certain lines of credit and loans of  Unconsolidated  Affiliates
 totaling $28 million at December 27,  2003. Our  Unconsolidated  Affiliates had total revenues of over
$1.5 billion for the year ended  December 27, 2003 and assets and debt of  approximately
 $858 million and $41  million,  respectively,  at December 27, 2003.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

See Note 2.

Canada Unconsolidated Affiliate Dissolution

On November 10, 2003 our  Unconsolidated  Affiliate that  previously  operated 479
KFC, 236 Pizza Hut and 18 Taco Bell restaurants  in Canada was dissolved.  We owned 50%
of this  Unconsolidated  Affiliate  prior to its  dissolution  and accounted for our
interest under the equity  method.  Upon  dissolution,  the Company  assumed  operation
and acquired all  associated  assets of the Pizza Huts,  as well as 17 Taco Bells and 5
KFCs.  The Company  also  acquired the real estate  associated  with  140 KFCs  for
 which  the  Company  will not be the  operator.  Our  former  partner  in the
Unconsolidated  Affiliate  acquired full ownership of all other assets, as well as the
franchise rights to operate 474 KFCs and one Taco Bell.  Our former  partner  retained 10
KFCs and sold the  remainder of these  assets and  franchise rights  acquired to a
 newly-formed,  publicly-held  Income Trust in Canada,  of which our former  partner now
holds a minority  interest.  The Company  leases  land and  buildings  for KFCs it does
not operate to the Income  Trust under operating and capital lease  agreements  through
2018.  The Company will continue to receive a franchise  royalty from the KFCs operated
by our former partner and the Income Trust.

The Company realized an immaterial gain upon dissolution of the  Unconsolidated
 Affiliate.  This gain was realized as the fair value of our  increased  ownership  in
the assets  received  was  greater  than our  carrying  value in those assets, and was
net of expenses associated with the dissolution of the Unconsolidated Affiliate.

The  impact  of the  restructuring  on our  2003  results  of  operations  was not
 significant.  As a  result  of the restructuring,  2004 Company  sales are expected to
increase by  approximately  $165  million and  franchise  fees are expected to decrease
by approximately $10 million.  The impact on net income is not expected to be material.

Amendment of Sale-Leaseback Agreements

As discussed in Note 14 and on page 18 of this MD&A, in 2003 we amended two
 sale-leaseback  agreements assumed in our 2002  acquisition  of YGR. We estimate the
impact of these  amendments in 2004 to be a decrease in  restaurant  profit of $8 million
and a decrease in interest expense of $10 million.

Puerto Rico Business Held for Sale

Our Puerto Rican  business has been held for sale since the fourth  quarter of 2002.
 While a sale of the Puerto Rican business has not yet occurred,  we continue to believe
that it is probable  that a sale will occur during 2004.  Sales and restaurant profits of
the Puerto Rican business were $187 million and $34 million in 2003.

Contingent Lease Guarantees

Under terms of our separation  agreements at the time of the Spin-off,  we indemnified
PepsiCo for any losses incurred related  to their  guarantees  of lease  agreements  of
 certain  non-core  businesses  which  were sold  prior to the Spin-off.  Two of these
 businesses,  Chevys  Mexican  Restaurant  (Chevys) and Hot 'n Now (HNN) filed for
 bankruptcy protection in October 2003 and January 2004,  respectively.  While we cannot
 presently  determine our liability under these  indemnities,


if any,  we do not  expect the amount to have a  material  impact on our  Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Any
costs  incurred will be charged to AmeriServe  and other charges  (credits).  See Note 24
for further discussion.

Pension Plan Funded Status

Certain of our employees are covered under  noncontributory  defined  benefit pension
plans.  The most  significant of these  plans was  amended in 2001 such that  employees
 hired  after  September  30,  2001 are no longer  eligible  to participate.  As of our
September 30, 2003 measurement  date, these plans had a projected benefit  obligation  (“PBO”)
of $629 million,  an accumulated  benefit  obligation  (“ABO”) of $563 million and a fair
value of plan assets of $438 million.  As a result of the $125 million  underfunded
 status of the plans relative to the ABO at September 30, 2003, we have recorded a $101
million charge to shareholders’ equity (net of tax of $61 million) as of December 27,
2003.

The PBO and  ABO  reflect  the  actuarial  present  value  of all  benefits  earned
 to  date  by  employees.  The PBO incorporates  assumptions as to future  compensation
levels while the ABO reflects only current  compensation  levels. Due to the  relatively
 long time frame over which  benefits  earned to date are expected to be paid,  our PBO
and ABO are highly  sensitive  to changes in discount  rates.  We measured  our PBO and
ABO using a discount  rate of 6.25% at September  30, 2003. A 50 basis point  increase in
this discount  rate would have  decreased our PBO by  approximately $58 million at
September 30, 2003.  Conversely,  a 50 basis point  decrease in this discount rate would
have increased our PBO by approximately $60 million at September 30, 2003.

Our expected  long-term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. We believe that this
 assumption is  appropriate  given the  composition  of our plan assets and  historical
 market returns  thereon.  Given no change to the  market-related value of our plan
assets as of September 30, 2003, a one  percentage  point  increase or decrease in our
expected rate of return on plan assets  assumption  would  decrease or  increase,
 respectively,  our 2004  pension  plan expense by approximately $4 million.

The losses our plan assets have experienced,  along with the decrease in discount
rates,  have largely  contributed to the  unrecognized  actuarial  loss of $230 million
in our plans as of September 30, 2003.  For purposes of determining 2003 expense our
funded  status was such that we  recognized  $6 million of  unrecognized  actuarial  loss
in 2003. We will recognize  approximately  $19 million of unrecognized  actuarial loss in
2004. Given no change to the assumptions at our  September 30, 2003  measurement  date,
 actuarial  loss  recognition  will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in
2004 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline.

In total,  we  expect  pension  expense  to  increase  approximately  $14  million  to
$54  million  in 2004.  We have incorporated  this  incremental  expense  into our
 operating  plans  and  outlook.  The  increase  is  driven  by the recognition  of
actuarial  losses as discussed in the preceding  paragraph and an increase in interest
cost because of the higher PBO. Service  cost will also  increase  as a result of the
lower  discount  rate,  though,  as  previously mentioned,  the plans are closed to new
 participants.  A 50 basis point change in our  discount  rate  assumption  of 6.25% at
September 30, 2003 would impact our 2004 pension expense by approximately $11 million.

We do not believe that the underfunded  status of the pension plans will materially
 affect our financial  position or cash flows in 2004 or future  years.  Given  current
 funding  levels and discount  rates we would  anticipate  making contributions  to fully
 fund the  pension  plans over the course of the next five  years.  We believe  our cash
flows from  operating  activities  of  approximately  $1  billion  per year  are
 sufficient  to allow us to make  necessary contributions to the plans, and anticipated
 fundings have been incorporated  into our cash flow projections.  We have included known
and expected  increases in our pension  expense as well as future  expected plan
 contributions  in our operating plans and outlook.

Avian Flu

In several Asian markets, including Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia,
 Malaysia,  Singapore and certain sections of China,  avian flu has  impacted  retail
sales trends and sales trends at KFC through the date of this Form 10-K.  Based on
 information  as of the date of this Form 10-K,  the Company  believes  that the most
likely effect of avian flu


outbreaks in these  markets,  some of which are  completely
 franchised markets,  will be short term.  Additionally, the Company  currently does not expect
that the avian flu outbreak will  materially  affect its chicken supply in Asia or other
markets.

Our most significant market that has been affected by the avian flu is China.  As we have previously stated, if the avian flu outbreak
were to affect the entire country of China for up to two months (through the end of March, 2004) with sales declines in
the range of 20% at KFC, 2004 diluted EPS results for the Company would be unfavorably impacted by up to $0.02.  We have
incorporated this potential unfavorable impact in our operating plans and outlook.

AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits)

During 2004, we expect to recover  approximately  $10 million  related to recoveries
 from the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy reorganization  process.  We expect that this will
 substantially  complete our  recoveries  related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization process.  See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other
charges (credits).

Critical Accounting Policies

Our  reported  results  are  impacted  by the  application  of certain  accounting
 policies  that  require us to make subjective or complex  judgments.  These  judgments
 involve  estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and may
 significantly  impact our  quarterly  or annual  results of  operations  or  financial
 condition. Changes in the estimates and judgements  could  significantly  affect our
results of operations,  financial  condition and cash flows in future  years.  A
description  of what we consider to be our most  significant  critical  accounting
policies follows.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived  assets for impairment at the individual  restaurant
 level.  Restaurants held and used are evaluated  for  impairment  on a  semi-annual
 basis or whenever  events or  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of a
restaurant  may not be  recoverable  (including a decision to close a restaurant).  Our
 semi-annual  test includes  those  restaurants  that have  experienced  two  consecutive
 years of operating  losses.  These  impairment evaluations  require  an  estimation  of
cash  flows  over  the  remaining  useful  life of the  primary  asset of the restaurant,
 which  can be for a  period  of over 20  years,  and any  terminal  value.  We  limit
 assumptions  about important  factors such as sales growth and margin  improvement to
those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at
comparable restaurants.

If the  long-lived  assets  of a  restaurant  on a held and used  basis are not
 recoverable  based  upon  forecasted, undiscounted  cash flows,  we write the assets
down to their fair value.  This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted
 cash flows,  including  terminal  value,  of the restaurant at an appropriate  rate. The
discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed
to exist.

When it is  probable  that we will  sell a  restaurant,  we write  down the
 restaurant  to its fair  value.  We often refranchise  restaurants in groups and
therefore  perform  impairment  evaluations  at the group level.  Fair value is based on
the expected sales proceeds less  applicable  transaction  costs.  Estimated  sales
proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical  sales  multiples or bids from
buyers,  and have  historically  been  reasonably  accurate estimations of the proceeds
ultimately received.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We  record  impairment  charges  related  to  an  investment  in  an  unconsolidated
  affiliate  whenever  events  or circumstances  indicate that a decrease in the value of
an investment has occurred which is other than  temporary.  In addition,  we evaluate our
 investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates for impairment  when they have  experienced
two consecutive  years of operating  losses.  Our  impairment  measurement  test for an
 investment  in an  unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our  restaurants
 except that we use  discounted  cash flows after interest and taxes instead  of
 discounted  cash  flows


before  interest  and taxes as used for our  restaurants.  The
fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates is generally significantly in
excess of their carrying value.

See Note 2 for a  further  discussion  of our  policy  regarding  the  impairment  of
 investments  in  unconsolidated affiliates.

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate  goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets for  impairment on an
annual basis or more often if an event occurs or  circumstances  change that  indicates
 impairment  might exist.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of
fair value of our reporting  units to their  carrying  values.  Our reporting  units are
our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units  internationally
 (typically  individual  countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay
for the reporting  unit,  and is generally  estimated by discounting expected  future
cash flows from the  reporting  units over twenty  years plus an expected  terminal
 value.  We limit assumptions  about important  factors such as sales growth and margin
 improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit.

For 2003,  there was no impairment of goodwill  identified  during our annual
 impairment  testing.  For our reporting units with goodwill,  the fair value is
generally  significantly  in excess of the recorded  carrying value.  Thus, we do not
believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current
business  performance.  For 2002, we impaired $5 million of goodwill related to the Pizza
Hut France reporting unit.

Our impairment  test for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets consists of a
comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Our  indefinite-lived
 intangible assets consist of values assigned to  trademarks/brands of which we have
 acquired  ownership (or the right to a perpetual  royalty-free  license in the case of A&W). We
believe the value of these  trademarks/brands  is  derived  from the  royalty  we avoid,
 in the case of  Company  stores,  or receive,   in  the  case  of  franchise   stores,
  due  to  our   ownership  of  or   royalty-free   license  of  the trademarks/brands.
 Thus, anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing  trademarks/brands.
 We limit assumptions  about sales growth,  as well as other factors  impacting  the fair
value  calculation,  to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable
Concept.

The most significant  recorded  trademark/brand  assets resulted when we acquired YGR
in 2002. Upon this  acquisition, $140  million  and  $72  million  were  allocated  to
the LJS and A&W  trademarks/brands,  respectively.  The  results generated  to date from
the YGR  acquisition  on an  overall  basis  have met our  expectations.  We also now
 believe opportunities  exist  beyond  those  assumed  in  justification  of our
 acquisition  price with  regard to  increased penetration  of LJS,  for both
 stand-alone  units  and as a  multibrand  partner.  Accordingly,  we now  believe  our
system’s  development  capital,  at least  through the term of our current  projections,
 will be  primarily  directed towards LJS.

The decision to focus  short-term  development on increased  penetration  of LJS and
 discretionary  capital  spending limits have resulted in less than  originally  planned
 development  of A&W in the near term.  Additionally,  while we continue to view A&W as a
viable  multibrand  partner,  subsequent to  acquisition  we decided to close or
refranchise all  Company-owned  A&W restaurants that we had acquired.  These  restaurants
were low-volume,  mall-based units, that were  inconsistent  with the  remainder of our
 Company-owned  portfolio.  We  incorporated  these plans into our fair value  estimates
of the LJS and A&W  trademarks/brands  in 2003. As sales  projections for LJS were in
excess of those originally  assumed when valuing the LJS  trademark/brand,  the
 trademark/brand’s  current fair value is in excess of its carrying  value.  Both the
decision to close the  Company-owned  A&W units and the decision to focus on short-term
development  opportunities  at LJS  negatively  impacted the fair value of the A&W  trademark/brand.
 Accordingly,  we recorded a charge of $5 million in 2003 to write the value of A&W trademark/brand
down to its fair value.

While we believe the sales  assumptions  used in our  determination of the fair value
of the A&W  trademark/brand  are reasonable  and  consistent  with our  operating  plans
and  forecasts,  fluctuations  in the  assumptions  would have impacted our  impairment
 calculation.  If the long-term  rate of sales growth used in our  determination  of the
fair value of the A&W  trademark/brand  would have been one percentage  point higher,
 the  trademark/brand  would not have been  impaired.  Alternatively,  if the  long-term
 rate of sales growth would have been one  percentage  point lower, additional impairment
of approximately $4 million would have been recognized.


See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables and Contingent Liabilities

We reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire  receivable  balance based upon
pre-defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence  of other events that  indicate  that
we may not collect the balance  due. As a result of  reserving  using this  methodology,
 we have an immaterial  amount of receivables  that are past due that have not been
reserved for at December 27, 2003.  See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies
regarding franchise and license operations.

Primarily as a result of our  refranchising  efforts,  we remain liable for certain
lease  assignments and guarantees. We record a liability for our exposure under these
lease  assignments  and  guarantees  when such exposure is probable and  estimable.  At
December 27, 2003, we have recorded an immaterial  liability for our exposure which we
consider to be probable  and  estimable.  The  potential  total  exposure  under such
 leases is  significant,  with $326  million representing  the present  value of the
minimum  payments of the assigned  leases at December 27, 2003,  discounted at our
pre-tax cost of debt.  Current  franchisees  are the primary  lessees under the vast
majority of these leases.  We generally have  cross-default  provisions  with these
 franchisees  that would put them in default of their  franchise agreement  in the event
of  non-payment  under the lease.  We believe  these  cross-default  provisions
 significantly reduce the risk that we will be  required to make  payments  under these
 leases and,  historically,  we have not been required  to  make  such  payments  in
 significant  amounts.  See  Note  24 for a  further  discussion  of our  lease
guarantees.

Self-Insured Property and Casualty Losses

We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred  self-insured
 property and casualty  claims.  The estimate is based on the results of an  independent
 actuarial  study and  considers  historical  claim  frequency  and severity  as well as
changes  in factors  such as our  business  environment,  benefit  levels,  medical
 costs and the regulatory  environment  that  could  impact  overall  self-insurance
 costs.  Additionally,  a risk  margin  to  cover unforeseen  events  that may occur over
the several  years it takes for claims to settle is  included  in our  reserve,
increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.

See Note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.

Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves

At December 27, 2003, we have a valuation  allowance of $183 million  primarily to
reduce our net  operating  loss and tax  credit  carryforwards  of $231  million  to an
amount  that  will more  likely  than not be  realized.  These net operating  loss  and
tax  credit  carryforwards  exist in many  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions  and  have
 varying carryforward  periods and  restrictions  on usage.  The estimation of future
taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting  ability to
utilize net operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards can significantly change  based
 on  future  events,  including  our  determinations  as to the  feasibility  of  certain
 tax  planning strategies.  Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to
material future changes.

As a matter of course,  we are regularly  audited by federal,  state and foreign tax
authorities.  We provide reserves for  potential  exposures  when we consider it probable
that a taxing  authority may take a sustainable  position on a matter  contrary to our
position.  We evaluate these reserves,  including  interest  thereon,  on a quarterly
basis to insure  that they  have been  appropriately  adjusted  for  events  that may
 impact  our  ultimate  payment  for such exposures.

See Note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes.


Item 7a.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates,
 foreign currency  exchange rates and commodity  prices.  In the normal  course of
business  and in  accordance  with our  policies,  we manage  these risks through a
variety of  strategies,  which may include the use of  derivative  financial and
 commodity  instruments  to hedge our underlying  exposures.  Our policies prohibit the
use of derivative  instruments for trading  purposes,  and we have procedures in place to
monitor and control their use.

Interest Rate Risk

We have a market  risk  exposure  to changes in  interest  rates,  principally  in the
 United  States.  We attempt to minimize  this  risk  and  lower  our  overall  borrowing
 costs  through  the  utilization  of  derivative  financial instruments,  primarily
interest rate swaps.  These swaps are entered into with financial  institutions and have
reset dates and  critical  terms  that  match  those of the  underlying  debt.
 Accordingly,  any  change  in  market  value associated with interest rate swaps is
offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt.

At December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, a  hypothetical  100 basis point  increase
in  short-term  interest  rates would result in a reduction of approximately $3 million
and $6 million,  respectively,  in annual income before income taxes.  The  estimated
 reductions  are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the
volume or  composition  of debt. In addition,  the fair value of our  derivative
 financial  instruments at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 would  decrease
 approximately  $5 million and $8 million,  respectively.  The fair value of our Senior
 Unsecured  Notes at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 would decrease
 approximately  $87 million and $93 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by
discounting the projected cash flows.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

International  operating profit constitutes  approximately 36% of our operating profit
in 2003, excluding  unallocated and corporate  expenses.  In addition,  the  Company’s
net asset  exposure  (defined as foreign  currency  assets less foreign  currency
  liabilities)   totaled   approximately  $1.3  billion  as  of  December  27,  2003.
 Operating  in international  markets  exposes the Company to movements in foreign
 currency  exchange rates.  The Company’s  primary exposures result from our operations
in Asia-Pacific,  the Americas and Europe.  Changes in foreign currency  exchange rates
would impact the translation of our investments in foreign  operations,  the fair value
of our foreign  currency denominated  financial  instruments and our reported  foreign
 currency  denominated  earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 27,
2003,  operating profit would have decreased $49 million if all foreign  currencies had
uniformly  weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar.  The estimated  reduction  assumes
no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices.

We attempt to minimize the exposure  related to our investments in foreign  operations
by financing those  investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash
in local  currencies when possible.  In addition,  we attempt to minimize the exposure
 related to foreign  currency  denominated  financial  instruments  by  purchasing  goods
and services  from  third  parties  in  local  currencies  when  practical.
 Consequently,  foreign  currency  denominated financial  instruments  consist primarily
of intercompany  short-term  receivables and payables.  At times, we utilize forward
 contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency  denominated
 financial  instruments.  The notional  amount and maturity  dates of these  contracts
 match those of the  underlying  receivables or payables such that our foreign currency
exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk  associated with
commodity  prices.  Our ability to recover  increased costs through higher pricing is, at
times,  limited by the  competitive  environment in which we operate.  We manage our
exposure to this risk  primarily  through  pricing  agreements as well as, on a limited
basis, commodity


future and option  contracts.  Commodity  future and option  contracts
 entered  into for the fiscal  years ended  December 27, 2003,  and December 28, 2002,
 did not  significantly  impact our financial  position,  results of operations or cash
flows.

Cautionary Statements

From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements,  we present  “forward-looking
 statements”  within the meaning of Section 27A of the  Securities Act of 1933, as
amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The
 statements  include  those  identified by such words as “may,”  “will,”  “expect,” “project,”
“anticipate,”  “believe,”  “plan” and
other  similar  terminology.  These  “forward-looking  statements”  reflect  our current
 expectations  regarding  future  events  and  operating  and  financial  performance
 and are based upon data available  at the time of the  statements.  Actual  results
 involve  risks and  uncertainties,  including  both those specific to the Company and
those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from expectations.

Company risks and uncertainties  include,  but are not limited to, potentially
 substantial tax contingencies  related to the Spin-off,  which, if they occur,  require
us to indemnify  PepsiCo,  Inc.;  changes in effective tax rates; our debt leverage and
the attendant potential  restriction on our ability to borrow in the future;  potential
 unfavorable variances between estimated and actual  liabilities;  our ability to secure
 distribution of products and equipment to our  restaurants on favorable  economic  terms
and our ability to ensure  adequate  supply of restaurant  products and equipment in our
stores;  effects and outcomes of legal claims involving the Company;  the  effectiveness
of operating initiatives  and  advertising  and  promotional  efforts;  the ongoing
 financial  viability  of our  franchisees  and licensees;  the  success  of our
 refranchising  strategy;  volatility  of  actuarially  determined  losses  and  loss
estimates;  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including
 pronouncements  promulgated by standard setting bodies.

Industry risks and uncertainties  include,  but are not limited to, economic and
political conditions in the countries and  territories  where we operate,  including
 effects of war and terrorist  activities;  changes in legislation  and governmental
 regulation;  new product and concept development by us and/or our food industry
competitors;  changes in commodity,  labor, and other operating costs; changes in
competition in the food industry;  publicity which may impact our business and/or
industry;  severe weather  conditions;  volatility of commodity  costs;  increases in
minimum wage and other operating costs;  availability and cost of land and construction;
 consumer  preferences,  spending patterns and  demographic  trends;  political or
economic  instability  in local  markets and changes in currency  exchange and interest
rates;  the impact that any widespread  illness or general health concern may have on our
business and/or the economy of the countries in which we operate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share data)

Note 1 - Description of Business

YUM!  Brands,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  (collectively  referred to as “YUM” or the  “Company”)
 comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and since May 7, 2002,
Long John Silver’s  (“LJS”) and A&W  All-American  Food Restaurants  (“A&W”)  (collectively
the “Concepts”),  which were added when we acquired Yorkshire Global  Restaurants, Inc. (“YGR”).
 YUM is the world’s largest quick service  restaurant  company based on the number of
system units, with over 33,000 units in more than 100 countries and territories of which
 approximately  37% are located outside the U.S. YUM was created as an  independent,
 publicly-owned  company on October 6, 1997 (the  “Spin-off  Date”) via a tax-free
distribution  by  our  former  parent,  PepsiCo,  Inc.  (“PepsiCo”),  of  our  Common
 Stock  (the  “Distribution”  or “Spin-off”) to its shareholders.  References to YUM
throughout these Consolidated  Financial Statements are made using the first person
notations of “we,” “us” or “our.”

Through our widely-recognized  Concepts, we develop,  operate,  franchise and license
a system of both traditional and non-traditional  quick service restaurants.  Each
Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high
quality  ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
 appealing,  tasty and attractive  food  at  competitive  prices.  Our  traditional
 restaurants  feature  dine-in,  carryout  and,  in  some instances,  drive-thru or
delivery service.  Non-traditional  units, which are principally  licensed outlets,
 include express  units and kiosks which have a more  limited  menu and operate in
 non-traditional  locations  like  airports, gasoline  service  stations,   convenience
 stores,  stadiums,  amusement  parks  and  colleges,  where  a  full-scale traditional
 outlet would not be  practical or  efficient.  We are  actively  pursuing the strategy
of  multibranding, where two or more of our Concepts are operated in a single unit.  In
addition,  we are testing  multibranding  options involving  one of our Concepts  and
either a concept in  development,  such as Pasta Bravo,  or a concept not owned or
affiliated with YUM.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our  preparation of the  accompanying  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in
conformity  with  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in the United  States of
America  requires  us to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect reported
 amounts of assets and  liabilities,  disclosure  of  contingent  assets and  liabilities
 at the date of the financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from the estimates.

Principles of Consolidation  and Basis of Preparation.

Intercompany  accounts and
transactions  have been eliminated. Certain  investments  in businesses  that operate our
Concepts are accounted for by the equity method.  Generally,  we possess 50% ownership of
and 50% voting rights over these  affiliates.  Our lack of majority  voting rights
 precludes us from controlling  these affiliates,  and thus we do not consolidate  these
affiliates.  Our share of the net income or loss of those unconsolidated affiliates is
included in other (income) expense.

We  participate  in  various  advertising  cooperatives  with our  franchisees  and
 licensees.  In  certain  of these cooperatives  we possess  majority  voting rights,
 and thus control the  cooperatives.  As the  contributions  to the cooperatives  are
 designated  for  advertising  expenditures,  any cash  held by  these  cooperatives  is
 considered restricted and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
 Such restricted cash was  approximately  $34 million and $44 million at December  27,
2003 and  December  28, 2002,  respectively.  As the  contributions  to these
cooperatives  are  designated and segregated for  advertising,  we act as an agent for
the  franchisees  and licensees with regard to these  contributions.  Thus, in accordance
with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (“SFAS”) No. 45,  “Accounting  for
Franchise Fee Revenue,” we do not reflect  franchisee  and licensee  contributions  to
these cooperatives in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Fiscal Year.

Our fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in December  and, as a
result,  a  fifty-third  week is added every five or six years.  Fiscal year 2000
 included 53 weeks.  The  Company’s  next fiscal year with 53 weeks will be 2005.  The
first three  quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and the fourth  quarter
 consists of 17 weeks in fiscal  years  with 53


weeks and 16 weeks in fiscal  years  with
52 weeks.  Our  subsidiaries  operate  on  similar fiscal  calendars  with period end
dates suited to their  businesses.  The  subsidiaries’  period end dates are within one
week of YUM’s period end date with the exception of our  international  businesses,
 which close one period or one month earlier to facilitate consolidated reporting.

Reclassifications.

We have  reclassified  certain items in the  accompanying
 Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes  thereto for prior  periods to be
 comparable  with the  classification  for the fiscal year ended  December 27, 2003.
 These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.

Franchise and License  Operations.

We execute franchise or license  agreements for
each unit which sets out the terms of our  arrangement  with the  franchisee  or
licensee.  Our franchise and license  agreements  typically  require the franchisee or
licensee to pay an initial,  non-refundable  fee and  continuing  fees based upon a
percentage of sales. Subject to our approval and payment of a renewal fee, a franchisee
 may generally  renew the franchise  agreement upon its expiration.

We  recognize  initial fees as revenue  when we have  performed  substantially  all
initial  services  required by the franchise or license  agreement,  which is generally
 upon the opening of a store.  We  recognize  continuing  fees as earned.  We recognize
 renewal fees in income when a renewal  agreement  becomes  effective.  We include
 initial fees collected  upon the sale of a  restaurant  to a franchisee  in
 refranchising  gains  (losses).  Fees for  development rights are capitalized and
amortized over the life of the development agreement.

We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities and their
 representative  organizations and our company  operated  restaurants.  These  expenses,
 along with other costs of servicing  of  franchise  and license agreements  are charged
to general and  administrative  expenses as incurred.  Certain  direct costs of our
 franchise and license  operations are charged to franchise and license  expenses.  These
costs include  provisions for estimated uncollectible  fees,  franchise and license
marketing funding,  amortization  expense for franchise related intangible assets and
certain  other direct  incremental  franchise and license  support  costs.  Franchise and
license  expenses also includes rental income from subleasing restaurants to franchisees
net of the related occupancy costs.

We monitor the financial  condition of our  franchisees  and licensees and record
 provisions for estimated  losses on receivables  when we believe that our  franchisees
or licensees are unable to make their required  payments.  While we use the best
 information  available in making our  determination,  the ultimate  recovery of recorded
 receivables is also  dependent  upon  future  economic  events and other  conditions
 that may be beyond  our  control.  Included  in franchise  and license  expense in 2003
is a net benefit for  uncollectible  franchise and license  receivables  of $3 million as
we were able to recover  previously  reserved  receivables in excess of provisions made.
Net provisions for uncollectible  franchise  and  license  receivables  of $15 million
and $24 million  were  included in  franchise  and license expense in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Direct  Marketing  Costs.

We report  substantially  all of our direct marketing costs
in occupancy and other operating expenses.  We charge  direct  marketing  costs to
 expense  ratably in  relation  to  revenues  over the year in which incurred and, in the
case of advertising  production  costs, in the year the  advertisement  is first shown.
 Deferred direct  marketing  costs,  which  are  classified  as  prepaid  expenses,
 consist  of media and  related  advertising production  costs  which  will  generally
 be used for the  first  time in the next  fiscal  year.  To the  extent  we participate
in advertising  cooperatives,  we expense our  contributions as incurred.  At the end of
2003 and 2002, we had deferred marketing costs of $3 million and $8 million,
 respectively.  Our advertising expenses were $419 million, $384 million and $328 million
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses,  which we
expense as incurred,  are reported in general and  administrative  expenses.  Research
and development  expenses were $26 million in 2003 and $23 million in both 2002 and 2001.

Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets.

Effective  December  30,  2001,  the
 Company  adopted  SFAS No. 144, “Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
 Long-Lived  Assets”  (“SFAS  144”).  SFAS 144  retained  many of the


fundamental  provisions  of SFAS No. 121,  “Accounting  for the  Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets
and for  Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” (“SFAS 121”), but resolved  certain
 implementation  issues  associated with that Statement. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not
have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In accordance  with SFAS 144, we review our long-lived  assets  related to each
 restaurant to be held and used in the business,  including any allocated  intangible
 assets  subject to  amortization,  semi-annually  for  impairment,  or whenever  events
 or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of a  restaurant
 may  not be recoverable.  We evaluate  restaurants  using a “two-year  history of
 operating  losses” as our primary  indicator of potential  impairment.  Based  on the
 best  information  available,  we  write  down an  impaired  restaurant  to its
estimated fair market value,  which becomes its new cost basis.  We generally  measure
 estimated fair market value by discounting  estimated  future  cash flows.  In
 addition,  when we decide to close a  restaurant  it is reviewed  for impairment and
 depreciable  lives are adjusted.  The impairment  evaluation is based on the estimated
cash flows from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected
terminal value.

The Company has adopted  SFAS No. 146,  “Accounting  for Costs  Associated  with Exit
or Disposal  Activities”  (“SFAS 146”),  effective for exit or disposal activities that
were initiated after December 31, 2002. Costs addressed by SFAS 146 include costs to
terminate a contract  that is not a capital  lease,  costs of  involuntary  employee
 termination benefits  pursuant  to a  one-time  benefit  arrangement,  costs to
 consolidate  facilities  and  costs  to  relocate employees.  SFAS 146 changes the
timing of expense  recognition  for certain costs we incur while closing  restaurants or
undertaking  other exit or disposal  activities;  however,  the timing  difference is not
typically  significant in length.  Adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material  impact
on our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements for the year ended December 27, 2003.

Store  closure  costs  include  costs of  disposing  of the  assets as well as other
 facility-related  expenses  from previously  closed stores.  These store closure costs
are generally  expensed as incurred.  Additionally,  at the date we cease using a
property under an operating  lease,  we record a liability for the net present value of
any remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income, if any.

Refranchising  gains  (losses)  includes  the gains or losses from the sales of our
 restaurants  to new and  existing franchisees and the related initial franchise fees,
 reduced by transaction costs and direct  administrative  costs of refranchising.  In
executing our  refranchising  initiatives,  we most often offer groups of restaurants.
 We classify restaurants as held for sale and suspend  depreciation  and  amortization
 when (a) we make a decision to refranchise; (b) the stores can be  immediately  removed
from  operations;  (c) we have begun an active  program to locate a buyer; (d)
 significant  changes  to the plan of sale are not  likely;  and (e) the sale is
 probable  within  one  year.  We recognize  estimated  losses on  refranchisings  when
the  restaurants  are  classified as held for sale. We recognize gains on restaurant
 refranchisings  when the sale  transaction  closes,  the  franchisee  has a minimum
amount of the purchase price in at-risk  equity,  and we are satisfied that the
 franchisee can meet its financial  obligations.  If the  criteria  for gain  recognition
 are not met,  we defer  the gain to the  extent  we have a  remaining  financial
exposure in connection with the sales  transaction.  Deferred gains are recognized when
the gain recognition  criteria are met or as our  financial  exposure  is  reduced.  When
we make a decision  to retain a store  previously  held for sale,  we revalue  the store
at the lower of its (a) net book value at our  original  sale  decision  date less normal
depreciation  and  amortization  that would have been recorded during the period held for
sale or (b) its current fair market  value.  This value  becomes  the store’s new cost
 basis.  We charge (or  credit) any  difference  between the store’s  carrying amount and
its new cost basis to  refranchising  gains (losses).  When we make a decision to close a
store previously held for sale, we reverse any previously  recognized  refranchising
 loss and then record  impairment and store  closure  costs as  described  above.
 Refranchising  gains  (losses)  also  include  charges for  estimated exposures  related
to those partial  guarantees of franchisee loan pools and contingent lease  liabilities
which arose from refranchising activities.  These exposures are more fully discussed in
Note 24.

SFAS 144 also  requires the results of  operations  of a component  entity that is
 classified as held for sale or has been  disposed  of be  reported  as  discontinued
 operations  in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income if  certain conditions  are met.
These  conditions  include  elimination of the operations and cash flows of the component
 entity from  the  ongoing  operations  of the  Company  and no  significant  continuing
 involvement  by the  Company  in the operations of the component  entity after the
disposal  transaction.  The results of operations of stores meeting both these
 conditions  that


were  disposed  of in 2003 or 2002 or  classified  as held for sale at
 December  27,  2003 or December 28, 2002 were not material for any of the three years
ended December 27, 2003.

Considerable  management  judgment is necessary to estimate  future cash flows,
 including cash flows from  continuing use, terminal value, closure costs,  sublease
income, and refranchising  proceeds.  Accordingly,  actual results could vary
significantly from our estimates.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated  Affiliates.

We record impairment
 charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated  affiliate whenever events or
circumstances  indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which
is other than  temporary.  In addition,  we evaluate our investments in  unconsolidated
 affiliates for impairment when they have  experienced two consecutive  years of
operating  losses.  Our impairment  measurement  test for an  investment  in an
 unconsolidated  affiliate  is  similar  to that  for  our  restaurants  except  that we
use discounted  cash flows after  interest and taxes  instead of discounted  cash flows
before  interest and taxes as used for our restaurants.

Considerable  management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, including cash flows from continuing use,
terminal value,  closure costs,  sublease income,  and  refranchising  proceeds.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.

Asset Retirement  Obligations.

Effective  December 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 143,  “Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations”  (“SFAS  143”).  SFAS  143
 addresses  the  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  legal obligations
 associated with the retirement of tangible  long-lived  assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. As a result of  obligations  under  certain  leases  that are within
 the scope of SFAS 143,  the  Company  recorded a cumulative  effect  adjustment  of $2
million ($1 million  after tax) which did not have a material  effect on diluted earnings
 per  common  share.  The  adoption  of SFAS  143 also did not have a  material  impact
 on our  Consolidated Financial  Statements  for the year ended  December 27, 2003. If
SFAS 143 had been adopted as of the beginning of 2002 or 2001, the cumulative  effect
 adjustment  would not have been  materially  different from that recorded on December
29, 2002.

Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both  Liabilities and Equity.

The
Company has adopted SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain  Financial  Instruments  with
 Characteristics  of both  Liabilities and Equity” (“SFAS 150”). SFAS 150  establishes
 standards for how an issuer  classifies  and measures three classes of  freestanding
 financial instruments  with  characteristics  of both  liabilities  and equity.  It
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument  that is within its scope as a
liability  (or an asset in some  circumstances).  SFAS 150 was effective for financial
 instruments  entered into or modified  after May 31, 2003,  and otherwise was effective
at the beginning of the first interim  period  beginning  after June 15, 2003.  The
Company has not entered into or modified any financial instruments  within the scope of
SFAS 150 since May 31, 2003,  nor does it currently  hold any  significant  financial
instruments within its scope.

Guarantees.

The  Company  has  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)
  Interpretation  No.  45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for
Guarantees,  Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation
of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB  Interpretation  No. 34” (“FIN
45”). FIN 45 elaborates on the  disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual  financial  statements about its obligations  under guarantees  issued.  FIN 45
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize,  at inception of a guarantee,
 a liability for the fair value of certain obligations  undertaken.  The initial
recognition and measurement  provisions were applicable to certain  guarantees  issued or
modified after December 31, 2002.  While the nature of our business  results in the
issuance of certain  guarantees  from time to time,  the adoption of FIN 45 did not have
a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December
27, 2003.

We have also issued  guarantees  as a result of assigning  our interest in
 obligations  under  operating  leases as a condition to the  refranchising  of certain
Company  restaurants.  Such guarantees are subject to the  requirements of SFAS No. 145,
 “Rescission  of FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13, and Technical Corrections”  (“SFAS  145”).  We recognize a liability for the fair
value of such lease  guarantees  under SFAS 145 at their inception, with the related
expense being included in refranchising gains (losses).


Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash equivalents  represent funds we have temporarily
 invested (with original  maturities not exceeding three months) as part of managing our
day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.

Inventories.

We value our  inventories  at the lower of cost  (computed  on the
 first-in,  first-out  method) or net realizable value.

Property,  Plant and Equipment.

We state  property,  plant and equipment at cost less
 accumulated  depreciation  and amortization,  impairment  writedowns  and valuation
 allowances.  We calculate  depreciation  and  amortization  on a straight-line  basis
 over the  estimated  useful  lives of the assets as  follows:  5 to 25 years for
 buildings  and improvements,  3 to 20 years  for  machinery  and  equipment  and 3 to 7
years  for  capitalized  software  costs.  As discussed above, we suspend depreciation
and amortization on assets related to restaurants that are held for sale.

Internal  Development  Costs  and  Abandoned  Site  Costs.

We  capitalize  direct
 costs  associated  with  the  site acquisition and construction of a Company unit on
that site,  including  direct internal  payroll and  payroll-related costs.  Only those
 site-specific  costs  incurred  subsequent  to the time that the site  acquisition  is
 considered probable are capitalized.  If we subsequently  make a determination  that a
site for which internal  development costs have been capitalized will not be acquired or
developed,  any previously  capitalized  internal  development costs are expensed and
included in general and administrative expenses.

Goodwill and Intangible  Assets.

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 141,  “Business
 Combinations”  (“SFAS 141”).  SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method of
accounting for all business  combinations  and modifies the application of the purchase
 accounting  method.  Goodwill  represents the excess of the cost of a business  acquired
over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired,  including  identifiable
 intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. SFAS 141 specifies  criteria to be used in
determining  whether  intangible assets acquired in a business  combination must be
recognized and reported  separately  from  goodwill.  We base amounts  assigned to
goodwill and other  identifiable intangible assets on independent appraisals or internal
estimates.

The Company has also adopted SFAS No. 142,  “Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets” (“SFAS
142”).  SFAS 142 eliminates the  requirement  to  amortize  goodwill  and
 indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  addresses  the  amortization  of intangible
 assets  with  a  defined  life,  and  addresses  impairment  testing  and  recognition
 for  goodwill  and indefinite-lived  intangible  assets.  As a result of  adopting  SFAS
142,  we ceased  amortization  of  goodwill  and indefinite-lived  intangible  assets
 beginning  December  30,  2001.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, we amortized
goodwill on a straight-line  basis up to 20 years and  indefinite-lived  intangible
 assets on a  straight-line  basis over 3 to 40 years.  We evaluate the remaining  useful
life of an intangible  asset that is not being  amortized  each reporting period to
determine  whether events and  circumstances  continue to support an indefinite useful
life. If an intangible  asset that is not being  amortized is  subsequently  determined
 to have a finite useful life, we amortize the intangible asset  prospectively over its
estimated remaining useful life.  Amortizable  intangible assets continue to be amortized
on a  straight-line  basis over 3 to 40 years. As discussed  above,  we suspend
 amortization on those intangible assets with a defined life that are allocated to
restaurants that are held for sale.

In  accordance  with the  requirements  of SFAS 142,  goodwill has been  assigned to
 reporting  units for purposes of impairment  testing.  Our  reporting  units are our
 operating  segments  in the U.S.  (see Note 23) and our  business management  units
 internationally   (typically  individual  countries).   Goodwill  impairment  tests
 consist  of  a comparison of each  reporting  unit’s fair value with its carrying
 value.  The fair value of a reporting  unit is the amount for which the unit as a whole
could be sold in a current  transaction  between  willing  parties.  We generally
estimate  fair value based on  discounted  cash flows.  If the  carrying  value of a
reporting  unit  exceeds its fair value,  goodwill is written down to its implied fair
value.  We have selected the  beginning of our fourth  quarter as the date on which to
perform our ongoing annual  impairment  test for goodwill.  For 2003,  there was no
impairment of goodwill  identified  during  our annual  impairment  testing.  For 2002,
 goodwill  assigned  to the Pizza Hut France reporting unit was deemed impaired and
written off.  The charge of $5 million was recorded in facility actions.


For  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  our  impairment  test  consists  of a
 comparison  of the fair value of an intangible  asset with its  carrying  amount.  Fair
value is the price a willing  buyer  would pay for the  intangible asset and is generally
 estimated  by  discounting  the  expected  future cash flows  associated  with the
 intangible asset. We also perform our annual test for impairment of our
 indefinite-lived  intangible  assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter.  Our
 indefinite-lived  intangible assets consist of values assigned to certain
 trademarks/brands we have  acquired.  When  determining  the fair value,  we limit
 assumptions  about  important  factors such as sales growth  to those  that are
 supportable  based on our  plans  for the  trademark/brand.  As  discussed  in Note 12,
we recorded a $5 million  charge in 2003 as a result of the  impairment of an
 indefinite-lived  intangible  asset.  This charge was recorded in facility actions.

See Note 12 for further discussion of SFAS 142.

Stock-Based  Employee  Compensation.

At December 27, 2003,  the Company had four
 stock-based  employee  compensation plans in  effect,  which  are  described  more
 fully in Note 18.  The  Company  accounts  for those  plans  under the recognition and
measurement  principles of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,  “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related  Interpretations.  No stock-based  employee
 compensation  cost is reflected in net income, as all options  granted  under those
plans had an exercise  price equal to the market value of the  underlying  common stock
on the date of grant.  The following  table  illustrates  the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition  provisions of
SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,” to stock-based employee
compensation.

Derivative Financial  Instruments.

Our policy prohibits the use of derivative
 instruments for trading purposes,  and we have  procedures  in place to monitor  and
 control  their use.  Our use of  derivative  instruments  has  included interest rate
swaps and collars,  treasury locks and foreign currency  forward  contracts.  In
addition,  on a limited basis we utilize  commodity  futures  and  options  contracts.
 Our  interest  rate and  foreign  currency  derivative contracts  are entered  into with
 financial  institutions  while our  commodity  derivative  contracts  are  exchange
traded.

We account  for  derivative  financial  instruments  in  accordance  with SFAS No.
 133,  “Accounting  for  Derivative Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities”  (“SFAS  133”)
as amended  by SFAS No.  149,  “Amendment  of  Statement  133 on Derivative  Instruments
 and Hedging  Activities”  (“SFAS 149”).  SFAS 133 requires that all derivative
 instruments be recorded on the Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value.  The
accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e.,  gains or losses) of a derivative
 instrument is dependent upon whether the  derivative has been  designated and qualifies
as part of a hedging  relationship  and further,  on the type of hedging  relationship.
 For derivative  instruments that are  designated  and  qualify as a fair value  hedge,
 the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument  as well as the offsetting  gain or loss
on the  hedged  item  attributable  to the  hedged  risk are  recognized  in the  results
 of operations.  For derivative  instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash
flow hedge,  the effective  portion of the gain or loss on the derivative  instrument is
reported as a component of other comprehensive  income (loss) and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged  transaction  affects
 earnings.  Any ineffective  portion of the gain or loss on the


derivative  instrument is  recorded  in the  results  of  operations immediately.  For  derivative  instruments
 not designated as hedging  instruments,  the gain or loss is recognized in the  results
 of  operations  immediately.  See  Note  16 for a  discussion  of our  use  of
 derivative  instruments, management of credit risk inherent in derivative  instruments
and fair value information  related to debt and interest rate swaps.

New  Accounting   Pronouncements  Not  Yet  Adopted.

In  January  2003,  the  FASB
 issued   Interpretation  No.  46, “Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities,  an
interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 was subsequently revised in December
 2003.  FIN 46 addresses the  consolidation  of entities  whose equity holders have
either (a) not provided  sufficient  equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its
own  activities or (b) do not possess  certain characteristics of a controlling
 financial  interest.  FIN 46 requires the consolidation of these entities,  known as
variable  interest  entities  (“VIEs”),  by the primary  beneficiary  of the entity.  The
primary  beneficiary  is the entity,  if any,  that is subject to a majority of the risk
of loss from the VIE's  activities,  entitled to receive a majority  of the VIEs
 residual  returns,  or both.  FIN 46 is  effective  for all  entities  at the end of the
 first reporting  period  ending  after March 15,  2004 (the  quarter  ending  March 20,
 2004 for the  Company).  FIN 46 was effective for  special-purpose  entities (as defined
by FIN 46) at the end of the first reporting  period ending after December 15, 2003,
which did not impact the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  FIN 46 requires certain
 disclosures in  financial  statements  issued  after  December  31,  2003,  if it is
 reasonably  possible  that the Company  will consolidate or disclose information about
VIEs when FIN 46 becomes effective.

FIN 46 excludes  from its scope  businesses  (as defined by FIN 46) unless  certain
 conditions  exist.  We believe the franchise  entities which operate our restaurants,
 including our Unconsolidated  Affiliates,  meet the definition of a business.  Thus, we
are currently  evaluating  whether any of the  aforementioned  conditions  exist that
would subject any of our  franchisees,  including  our  Unconsolidated  Affiliates,  to
the  provisions  of FIN 46,  requiring  us to determine  if they are VIEs,  and, if so,
 whether we are the  primary  beneficiary.  We do not  possess any  ownership interests
in our franchisees except for our investments in various  Unconsolidated  Affiliates
 accounted for under the equity method (see Note 24 for further  description).
 Additionally,  we generally do not provide  financial support to our  franchisees in a
typical  franchise  relationship.  While we continue to evaluate the  applicability  of
FIN 46 to our franchise  relationships,  at this time we do not believe that the required
consolidation of franchise entities, if any, would materially impact our Financial
Statements.

The Company,  along with  representatives  of the  franchisee  groups of each of its
Concepts,  has formed  purchasing cooperatives  for the  purpose  of  purchasing  certain
 restaurant  products  and  equipment  in the U.S.  Our equity ownership in each
cooperative is generally  proportional to our percentage  ownership of the U.S. system
units for the Concept.  We are  continuing to evaluate  whether any of these
 cooperatives  are VIEs under the  provisions of FIN 46 and, if so, whether we are the
primary  beneficiary.  We do not currently believe that  consolidation will be required
for these cooperatives as a result of our adoption of FIN 46.

As  discussed  further in Note 24, we have  posted a $12 million of letter of credit
 supporting  our  guarantee  of a franchisee  loan pool.  Additionally,  we have provided
a standby letter of credit of $23 million under which we could potentially  be required
to fund a portion of this loan pool.  The  letters of credit were issued  under our
 existing bank credit  agreement.  This loan pool, which is not held or funded by an
affiliate of the Company,  primarily funded purchases of restaurants  from the Company
and, to a lesser extent,  franchisee  development of new  restaurants.  The total  loans
 outstanding  under this loan pool were  approximately  $87  million at December  27,
 2003.  Our maximum exposure  to loss as a result of our  involvement  with this loan
pool was $28 million at December  27,  2003.  During the  year  ended  December  27,
 2003 the  entity  which  holds  this  loan  pool  sold  these  loans to a  qualifying
special-purpose  entity  (“QSPE”) as described in SFAS No. 140,  “Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities” and
settled its existing  obligations with the proceeds.  As QSPEs are not within the scope
of FIN 46, the  Company  will not be  required  to  consolidate  the entity  that now
holds this loan pool.

Note 3 - Two-for-One Common Stock Split

On May 7, 2002,  the Company  announced  that its Board of Directors  approved a
 two-for-one  split of the  Company’s outstanding  shares of Common  Stock.  The stock
split was effected in the form of a stock  dividend and entitled each


shareholder of record at the close of business on June 6, 2002 to receive one additional  share for
every  outstanding share  of  Common  Stock  held on the  record  date.  The  stock
 dividend  was  distributed  on June 17,  2002,  with approximately  149 million  shares
of common stock  distributed.  All per share and share amounts in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and Notes to the  Financial  Statements  have been
 adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Note 4 - YGR Acquisition

On May 7, 2002,  YUM  completed  its  acquisition  of YGR. At the date of
 acquisition,  YGR  consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise LJS units,
 respectively,  and 127 and 742 company and  franchise  A&W units,  respectively.  In
addition,  133 multibranded  LJS/A&W  restaurants  were included in the LJS unit totals.
 This acquisition was made to facilitate our strategic  objective of achieving growth
through  multibranding,  where two or more of our Concepts are operated in a single
 restaurant  unit.  We paid  approximately  $275  million in cash and assumed
 approximately  $48 million of bank  indebtedness  in  connection  with the  acquisition
 of YGR. The purchase  price was allocated to the assets  acquired  and  liabilities
 assumed  based on estimates  of their fair values at the date of  acquisition.  We
determined  these fair values with the assistance of a third party valuation  expert.
 The following table  summarizes the fair values of YGR's assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the date of acquisition.

Of the $250 million in acquired  intangible  assets,  $212 million was assigned to
 trademarks/brands.  The  remaining acquired  intangible assets primarily consist of
franchise  contract rights which will be amortized over thirty years, the  typical  term
 of a YGR  franchise  agreement  including  renewals.  Of the  $212  million  in
 trademarks/brands approximately  $191  million  and $21  million  were  assigned  to the
 U.S.  and  International  operating  segments, respectively.  Of the  remaining  $38
million in  intangible  assets,  approximately  $31 million and $7 million  were assigned
to the U.S. and International operating segments, respectively.

The $209 million in goodwill  was assigned to the U.S.  operating  segment.  As we
acquired the stock of YGR,  none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income
tax purposes.

Liabilities  assumed included  approximately  $48 million of bank  indebtedness  that
was paid off prior to the end of the  second  quarter  of  2002  and  approximately  $11
 million  in  capital  lease  obligations.   We  also  assumed approximately  $168
 million in present  value of future rent  obligations  related to three  existing
 sale-leaseback agreements  entered into by YGR involving  approximately  350 LJS units.
As a result of liens held by the buyer/lessor on certain  personal  property within the
units, the  sale-leaseback  agreements were accounted for as financings upon acquisition.
 As discussed  further in Note 14, two of these  sale-leaseback  agreements  were amended
during 2003 and are now being accounted for as operating leases.

As of the date of acquisition we recorded  approximately $49 million of reserves (“exit
 liabilities”)  related to our plans to consolidate  certain support functions,  and exit
certain markets through store  refranchisings and closures, as  presented in


the table
 below.  The  consolidation  of certain  support  functions  included  the  termination
 of approximately  100  employees.  Our remaining  exit  liabilities,  as well as amounts
 utilized  through cash payments during 2003 and 2002, are presented below.

We expensed  integration  costs of approximately $4 million in 2003 and $6 million in
2002 related to the acquisition. These costs were  recorded as AmeriServe  and other
charges  (credits).  See Note 7 for further  discussion  regarding AmeriServe and other
charges (credits).

The results of  operations  for YGR have been  included in our  Consolidated
 Financial  Statements  since the date of acquisition.  If the  acquisition  had been
 completed as of the  beginning  of the years ended  December 28, 2002 and December 29,
2001, pro forma Company sales and franchise and license fees would have been as follows:



Company sales

$  7,139

$  6,683

The impact of the acquisition,  including interest expense on debt incurred to finance
the acquisition,  on net income and diluted  earnings per share would not have been
 significant  in 2002 and 2001.  The pro forma  information is not necessarily
 indicative of the results of operations had the  acquisition  actually  occurred at the
beginning of each of these periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

Note 6 - Earnings Per Common Share (“EPS”)

Unexercised  employee  stock options to purchase  approximately  4 million,  1.4
million and 5.1 million shares of our Common Stock for the years ended December 27, 2003,
 December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,  respectively,  were not included in the
 computation of diluted EPS because their  exercise  prices were greater than the average
market price of our Common Stock during the year.

Note 7 - Items Affecting Comparability of Net Income

Facility Actions

Facility actions consists of the following components:

Refranchising net (gains) losses;

Store closure costs;

Impairment  of  long-lived  assets for stores we intend to close and stores we intend to  continue  to use in
         the business;

Impairment of  goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 142.


(a)

$3 million in 2001.  See Note 9.

(b)

In
2001,  U.S.  refranchising  net (gains) losses included $12 million of previously
 deferred  refranchising      gains and  International  refranchising net (gains) losses
included a charge of $11 million to mark to market the      net assets of the Singapore
 business,  which was held for sale.  The Singapore  business was  subsequently  sold
     during the third quarter of 2002. In 2003,  International  refranchising  net
(gains) losses included a charge of      approximately $16 million to write down the
carrying value of the Puerto Rican business to fair value.

(c)

In
2003, we recorded a $5 million  charge in the U.S.  related to the  impairment of the A&W  trademark/brand
     (see further  discussion at Note 12). In 2002, we recorded a $5 million  charge in
 International  related to the      impairment of the goodwill of the Pizza Hut France
reporting unit.

The following  table  summarizes the carrying values of the major classes of assets
held for sale at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002.  U.S.  amounts  primarily
 represent land on which we previously  operated  restaurants and are net of  impairment
 charges of $2 million and $4 million at December 27, 2003 and  December  28,  2002,
 respectively. The carrying values in International  relate  primarily to our Puerto
Rican business,  which we wrote down $16 million during 2003 to reflect then current
 estimates of its fair value.  These  write-downs were recorded as a refranchising loss.
The carrying  values of  liabilities of the Puerto Rican business that we anticipate
 will be assumed by a buyer were not significant at December 27, 2003 or at December 28,
2002.

AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits)

AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc.  (“AmeriServe”)  was the primary  distributor of
food and paper supplies to our U.S. stores when it filed for  protection  under  Chapter
11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code on January 31,  2000.  A plan of reorganization  for
AmeriServe  (the “POR”) was approved on November 28, 2000,  which resulted in, among
other things, the assumption of our  distribution  agreement,  subject to certain
 amendments,  by McLane  Company,  Inc. During the AmeriServe  bankruptcy  reorganization
 process, we took a number of actions to ensure continued supply to our system. Those
 actions  resulted in  significant  expense for the Company,  primarily  recorded in
2000.  Under the POR we are entitled to proceeds from certain residual assets, preference
claims and other legal recoveries of the estate.


We classify  expenses and recoveries  related to AmeriServe,  as well as integration
 costs related to our acquisition of YGR,  costs to defend  certain wage and hour
 litigation  and certain other items,  as AmeriServe and other charges (credits).  These
amounts were classified as unusual items in previous years.

Income of $26  million was  recorded  as  AmeriServe  and other  charges  (credits)
 for 2003 and  primarily  includes recoveries  related to the  AmeriServe  bankruptcy
 reorganization  process.  Income of $27  million  was  recorded as AmeriServe  and other
charges  (credits) for 2002,  primarily  resulting  from  recoveries  related to the
 AmeriServe bankruptcy  reorganization process,  partially offset by integration costs
related to our acquisition of YGR and costs to defend  certain  wage and hour
 litigation.  Income of $3 million was  recorded  as  AmeriServe  and other  charges
(credits) for 2001, which primarily included recoveries related to the AmeriServe
 bankruptcy  reorganization  process offset by aggregate settlement costs associated with
certain litigation,  and expenses,  primarily severance,  related to decisions  to
 streamline  certain  support  functions.  The reserves  related to decisions to
 streamline  certain support functions were utilized in 2002.

On November 10, 2003 our unconsolidated affiliate in Canada was dissolved.  Upon dissolution, the Company assumed
operation of certain units that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate.  The Company also assumed
ownership of the assets related to the units that it now operates, as well as the real estate associated with certain
units previously owned and operated by the unconsolidated affiliate that are now operated by franchisees (either our
former partner in the unconsolidated affiliate or a publicly-held Income Trust in Canada).  The acquired real estate
associated with the units that are not operated by the Company is being leased to the franchisees.  The resulting
reduction in our investments in unconsolidated affiliates ($56 million at November 10, 2003) was primarily offset by
increases in property, plant and equipment, net and capital lease receivables (included in other assets).  The Company
realized an immaterial gain upon the dissolution of the unconsolidated affiliate.  This gain was realized as the fair
value of our increased ownership in the assets received was greater than our carrying value in those assets, and was net
of expenses associated with the dissolution.

The
Company's business  combinations have included acquiring  restaurants from our
franchisees.  Prior to the      adoption of SFAS 141,  the primary  intangible  asset to
which we  generally  allocated  value in these  business      combinations was reacquired
 franchise  rights.  We determined that reacquired  franchise rights did not meet the
     criteria of SFAS 141 to be  recognized  as an asset apart from  goodwill.
 Accordingly,  on December 30, 2001, we      reclassified $241 million of reacquired
franchise rights to goodwill,  net of related deferred tax liabilities of      $53
million, ($27 million for the U.S. and $26 million for International).

$ 243

The most  significant  recorded  trademark/brand  assets  resulted  when we acquired
YGR in 2002.  The fair value of a trademark/brand  is determined  based upon the value
derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or  receive,  in the
case of  franchise  and  licensee  stores,  for the use of the  trademark/brand.  This
fair value determination is thus largely dependent upon our estimation of sales
attributable to the trademark/brand.

The fair  value of the LJS  trademark/brand  was  determined  to be in excess of its
 carrying  value  during our 2003 annual  impairment  test.  The  estimate of sales
 attributable  to the LJS  trademark/brand  at the date of this test reflected the
 opportunities we believe exist with regard to increased  penetration of LJS, for both
stand-alone units and as a multibrand  partner.  Accordingly,  we now believe our system's
 development  capital,  at least  through the term of our current projections, will be
primarily directed towards LJS.

The decision to focus short-term  development  largely on increased  penetration of
LJS and our discretionary  capital spending  limits have resulted in less than
 originally  planned  development  of A&W in the near term.  Additionally, while we
 continue  to view A&W as a viable  multibrand  partner,  subsequent  to  acquisition  we
decided to close or refranchise all  Company-owned  A&W restaurants that we had acquired.
 These  restaurants were low-volume,  mall-based units that were  inconsistent  with the
 remainder of our  Company-owned  portfolio.  Both the decision to close these
Company-owned A&W units and the decision to focus on short-term  development
 opportunities at LJS negatively impacted the fair value of the A&W  trademark/brand.
 Accordingly,  we recorded a $5 million charge in 2003 to facility actions to write the
value of the A&W trademark/brand down to its fair value.

Historically,  we have considered the assets acquired  representing  trademark/brand
 to have indefinite  useful lives due to our expected use of the asset and the lack of
legal, regulatory,  contractual,  competitive,  economic or other factors  that may limit
their  useful  lives.  As required by SFAS 142, we  reconsider  the  remaining  useful
life of indefinite-life  intangible  assets each  reporting  period.  Subsequent to the
recording of the impairment of the A&W trademark/brand,  we began  amortizing  its
 remaining  balance over a period of thirty years (less than $1 million of amortization
 expense was recorded in 2003). While we continue to incorporate  development of the A&W  trademark/brand
into our  multibranding  plans,  our  decision  to no  longer  operate  the  acquired
 stand-alone  Company-owned  A&W restaurants  is  considered  a factor  that limits its
useful  life.  Accordingly,  we are  amortizing  the  remaining balance of the A&W  trademark/brand
 over


a period of thirty  years,  the  typical  term of our  multibrand  franchise
agreements  including  renewals.  We continue to believe that all of our other  recorded
 trademark/brand  assets have indefinite lives.

As a result  of  adopting  SFAS 142,  we ceased  amortization  of  goodwill  and
 indefinite-lived  intangible  assets beginning  December 30, 2001.  Amortization
 expense for  definite-lived  intangible assets was $7 million in 2003 and $6 million in
2002,  respectively.  Amortization  expense for  goodwill and all  intangible  assets was
$37 million in 2001.  Amortization  expense for  definite-lived  intangible assets will
approximate $9 million in 2004, $8 million in 2005 and 2006, and $7 million in both 2007
and 2008.

Note 14 - Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt


Our primary bank credit  agreement  comprises a senior  unsecured  Revolving  Credit
Facility (the “Credit  Facility”) which  matures on June 25,  2005.  On December 26,
 2003,  we  voluntarily  reduced our maximum  borrowings  under the Credit  Facility
 from $1.2  billion to $1.0  billion.  The  Credit  Facility  is  unconditionally
 guaranteed  by our principal  domestic  subsidiaries  and contains  financial  covenants
 relating to  maintenance  of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit
Facility also contains  affirmative and negative covenants  including,  among other
things,  limitations  on  certain  additional  indebtedness,  guarantees  of
 indebtedness,  level of cash  dividends, aggregate  non-U.S.  investment  and certain
other  transactions  as defined in the  agreement.  We were in compliance with all debt
covenants at December 27, 2003.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility,  we may borrow up to the maximum  borrowing
limit less outstanding  letters of credit.  At December 27, 2003, our unused Credit
Facility totaled $737 million,  net of outstanding  letters of credit of $263  million.
 There  were no  borrowings  outstanding  under the  Credit  Facility  at the end of the
 year.  The interest rate for borrowings  under the Credit  Facility  ranges from 1.0% to
2.0% over the London  Interbank  Offered Rate  (“LIBOR”) or 0.00% to 0.65% over an
Alternate  Base Rate,  which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds
 Effective Rate plus 0.50%.  The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as
applicable,  will depend upon our performance  under specified  financial  criteria.
 Interest on any outstanding  borrowings  under the Credit Facility  is payable at least
 quarterly.  In 2003,  2002 and 2001,  we expensed  facility  fees of  approximately  $6
million,  $5 million and $4 million,  respectively.  At December 28, 2002, the weighted
average  contractual  interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility
was 2.6%.

In 1997, we filed a shelf  registration  statement with the Securities and Exchange
 Commission for offerings of up to $2 billion of senior  unsecured  debt. In June 2002,
we issued $400 million of 7.70% Senior  Unsecured  Notes due July 1, 2012 (the “2012
 Notes”).  The net  proceeds  from the  issuance of the 2012 Notes were used to repay
 indebtedness under the Credit  Facility.  Additionally,  we capitalized  debt issuance
costs of approximately $5 million related to the 2012 Notes in the third quarter of 2002.
The following  table  summarizes all Senior  Unsecured Notes issued under this shelf
registration through December 27, 2003:

We have $150 million remaining for issuance under the $2 billion shelf registration.

In connection  with our acquisition of YGR in 2002, we assumed  approximately  $168
million in present value of future rent obligations related to three existing
 sale-leaseback  agreements entered into by YGR involving approximately 350 LJS units.
 As a result of liens  held by the  buyer/lessor  on  certain  personal  property  within
 the  units,  the sale-leaseback  agreements  were accounted for as financings upon
 acquisition.  On August 15, 2003, we amended two of these  sale-leaseback  agreements to
remove the liens on the personal  property  within the units.  As the two amended
agreements now qualify for  sale-leaseback  accounting,  they will be accounted for as
operating leases.  Accordingly, the future rent obligations  associated with the two
amended agreements,  previously recorded as long-term debt of $88 million,  are no


longer
 reflected on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet as of December 27, 2003.  There was no
gain or loss recorded as a result of this transaction.

The annual  maturities of long-term debt as of December 27, 2003,  excluding capital
lease obligations of $112 million and derivative instrument adjustments of $29 million,
are as follows:

Interest  expense on  short-term  borrowings  and long-term  debt was $185  million,

Note 15 - Leases

We  have  non-cancelable   commitments  under  both  capital  and  long-term
 operating  leases,   primarily  for  our restaurants.  Capital  and  operating  lease
 commitments  expire at various  dates  through  2087 and, in many cases, provide for
rent  escalations  and renewal  options.  Most leases  require us to pay related
 executory  costs,  which include property taxes, maintenance and insurance.

Future  minimum  commitments  and amounts to be received as lessor or sublessor  under
 non-cancelable  leases are set forth below:

Note 16 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Instruments

Interest  Rates

- We enter into  interest  rate swaps and forward rate  agreements
 with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest  rate risk and  lowering
 interest  expense for a portion of our debt.  Under the  contracts,  we agree with other
parties to exchange,  at specified  intervals,  the difference  between  variable rate
and fixed rate amounts  calculated on a notional  principal  amount.  At December 27,
2003 and December 28, 2002, we had  outstanding pay-variable  interest  rate swaps with
notional  amounts of $350  million.  These swaps have reset dates and floating rate
indices which match those of our underlying  fixed-rate  debt and have been  designated
as fair value hedges of a portion of that debt.  As the swaps  qualify  for the
 short-cut  method  under SFAS 133 no  ineffectiveness  has been recorded.  The fair
value of these swaps as of December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 was  approximately
 $31 million and $48 million,  respectively,  and has been included in other  assets.
 The portion of this fair value which has not yet been  recognized  as a reduction to
interest  expense  (approximately  $29 million and $44 million at December 27, 2003 and
December 28, 2002, respectively) has been included in long-term debt.

During 2002, we entered into treasury  locks with notional  amounts  totaling $250
million.  These treasury locks were entered  into to hedge the risk of changes  in future
 interest  payments  attributable  to  changes in the  benchmark interest  rate prior to
issuance  of  additional  fixed-rate  debt.  These  locks were  designated  and
 effective  in offsetting  the  variability  in cash flows  associated  with the future
 interest  payments  on a portion of the 2012 Notes.  Thus, the  insignificant  loss at
which these treasury locks were settled will be recognized as an increase to interest on
the debt through 2012.

Foreign  Exchange

- We enter into foreign  currency  forward  contracts with the
objective of reducing our exposure to cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency
 fluctuations  associated with certain foreign currency denominated financial
 instruments,  the majority of which are  intercompany  short-term  receivables  and
payables.  The notional amount,  maturity date, and currency of these  contracts  match
those of the underlying  receivables or payables.  For those  foreign  currency  exchange
 forward  contracts  that we  have  designated  as cash  flow  hedges,  we  measure
ineffectiveness  by comparing the cumulative  change in the forward contract with the
cumulative  change in the hedged item. No significant  ineffectiveness  was  recognized
in 2003 or 2002 for those foreign  currency  forward  contracts designated as cash flow
hedges.

Commodities

- We also utilize on a limited basis commodity  futures and options
 contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity  price  fluctuations  over the next
twelve months.  Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133.
 Commodity  future and options  contracts  entered  into for the fiscal  years ended
 December  27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 did not significantly impact the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Deferred  Amounts in Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Income (Loss)

- As of December
27, 2003, we had a net deferred loss  associated with cash flow hedges of  approximately
 $2 million,  net of tax. Of this amount,  we estimate that a net  after-tax  loss of
less than $1 million will be  reclassified  into  earnings  through  December  25,  2004.
 The remaining net after-tax loss of  approximately  $2 million,  which arose from the
settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the


issuance of certain  amounts of
our  fixed-rate  debt,  will be  reclassified  into  earnings  from December 26, 2004
through 2012 as an increase to interest expense on this debt.

Credit Risks

Credit risk from  interest rate swap,  treasury lock and forward rate  agreements  and
foreign  exchange  contracts is dependent both on movement in interest and currency rates
and the  possibility  of non-payment by  counterparties.  We mitigate  credit risk by
 entering  into these  agreements  with  high-quality  counterparties,  and netting  swap
and forward rate payments within contracts.

Accounts  receivable  consists  primarily of amounts due from  franchisees  and
licensees  for initial and  continuing fees. In addition,  we have notes and lease
 receivables from certain of our franchisees.  The financial  condition of these
 franchisees  and licensees is largely  dependent  upon the  underlying  business  trends
of our Concepts.  This concentration  of credit risk is mitigated,  in part, by the large
number of franchisees and licensees of each Concept and the short-term nature of the
franchise and license fee receivables.

Fair Value

At December  27, 2003 and December 28, 2002,  the fair values of cash and cash
 equivalents,  short-term  investments, accounts  receivable,  and accounts  payable
 approximated  carrying value because of the  short-term  nature of these instruments.
 The  fair  value of  notes  receivable  approximates  carrying  value  after
 consideration  of  recorded allowances.

The carrying  amounts and fair values of our other  financial  instruments  subject to
fair value  disclosures  are as follows:

We  estimated  the fair  value of debt,  debt-related  derivative  instruments,
 foreign  currency-related  derivative instruments, guarantees and letters of credit
using market quotes and calculations based on market rates.


Note 17 - Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

Pension Benefits

We sponsor  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  substantially
 all  full-time  U.S.  salaried employees,  certain hourly  employees and certain
 international  employees.  The most significant of these plans, the YUM  Retirement
 Plan (the “Plan”),  is funded while benefits from the other plan are paid by the Company
as incurred. During 2001,  the Plan was amended such that any salaried  employee  hired
or rehired by YUM after  September 30, 2001 is not eligible to  participate  in the Plan.
 Benefits  are based on years of service and earnings or stated  amounts for each year of
service.

Postretirement Medical Benefits

Our  postretirement  plan provides health care benefits,  principally to U.S.
 salaried retirees and their dependents. This plan  includes  retiree  cost  sharing
 provisions.  During  2001,  the plan was amended  such that any  salaried employee
 hired or rehired by YUM after  September  30, 2001 is not eligible to  participate  in
this plan.  Employees hired prior to September  30, 2001 are eligible  for  benefits if
they meet age and service  requirements  and qualify for retirement benefits.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare  Prescription  Drug,  Improvement and Modernization
 Act of 2003 (the “Act”),  which introduces  a Medicare  prescription  drug  benefit as
well as a federal  subsidy to sponsors  of retiree  health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least  actuarially  equivalent to the Medicare  benefit,
 was enacted. On January 12, 2004 the FASB issued  Financial  Staff  Position  No. 106a,
 “Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements Related to The  Medicare  Prescription  Drug,
 Improvement  and  Modernization  Act of 2003”  (“FSP  106a”) to discuss certain
 accounting and disclosure  issues raised by the Act. We have elected to defer the
 measurement and disclosure requirements  under the  provisions of FSP 106a until
specific  authoritative  guidance is issued by the FASB later in 2004. The reported
 accumulated  benefit obligation and net periodic benefit costs of our  postretirement
 plan do not reflect the effects of the Act.  The  authoritative  guidance,  when issued,
 could  require  revisions to  previously reported  information.  While we may be
eligible for benefits  under the Act based on the  prescription  drug benefits provided
in our  postretirement  plan, we do not believe such benefits will have a material impact
on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We use a measurement date of September 30 for our pension and post-retirement medical
plans described above.


Obligation and Funded status at September 30:

a contribution made between the September 30, 2002 measurement date and December 28, 2002.

While we are not required to make  contributions to the Plan in 2004, we may make
discretionary  contributions  during the year based on our estimate of the Plan's
expected September 30, 2004 funded status.

There is a cap on our medical liability for certain retirees.  The cap for Medicare

expected to be reached between the years 2007-2008; once the cap is reached, our annual
cost per retiree will not increase.

Our primary  objectives  regarding the pension assets are to optimize  return on
assets subject to acceptable risk and to maintain liquidity,  meet minimum funding
 requirements and minimize plan expenses.  To achieve these objectives we have adopted a
passive  investment  strategy in which the asset  performance  is driven  primarily  by
the  investment allocation.  Our target investment  allocation is 70% equity securities
and 30% debt securities,  consisting primarily of low cost index  mutual  funds that
track  several  sub-categories  of equity  and debt  security  performance.  The
investment  strategy  is  primarily  driven by lower  participant  ages and  reflects a
long-term  investment  horizon favoring a higher equity component in the investment
allocation.

A mutual fund held as an  investment  by the pension  plan  includes YUM stock in the
amounts of $0.2 million and $0.1 million at September 30, 2003 and 2002 (less than 1% of
total plan assets in each instance).

Note 18 - Stock-Based Employee Compensation

At year-end 2003, we had four stock option plans in effect:  the YUM!  Brands,  Inc.
 Long-Term  Incentive Plan (“1999 LTIP”),  the 1997 Long-Term  Incentive Plan (“1997 LTIP”),
 the YUM!  Brands,  Inc.  Restaurant  General Manager Stock Option Plan (“RGM Plan”) and
the YUM!  Brands,  Inc.  SharePower Plan  (“SharePower”).  During 2003, the 1999 LTIP was
amended,  subsequent to  shareholder  approval,  to increase the total number of shares
 available for issuance and to make certain other technical and clarifying changes.


We may grant awards of up to 29.8 million  shares and 45.0  million  shares of stock
under the 1999 LTIP,  as amended, and 1997 LTIP,  respectively.  Potential  awards to
employees and  non-employee  directors under the 1999 LTIP include stock options,
 incentive stock options,  stock appreciation rights,  restricted stock, stock units,
 restricted stock units,  performance shares and performance units.  Potential awards to
employees and non-employee  directors under the 1997 LTIP include stock  appreciation
 rights,  restricted  stock and  performance  restricted  stock units.  Prior to January
1, 2002,  we also could grant stock  options and  incentive  stock options under the 1997
LTIP. We have issued only stock  options and  performance  restricted  stock  units under
the 1997 LTIP and have issued only stock  options under the 1999 LTIP.

We may grant  stock  options  under the 1999 LTIP to purchase  shares at a price equal
to or greater  than the average market  price of the stock on the date of grant.  New
 option  grants  under  the 1999 LTIP can have  varying  vesting provisions  and
 exercise  periods.  Previously  granted  options  under the 1997  LTIP and 1999 LTIP
vest in  periods ranging from immediate to 2007 and expire ten to fifteen years after
grant.

We may  grant  options  to  purchase  up to 15.0  million  shares of stock  under the
RGM Plan at a price  equal to or greater  than the average  market price of the stock on
the date of grant.  RGM Plan options  granted have a four year vesting  period and expire
ten years  after  grant.  We may grant  options to purchase  up to 14.0  million  shares
of stock  at a price  equal to or  greater  than  the  average  market  price  of the
 stock  on the date of grant  under SharePower.  Previously granted SharePower options
have expirations through 2013.

At the Spin-off  Date, we converted  certain of the unvested  options to purchase
 PepsiCo stock that were held by our employees to YUM stock  options  under  either the
1997 LTIP or  SharePower.  We converted  the options at amounts and exercise prices that
maintained the amount of unrealized  stock  appreciation  that existed  immediately
 prior to the Spin-off.  The vesting  dates and  exercise  periods of the options  were
not  affected  by the  conversion.  Based on their original  PepsiCo grant date,  these
converted  options vest in periods ranging from one to ten years and expire ten to
fifteen years after grant.

We estimated  the fair value of each option  grant made during  2003,  2002 and 2001
as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following

In November  1997,  we granted two awards of  performance  restricted  stock units of
YUM's  Common Stock to our Chief Executive  Officer  (“CEO”).  The awards were made under
the 1997 LTIP and may be paid in Common  Stock or cash at the discretion  of the
 Compensation  Committee  of the  Board of  Directors.  Payment  of an award  of $2.7
 million  was contingent  upon  the  CEO's  continued   employment   through   January 25,
  2001  and  our  attainment  of  certain pre-established  earnings  thresholds.  In
January 2001, our CEO received a cash payment of $2.7 million following the Compensation
Committee's  certification of YUM's attainment of the pre-established  earnings
threshold.  Payment of an award of $3.6  million is  contingent  upon his  employment
 through  January 25, 2006 and our  attainment  of certain pre-established  earnings
 thresholds.  The annual  expense  related to these  awards  included in  earnings  was
$0.4 million for 2003, $0.4 million for 2002 and $0.5 million for 2001.

Note 19 - Other Compensation and Benefit Programs

We sponsor two deferred  compensation  benefit programs,  the Restaurant Deferred
 Compensation Plan and the Executive Income Deferral  Program (the “RDC Plan” and the “EID
Plan,”  respectively)  for eligible  employees and  non-employee directors.


Effective  October 1, 2001,  participants  can no longer  defer funds into the RDC
Plan.  Prior to that date,  the RDC Plan allowed  participants to defer a portion of
their annual salary.  The  participant's  balances will remain in the RDC Plan until
their scheduled  distribution  dates.  As defined by the RDC Plan, we credit the amounts
 deferred with earnings based on the investment  options  selected by the  participants.
 Investment  options in the RDC Plan consist of  phantom  shares of  various  mutual
 funds  and YUM  Common  Stock.  We  recognize  compensation  expense  for the
appreciation or depreciation,  if any,  attributable to all investments in the RDC Plan,
and prior to October 1, 2001, for any  matching  contributions.  Our  obligations  under
 the RDC  program  as of the end of 2003 and 2002  were $11 million and $10 million,
 respectively.  We recognized  annual  compensation  expense of $3 million in 2003, less
than $1 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001 for the RDC Plan.

The EID Plan allows  participants  to defer  receipt of a portion of their annual
salary and all or a portion of their incentive  compensation.  As defined by the EID
Plan,  we credit  the  amounts  deferred  with  earnings  based on the investment
 options selected by the participants.  These investment  options are limited to cash and
phantom shares of our Common Stock.  The EID Plan allows  participants  to defer
incentive  compensation  to purchase  phantom shares of our Common  Stock at a 25%
 discount  from the average  market  price at the date of  deferral  (the  “Discount
 Stock Account”).  Participants  bear the risk of  forfeiture  of both the discount and
any amounts  deferred to the Discount Stock  Account if they  voluntarily  separate  from
 employment  during the two year  vesting  period.  We expense the intrinsic  value of
the discount over the vesting  period.  As  investments  in the phantom shares of our
Common Stock can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock, we do not recognize
 compensation  expense for the  appreciation or the  depreciation,  if any, of these
 investments.  Deferrals into the phantom shares of our Common Stock are credited to the
Common Stock Account.

Our  cash  obligations  under  the  EID  Plan as of the end of  2003  and  2002  were
 $25  million  and $24  million, respectively.  We  recognized  compensation  expense of
$3 million in 2003,  $2 million in 2002 and $4 million in 2001 for the EID Plan.

We sponsor a contributory plan to provide  retirement  benefits under the provisions
of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k)  Plan”) for eligible U.S.
 salaried and hourly  employees.  During 2003,  participants  were able to  elect  to
 contribute  up to 25% of  eligible  compensation  on a  pre-tax  basis  (the  maximum
 participant contribution  increased from 15% to 25% effective January 1, 2003).
 Participants may allocate their  contributions to one or any  combination of 10
investment  options within the 401(k) Plan.  Effective  October 1, 2001, the 401(k) Plan
was amended such that the Company matches 100% of the  participant's  contribution  up to
3% of eligible  compensation and 50% of the  participant's  contribution on the next 2%
of eligible  compensation.  All matching  contributions are made to the YUM Common Stock
Fund. Prior to this amendment,  we made a discretionary  matching  contribution  equal to
a  predetermined  percentage  of each  participant's  contribution  to the YUM Common
Stock Fund.  We  determined  our percentage  match at the  beginning of each year based
on the immediate  prior year  performance  of our Concepts.  We recognized as
compensation  expense our total matching  contribution of $10 million in 2003, $8 million
in 2002 and $5 million in 2001.

Note 20 - Shareholders' Rights Plan

In July 1998,  our Board of  Directors  declared a dividend  distribution  of one
right for each share of Common Stock outstanding  as of August 3, 1998 (the “Record  Date”).
 As a result of the  two-for-one  stock split  distributed  on June 17, 2002,  each
holder of Common  Stock is entitled to one right for every two shares of Common  Stock
 (one-half right per  share).  Each  right  initially  entitles  the  registered  holder
to  purchase  a unit  consisting  of one one-thousandth  of a share (a  “Unit”) of Series
A Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  without  par value,  at a purchase price of
$130 per Unit,  subject to  adjustment.  The rights,  which do not have voting  rights,
 will become exercisable  for our  Common  Stock ten  business  days  following  a public
 announcement  that a person or group has acquired,  or has  commenced or intends to
commence a tender offer for, 15% or more,  or 20% or more if such person or group  owned
10% or more on the  adoption  date of this plan,  of our  Common  Stock.  In the event
the rights  become exercisable  for Common Stock,  each right will entitle its holder
(other than the Acquiring  Person as defined in the Agreement)  to purchase,  at the right's
 then-current  exercise  price,  YUM Common Stock having a value of twice the exercise
 price of the right.  In the event the rights  become  exercisable  for Common  Stock and
 thereafter  we are acquired in a merger or other  business  combination,  each right
will


entitle its holder to purchase,  at the right's then-current  exercise price,
 common stock of the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise price of the
right.

We can  redeem  the  rights in their  entirety,  prior to  becoming  exercisable,  at
$0.01 per  right  under  certain specified  conditions.  The rights expire on July 21,
2008,  unless we extend that date or we have earlier redeemed or exchanged the rights as
provided in the Agreement.

This  description  of the rights is qualified in its entirety by  reference to the
original  Rights  Agreement,  dated July 21, 1998,  and the Agreement of  Substitution
 and Amendment of Common Share Rights  Agreement,  dated August 28, 2003,  between YUM
and American  Stock  Transfer and Trust  Company,  the Rights  Agent (both  including
 the exhibits thereto).

Note 21 - Share Repurchase Program

In November 2003, our Board of Directors  authorized a new share  repurchase  program.
 This program  authorizes us to repurchase,  through  May 21,  2005,  up to  $300
 million  of our  outstanding  Common  Stock  (excluding  applicable transaction  fees).
 During 2003, we repurchased  approximately  169,000 shares for  approximately  $5.7
million under this  program at an average  price per share of  approximately  $34.  Based
on market  conditions  and other  factors, additional  repurchases may be made from time
to time in the open market or through privately negotiated  transactions at the
discretion of the Company.

In November  2002,  our Board of Directors  authorized a share  repurchase  program.
 This  program  authorized  us to repurchase up to $300 million  (excluding  applicable
 transaction  fees) of our outstanding  Common Stock. This share repurchase  program  was
 completed  in 2003.  During  2003,  we  repurchased  approximately  9.2  million  shares
for approximately  $272 million at an average price per share of  approximately  $30
under this  program.  During 2002, we repurchased  approximately  1.2  million  shares
 for  approximately  $28  million  at an  average  price per share of approximately $24
under this program.

In February  2001,  our Board of Directors  authorized a share  repurchase  program.  This  program  authorized  us to
repurchase up to $300 million  (excluding  applicable  transaction  fees) of our outstanding  Common Stock. This share
repurchase  program  was  completed  in 2002.  During  2002,  we  repurchased  approximately  7.0  million  shares for
approximately  $200 million at an average price per share of  approximately  $29 under this  program.  During 2001, we
repurchased  approximately  4.8  million  shares for  approximately  $100  million  at an  average  price per share of
approximately $21 under this program.

Note 22 - Income Taxes

The details of our income tax provision  (benefit)  are set forth below.  Amounts do
not include the income tax benefit of approximately $1 million on the $2 million
 cumulative  effect  adjustment  recorded on December 29, 2002 due to the adoption of
SFAS 143.


Taxes  payable were reduced by $26 million,  $49 million and $13 million in 2003,
 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  as a result of stock option  exercises.  In addition,
 goodwill and other intangibles were reduced by $8 million in 2001 as a result of the
settlement of a disputed claim with the Internal  Revenue  Service  relating to the
 deductibility  of reacquired  franchise  rights and other  intangibles  offset by an $8
million  reduction in deferred and accrued taxes payable.

Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states increased by $6 million ($4 million, net of
federal tax) and $1 million ($1 million, net of federal tax) and in foreign countries increased by $19 million and $6
million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a result of determining that it is more likely than not that certain
loss carryforwards will not be utilized prior to expiration.  In 2001, valuation allowances related to deferred tax
assets in certain states and foreign countries were reduced by $9 million ($6 million, net of federal tax) and $6
million, respectively, as a result of determining that these assets will be utilized prior to expiration.

The  deferred  foreign  tax  provision  for both 2002 and 2001  included a $2 million
 credit to reflect the impact of changes in statutory tax rates in various countries.

We amended  certain prior year returns in 2003 upon our  determination  that it was
more beneficial to claim credit on our U.S.  tax  returns  for foreign  taxes paid than
to deduct  such  taxes,  as had been done when the  returns  were originally filed.  The
benefit for amending such returns will be non-recurring.


The details of 2003 and 2002 deferred tax liabilities (assets) are set forth below:

A determination of the  unrecognized  deferred tax liability for temporary
 differences  related to our investments in foreign subsidiaries and investments in
foreign  unconsolidated  affiliates that are essentially permanent in duration is not
practicable.

We have  available net operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards  totaling
 approximately  $1.5 billion at December 27, 2003 to reduce future tax of YUM and certain
 subsidiaries.  The  carryforwards are related to a number of foreign and state
 jurisdictions.  Of these  carryforwards,  $18  million  expire in 2004 and $1.2  billion
 expire at various times between 2005 and 2021.  The remaining carryforwards of
approximately $313 million do not expire.

Note 23 - Reportable Operating Segments

We are principally engaged in developing,  operating,  franchising and licensing the
worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  concepts,  and since May 7, 2002,  the LJS and A&W concepts,
 which were added when we acquired YGR. KFC,  Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell,  LJS and A&W  operate
 throughout  the U.S.  and in 88, 86, 12, 3 and 13  countries  and  territories outside
the U.S.,  respectively.  Our five largest  international markets based on operating
profit in 2003 are China, United  Kingdom,  Australia,  Canada  and  Korea.  At  December
 27,  2003,  we had  investments  in 9  unconsolidated affiliates  outside  the U.S.
 which  operate  principally  KFC and/or  Pizza Hut  restaurants.  These  unconsolidated
affiliates  operate  in China,  Japan,  Poland  and the  United  Kingdom.  Additionally,
 we had an  investment  in an unconsolidated affiliate in the U.S. which operates Yan Can
restaurants.

We identify  our  operating  segments  based on  management  responsibility  within
the U.S.  and  International.  For purposes of applying  SFAS No. 131,  “Disclosure
 About  Segments of An  Enterprise  and Related  Information”  (“SFAS 131”),  we
 consider  LJS and A&W to be a single  segment.  We  consider  our KFC,  Pizza Hut,  Taco
Bell and  LJS/A&W operating  segments to be similar and therefore  have  aggregated  them

Note 24 - Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Guarantees and Contingencies

As a  result  of  (a)  assigning  our  interest  in  obligations  under  real  estate
 leases  as a  condition  to the refranchising  of certain  Company  restaurants;  (b)
 contributing  certain  Company  restaurants  to  unconsolidated affiliates;  and (c)
guaranteeing  certain other leases,  we are frequently  contingently  liable on lease
agreements. These  leases have  varying  terms,  the latest of which  expires in 2030.
 As of December  27, 2003 and  December 28, 2002, the potential  amount of  undiscounted
 payments we could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary  lessee
was $411  million and $426  million,  respectively.  The present  values of these
 potential  payments discounted  at our pre-tax  cost of debt at December  27,  2003 and
 December  28,  2002,  were $326  million and $310 million,  respectively.  Our
 franchisees  are the  primary  lessees  under  the vast  majority  of these  leases.  We
generally have  cross-default  provisions  with these  franchisees  that would put them
in default of their  franchise agreement  in the event of  non-payment  under the lease.
 We believe  these  cross-default  provisions  significantly reduce the risk that we will
be required to make payments  under these  leases.  Accordingly,  the liability  recorded
for our exposure under such leases at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, was not
material.

Guarantees  Supporting  Financial  Arrangements  of Certain  Franchisees,
 Unconsolidated  Affiliates and Other Third Parties

At December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002,  we had provided  approximately  $32
million of partial  guarantees of two loan pools related primarily to the Company's
historical  refranchising  programs and, to a lesser extent,  franchisee development  of
new  restaurants.  In support of one of these  guarantees,  we have  posted $32  million
of letters of credit.  We also provide a standby  letter of credit of $23 million  under
which we could  potentially  be required to fund a portion  of one of the  franchisee
 loan  pools.  The total  loans  outstanding  under  these  loan  pools were
approximately  $123 million at December  27,  2003.  Any funding  under the  guarantees
 or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related
 collateral.  We believe that we have  appropriately  provided for our estimated
 probable  exposures  under  these  contingent  liabilities.  These  provisions  were
 primarily  charged to refranchising (gains) losses.  New loans are not currently being
added to either loan pool.

We have  guaranteed  certain  lines of credit and loans of  unconsolidated  affiliates
 totaling  $28  million and $26 million at December 27, 2003 and December  28, 2002,
 respectively. Our  unconsolidated  affiliates  had total revenues of over $1.5 billion for the year
ended December 27, 2003 and assets and debt of  approximately  $858 million and $41
million, respectively, at December 27, 2003.


We have also  guaranteed  certain lines of credit,  loans and letters of credit of
third parties  totaling $8 million and $15 million at December  27, 2003 and December
 28,  2002,  respectively.  If all such lines of credit and letters of credit were fully
drawn the maximum  contingent  liability  under these  arrangements  would be
 approximately  $25 million as of December 27, 2003 and $27 million as of December 28,
2002.

We have  varying  levels  of  recourse  provisions  and  collateral  that  mitigate
 the risk of loss  related  to our guarantees of these financial  arrangements of
 unconsolidated  affiliates and other third parties.  Accordingly,  our recorded
liability as of December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 is not significant.

Insurance Programs

We are  self-insured  for a  substantial  portion  of  our  current  and  prior  years'  coverage
 including  workers' compensation,   employment  practices  liability,   general
 liability,   automobile  liability  and  property  losses (collectively,  “property  and
casualty  losses”).  To mitigate  the cost of our  exposures  for certain  property and
casualty  losses,  we make annual  decisions to  self-insure  the risks of loss up to
defined  maximum per  occurrence retentions  on a line by line  basis or to  combine
 certain  lines of  coverage  into  one  loss  pool  with a single self-insured
 aggregate  retention.  The Company then  purchases  insurance  coverage,  up to a
specified  limit,  for losses that exceed the  self-insurance  per occurrence or
aggregate  retention.  The insurers'  maximum aggregate loss limits are significantly
 above our actuarially  determined probable losses;  therefore,  we believe the
likelihood of losses exceeding the insurers' maximum aggregate loss limits is remote.

We are also self-insured for healthcare  claims for eligible  participating  employees
subject to certain  deductibles and  limitations.  We have  accounted for our retained
 liabilities  for property and casualty  losses and  healthcare claims,  including
 reported and  incurred  but not reported  claims,  based on  information  provided by
 independent actuaries.

Due to the inherent  volatility  of  actuarially  determined  property and casualty
loss  estimates,  it is reasonably possible that we could  experience  changes in
estimated losses which could be material to our growth in quarterly and annual net
income.  We believe that we have  recorded  reserves for property and casualty  losses at
a level which has substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of adverse
developments and/or volatility.

Change of Control Severance Agreements

The Company has severance  agreements with certain key executives (the  “Agreements”)
 that are renewable on an annual basis.  These  Agreements are triggered by a
termination,  under certain  conditions,  of the  executive's  employment following a
change in control of the Company,  as defined in the  Agreements.  If triggered,  the
affected  executives would  generally  receive twice the amount of both their annual base
salary and their annual  incentive in a lump sum, a  proportionate  bonus at the higher
of target or actual  performance,  outplacement  services and a tax gross-up for any
excise  taxes.  These  Agreements  have a  three-year  term and  automatically  renew
each  January 1 for  another three-year  term unless the Company elects not to renew the
Agreements.  If these  Agreements had been triggered as of December 27, 2003,  payments
of  approximately  $38 million would have been made. In the event of a change of control,
rabbi trusts would be  established  and used to provide  payouts under  existing
 deferred and incentive  compensation plans.

Litigation

We are subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to  lawsuits,  taxes,
 environmental  and other  matters arising out of the normal course of business.  Like
certain other large retail  employers,  the Company has been faced in certain states with
allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 29,  1997,  a class  action  lawsuit  against  Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Bravo,  et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Bravo”),  was filed in the Circuit  Court of the
State of Oregon of the County of  Multnomah.  The lawsuit was filed by two former Taco
Bell shift  managers  purporting  to  represent  approximately  17,000  current  and
former  hourly employees statewide.  The lawsuit alleged violations of state wage and
hour laws,  principally  involving unpaid wages including  overtime,  and


rest and meal
period violations,  and sought an unspecified amount in damages.  Under Oregon class
 action  procedures,  Taco Bell was allowed an  opportunity  to “cure” the unpaid wage
and hour  allegations  by opening a claims  process to all putative  class members prior
to  certification  of the class.  In this cure process, Taco Bell paid out less than $1
million.  On January 26, 1999,  the Court  certified a class of all current and former
shift managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged  violations.  A
 Court-approved  notice and claim form was mailed to  approximately  14,500  class
 members on January  31,  2000.  Trial  began on January 4, 2001.  On March 9, 2001, the
jury reached  verdicts on the  substantive  issues in this matter.  A number of these
verdicts were in favor of the Taco Bell position;  however,  certain issues were decided
in favor of the plaintiffs.  In April 2002, a jury trial to  determine  the damages of 93
of those  claimants  found that Taco Bell failed to pay for certain meal breaks and/or
 off-the-clock work for 86 of the 93 claimants.  However,  the total amount of hours
awarded by the jury was  substantially  less than that sought by the  claimants.  In July
and September  2002,  the court ruled on several post-trial  motions,  including  fixing
the total number of potential  claimants at 1,031  (including the 93 claimants for which
damages had already been  determined)  and holding that  claimants  who prevail are
entitled to  prejudgment interest and penalty  wages.  The second damages trial for the
remaining 938 claimants  began on July 7, 2003.  Before the trial  concluded,  the
 parties  reached an  agreement  to settle  this matter in full.  The court  granted
 final approval of the  settlement  on December 23, 2003 and final  judgment of
 dismissal  was entered on December 26, 2003. Payments  to class  counsel  and  eligible
 claimants  were  made in the first  quarter  of 2004.  We have  previously provided for
the costs of this settlement as  AmeriServe and other charges (credits).

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp.,  entitled

Wrench LLC, Joseph
Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

was filed in the United States  District
Court for the Western  District of Michigan.  The lawsuit  alleged that Taco Bell Corp.
 misappropriated  certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising  featuring a
Chihuahua.  The plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several theories,
 including breach of  implied-in-fact  contract, idea  misappropriation,  conversion  and
unfair  competition.  On June 10, 1999,  the District  Court granted  summary judgment
 in favor of Taco  Bell  Corp.  Plaintiffs  filed an  appeal  with the U.S.  Court of
 Appeals  for the Sixth Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”),  and oral  arguments  were held
on September 20, 2000. On July 6, 2001, the Court of Appeals  reversed  the  District
 Court's  judgment in favor of Taco Bell Corp.  and remanded the case to the District
Court.  Taco Bell Corp.  unsuccessfully  petitioned  the Court of Appeals for rehearing
en banc,  and its petition for writ of  certiorari  to the United  States  Supreme  Court
was denied on January 21,  2002.  The case was  returned to District  Court  for trial
 which  began on May 14,  2003 and on June 4,  2003 the jury  awarded  $30  million  to
the plaintiffs.  Subsequently,  the  plaintiffs'  moved to  amend  the  judgment  to
 include  pre-judgment  interest  and post-judgment  interest and Taco Bell filed its
post-trial  motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.  On September  9,
2003,  the  District  Court denied Taco Bell's  motion and granted the  plaintiff's
 motion to amend the judgment.

In view of the jury verdict and  subsequent  District  Court  ruling,  we recorded a
charge of $42 million in 2003. We continue to believe that the Wrench  plaintiffs'  claims
are without  merit and have appealed the verdict to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
 Post-judgment interest will continue to accrue during the appeal process.

On July 9, 2003 we filed suit against Taco Bell's former  advertising  agency in the
United States  District Court for the Central District of California  seeking
 reimbursement for any final award that may be ultimately  affirmed by the appeals courts
and costs that we have incurred in defending this matter.  We are also seeking
 reimbursement  from our insurance carriers.

Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off

In  connection  with the  Spin-off,  we  entered  into  separation  and  other
 related  agreements  (the  “Separation Agreements”)  governing the Spin-off and our
subsequent  relationship with PepsiCo.  These agreements  provide certain indemnities to
PepsiCo.

Under terms of the  agreement,  we have  indemnified  PepsiCo  for any costs or losses
it incurs  with  respect to all letters of credit,  guarantees  and contingent
 liabilities  relating to our  businesses  under which PepsiCo  remains liable.  As of
December 27, 2003,  PepsiCo remains liable for  approximately $82 million on a nominal
basis related to these


contingencies.  This  obligation  ends at the time PepsiCo is
released,  terminated  or replaced by a qualified letter of credit.  We have not been
required to make any payments under this indemnity.

Included in the  indemnities  described  above are  contingent  liabilities  on lease
 agreements of certain  non-core businesses of PepsiCo which were sold prior to the
Spinoff.  Two of these  businesses,  Chevys Mexican  Restaurant and Hot 'n Now  filed
 for  bankruptcy  protection  in  October  2003 and  January  2004,  respectively.  While
we  cannot presently  determine our  liability  under these  indemnities,  if any, we do
not expect the amount to have a material impact on our  Consolidated  Financial
 Statements.  Any related  expenses  will be recorded as  AmeriServe  and other charges
(credits) in our Consolidated Income Statement.

Under the Separation  Agreements,  PepsiCo maintains full control and absolute
 discretion with regard to any combined or  consolidated  tax filings for periods
 through  October 6, 1997.  PepsiCo also maintains full control and absolute discretion
 regarding any common tax audit issues.  Although PepsiCo has  contractually  agreed to,
in good faith, use its best efforts to settle all joint  interests in any common audit
issue on a basis  consistent  with prior practice, there can be no assurance that
 determinations  made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach, acting on our own
behalf.  Through  December  27,  2003,  there have not been any  determinations  made by
 PepsiCo  where we would have reached a different determination.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

We are responsible for the  preparation,  integrity and fair  presentation of the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements, related  notes and other  information  included in
this annual  report.  The  financial  statements  were  prepared in accordance with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America and include
certain amounts based upon our estimates and  assumptions,  as required.  Other financial
 information  presented in the annual report is derived from the financial statements.

We maintain a system of internal  control over financial  reporting,  designed to
provide  reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial  statements,  as
well as to safeguard  assets from  unauthorized  use or disposition. The system is
supported by formal  policies and procedures,  including an active Code of Conduct
 program  intended to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest  standards  of personal
 and  professional  integrity.  Our  internal  audit function  monitors and reports on
the adequacy of and compliance  with the internal  control  system,  and appropriate
actions are taken to address  significant  control  deficiencies and other  opportunities
 for improving the system as they are identified.

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements have been audited and reported on by our
independent  auditors,  KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial  records
and related data,  including  minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and
Committees of the Board. We believe that  management  representations  made to the
independent  auditors were valid and appropriate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,  which is composed solely of outside
 directors,  provides oversight to our financial  reporting  process and our controls to
safeguard assets through periodic  meetings with our independent auditors,  internal
auditors and management.  Both our independent  auditors and internal auditors have free
access to the Audit Committee.

Although no  cost-effective  internal  control  system will  preclude  all errors and
 irregularities,  we believe our controls as of December 27, 2003 provide reasonable
assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors

YUM! Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of YUM! Brands,  Inc.
and  Subsidiaries  (“YUM”) as of December  27,  2003 and  December  28,  2002,  and the
 related  consolidated  statements  of  income,  cash flows and shareholders'  equity
 (deficit)  and  comprehensive  income  for each of the  years in the  three-year  period
 ended December  27,  2003.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are the
 responsibility  of  YUM's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted
in the United States of America. Those  standards  require  that we plan and  perform
 the audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial  statements
 are free of material  misstatement.  An audit  includes  examining,  on a test basis,
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes  assessing the accounting principles used and significant  estimates made
by management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial  statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects, the financial  position of YUM as of December 27, 2003
and December 28, 2002,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended December 27, 2003, in conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated  financial statements,  YUM adopted
the provisions of the Financial Accounting  Standards  Board's  Statement of Financial
 Accounting  Standards No. 142,  “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in 2002.

2.

Based
on my  knowledge,  this report does not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact
or omit to state a      material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of
the  circumstances  under which such statements were      made, not misleading with
respect to the period covered by this report;

3.

Based
on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and other  financial  information

The
 registrant's  other certifying  officer and I are responsible for  establishing  and
maintaining  disclosure      controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules

(a)

designed
 such  disclosure  controls and  procedures,  or caused such  disclosure  controls and
 procedures to be      designed  under our  supervision,  to ensure that  material
 information  relating to the  registrant,  including its      consolidated
 subsidiaries,  is made known to us by others within those entities,  particularly
 during the period in      which this report is being prepared;

(b)

evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls and procedures and presented
in this report      our  conclusions  about the  effectiveness  of the disclosure
 controls and  procedures,  as of the end of the period      covered by this report based
on such evaluation; and

(c)

disclosed
in this report any change in the registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting
that occurred      during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the  registrant's
 fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual      report) that has  materially
 affected,  or is reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
     control over financial reporting; and

5.

The
registrant's other certifying  officer and I have disclosed,  based on our most recent
evaluation of internal      control over financial reporting,  to the registrant's
 auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of      directors (or persons
performing the equivalent function):

(a)

all
 significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the design or  operation  of
internal  control over      financial  reporting which are reasonably  likely to
adversely  affect the registrant's  ability to record,  process,      summarize and
report financial information; and

(b)

any
fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or other employees who have a
significant role in      the registrant's internal controls over financial reporting.
