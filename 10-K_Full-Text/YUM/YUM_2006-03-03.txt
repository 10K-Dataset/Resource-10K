Item 1.

Business

.

YUM! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in 1997. The principal executive offices of YUM are located at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky  40213, and the telephone number at that location is (502) 874-8300.

YUM, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the Company. The terms “we,” “us” and “our” are also used in the Form 10-K to refer to the Company.

This Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statements on page 52.

(a)

General Development of Business

In January 1997, PepsiCo announced its decision to spin-off its restaurant businesses to shareholders as an independent public company (the “Spin-off”). Effective October 6, 1997, PepsiCo disposed of its restaurant businesses by distributing all of the outstanding shares of common stock of YUM to its shareholders.

On May 7, 2002, YUM completed the acquisition of Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (“YGR”), the parent company and operator of Long John Silver’s (“LJS”) and A&W All-American Food Restaurants (“A&W”). Additionally, on May 16, 2002, following receipt of shareholder approval, the Company changed its name from TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. to YUM! Brands, Inc.

Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably.

(b)

Financial Information about Operating Segments

YUM consists of six operating segments:  KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS/A&W, YUM Restaurants International (“YRI” or “International Division”) and YUM Restaurants China (“China Division”). For financial reporting purposes, management considers the four U.S. operating segments to be similar and, therefore, has aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment. In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division includes mainland China (“China”), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations.

Operating segment information for the years ended December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 for the Company is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) in Part II, Item 7, pages 25 through 52 and in the related Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 53 through 96.

Narrative Description of Business

General

YUM is the world’s largest quick service restaurant (“QSR”) company based on number of system units, with over 34,000 units in more than 100 countries and territories. Through the five concepts of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS, and A&W (the “Concepts”), the Company develops, operates, franchises and licenses a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items. In all five of its Concepts, the Company either operates units or they are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one unit to large publicly traded companies. In


addition, the Company owns non-controlling interests in Unconsolidated Affiliates who operate similar to franchisees. As of year-end 2005, approximately 22 percent of YUM’s worldwide units were operated by the Company, approximately 66 percent by franchisees, approximately 7 percent by licensees and approximately 5 percent by Unconsolidated Affiliates.

At year-end 2005, we had over 20,000 system units, including over 3,000 multi-branded units, in the U.S. which generated revenues of $5.9 billion and operating profit of $760 million during 2005.  As of year-end 2005, approximately 23 percent of U.S. units were operated by the Company, approximately 66 percent by franchisees and approximately 11 percent by licensees.

The International Division, based in Dallas, Texas, comprises over 11,000 restaurants, primarily KFCs and Pizza Huts, operating in over 100 countries outside the U.S.  In 2005, YRI achieved revenues of $2.1 billion and operating profit of $372 million.  As of year-end 2005, approximately 12 percent of International Division units were operated by the Company, approximately 77 percent by franchisees, approximately 2 percent by licensees and approximately 9 percent by Unconsolidated Affiliates.  In 2005, YRI opened more than 700 new restaurants for the sixth straight year.

The China Division, based in Shanghai, China, has been reported separately since the beginning of 2005. The China Division has more than 2,200 system restaurants, predominately KFCs.  In 2005, the China Division achieved revenues of nearly $1.3 billion and operating profit of $211 million.  As of year-end 2005, approximately 67 percent of China Division units were operated by the Company, approximately 9 percent by franchisees and approximately 24 percent by Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Restaurant Concepts

In each Concept, consumers can dine in and/or carry out food. In addition, Taco Bell, KFC, LJS and A&W offer a drive-thru option in many stores. Pizza Hut offers a drive-thru option on a much more limited basis. Pizza Hut and, on a much more limited basis, KFC offer delivery service.

Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices.

The franchise program of the Company is designed to assure consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises. Under the standard franchise agreement, franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to YUM, purchasing or leasing the land, building and equipment and purchasing signs, seating, inventories and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business. Franchisees then contribute to the Company’s revenues through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales.

The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on all aspects of the business, including new products, equipment and management techniques.

The Company is actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding, primarily in the U.S., where two or more of its Concepts are operated in a single unit. By combining two or more restaurant concepts, particularly those that have complementary daypart strengths in one location, the Company believes it can generate higher sales volumes from such units, significantly improve returns on per unit investment, and enhance its ability to penetrate a greater number of trade areas throughout the U.S. Through market planning initiatives encompassing all of its Concepts, the Company has established, and annually updates, multi-year development plans by trade area to optimize franchise and company penetration of its Concepts and to improve returns on its existing asset base. The development of multibranded units may be limited, in some instances, by prior development and/or territory rights granted to franchisees.


At year-end 2005, there were 3,289 multibranded units in the worldwide system. These units were comprised of 2,548 units offering food products from two of the Concepts (a “2n1”), 48 units offering food products from three of the Concepts (a “3n1”), and 669 units offering food products from Pizza Hut and WingStreet, a flavored chicken wings concept.  YUM has developed 24 units offering food products from KFC and Wing Works, another flavored chicken wings concept developed by YUM.

Following is a brief description of each concept:

KFC

•

KFC was founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders, an early developer of the quick service food business and a pioneer of the restaurant franchise concept. The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. KFC is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

•

As of year-end 2005, KFC was the leader in the U.S. chicken QSR segment among companies featuring chicken-on-the-bone as their primary product offering, with a 47 percent market share (Source: The NPD Group, Inc.; NPD Foodworld; CREST) in that segment which is nearly four times that of its closest national competitor.

•

KFC operates in 96 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year-end 2005, KFC had 5,443 units in the U.S., and 8,288 units outside the U.S. Approximately 21 percent of the U.S. units and 24 percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

•

Traditional KFC restaurants in the U.S. offer fried chicken-on-the-bone products, primarily marketed under the names Original Recipe and Extra Tasty Crispy. Other principal entree items include chicken sandwiches (including the Snacker and the Twister), Colonel’s Crispy Strips, Wings, Popcorn Chicken and, seasonally, Chunky Chicken Pot Pies. KFC restaurants in the U.S. also offer a variety of side items, such as biscuits, mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, corn, and potato wedges, as well as desserts. While many of these products are offered outside of the U.S., international menus are more focused on chicken sandwiches and Colonel’s Crispy Strips, and include side items that are suited to local preferences and tastes. Restaurant decor throughout the world is characterized by the image of the Colonel.

Pizza Hut

•

The first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened. Today, Pizza Hut is the largest restaurant chain in the world specializing in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products. Pizza Hut is based in Dallas, Texas.

•

As of year-end 2005, Pizza Hut was the leader in the U.S. pizza QSR segment, with a 15 percent market share (Source: The NPD Group, Inc.; NPD Foodworld; CREST) in that segment.

•

Pizza Hut operates in 91 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year-end 2005, Pizza Hut had 7,566 units in the U.S., and 5,006 units outside of the U.S. Approximately 22 percent of the U.S. units and 18 percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

•

Pizza Hut features a variety of pizzas, which may include Pan Pizza, Thin ‘n Crispy, Hand Tossed, Sicilian, Stuffed Crust, Twisted Crust, The Big New Yorker, The Insider, The Chicago Dish and 4forALL. Each of these pizzas is offered with a variety of different toppings. In some restaurants, Pizza Hut also offers breadsticks, pasta, salads and sandwiches. Menu items outside of the U.S. are generally similar to those offered in the U.S., though pizza toppings are often suited to local preferences and tastes.


Taco Bell

•

The first Taco Bell restaurant was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California, and in 1964, the first Taco Bell franchise was sold. Taco Bell is based in Irvine, California.

•

As of year-end 2005, Taco Bell was the leader in the U.S. Mexican QSR segment, with a 60 percent market share (Source: The NPD Group, Inc.; NPD Foodworld; CREST) in that segment.

•

Taco Bell operates in 14 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year-end 2005, there were 5,845 Taco Bell units in the U.S., and 245 units outside of the U.S. Approximately 21 percent of the U.S. units and 1 percent of the non-U.S. units are operated by the Company.

•

Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products, including various types of tacos, burritos, gorditas, chalupas, quesadillas, salads, nachos and other related items. Additionally, proprietary entrée items include Grilled Stuft Burritos and Border Bowls.  Taco Bell units feature a distinctive bell logo on their signage.

LJS

•

The first LJS restaurant opened in 1969 and the first LJS franchise unit opened later the same year. LJS is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

•

As of year-end 2005, LJS was the leader in the U.S. seafood QSR segment, with a 33 percent market share (Source: The NPD Group, Inc.; NPD Foodworld; CREST)  in that segment.

•

LJS operates in 6 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year-end 2005, there were 1,169 LJS units in the U.S., and 34 units outside the U.S. Approximately 52 percent of the U.S. units are operated by the Company. All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees or licensees.

•

LJS features a variety of seafood items, including meals featuring batter-dipped fish, chicken, shrimp, hushpuppies and portable snack items. LJS units typically feature a distinctive seaside/nautical theme.

A&W

•

A&W was founded in Lodi, California by Roy Allen in 1919 and the first A&W franchise unit opened in 1925. A&W is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

•

A&W operates in 11 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year-end 2005, there were 449 A&W units in the U.S., and 229 units outside the U.S. Approximately 3 percent of the U.S. units are operated by the Company. All non-U.S. units are operated by franchisees or licensees.

•

A&W serves A&W draft Root Beer and a signature A&W Root Beer float, as well as hot dogs and all-American pure-beef hamburgers.

Restaurant Operations

Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates, franchises and licenses a worldwide system of both traditional and non-traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery services. Non-traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.


The Company’s restaurant management structure varies by concept and unit size. Generally, each Company restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager (“RGM”), together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In the U.S., the average restaurant has 25 to 30 employees, while internationally this figure can be significantly higher depending on the location and sales volume of the restaurant. Most of the employees work on a part-time basis. We issue detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs, covering all aspects of restaurant operations, including food handling and product preparation procedures, safety and quality issues, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each
unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards.
CHAMPS – which stands for Cleanliness, Hospitality,
Accuracy, Maintenance, Product Quality and Speed of Service
– is our core systemwide program for training,
measuring and rewarding employee performance against key
customer measures. CHAMPS is intended to align the operating
processes of our entire system around one set of standards.
RGMs’ efforts, including CHAMPS performance measures,
are monitored by Area Coaches. Area Coaches typically work
with approximately six to twelve restaurants. The
Company’s restaurants are visited from time to time by
various senior operators who help ensure adherence to system
standards and mentor restaurant team members.

RGMs attend and complete their respective Concepts’ required training programs. These programs consist of initial training, as well as additional continuing development and training programs that may be offered or required from time to time. Initial manager training programs generally last at least six weeks and emphasize leadership, business management, supervisory skills (including training, coaching, and recruiting), product preparation and production, safety, quality control, customer service, labor management, and equipment maintenance.


Supply

and Distribution

The Company is a substantial purchaser of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken products, cheese, beef and pork products, paper and packaging materials, flour, produce, certain beverages, seafood, cooking oils, pinto beans, seasonings and tomato-based products.

The Company, along with the representatives of the Company’s KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS and A&W franchisee groups, are members in the Unified FoodService Purchasing Co-op, LLC (the “Unified Co-op”) which was created for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the U.S. The core mission of the Unified Co-op is to provide the lowest possible sustainable store-delivered prices for restaurant products and equipment. This arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company and franchisee restaurants in the U.S. which the Company believes will further leverage the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function. The Company also believes that the Unified Co-op has resulted, and should continue to result, in closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community.

The Company is committed to conducting its business in an ethical, legal and socially responsible manner. To encourage compliance with all legal requirements and ethical business practices, YUM has a supplier code of conduct for all U.S. suppliers to our business. To ensure the wholesomeness of food products, suppliers are required to meet or exceed strict quality control standards. Long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are used to ensure availability of products. The Company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for these supplies are subject to fluctuation. When prices increase, the Company may be able to pass on such increases to its customers, although there is no assurance this can be done in the future.

Most food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in the operation of the Company’s restaurants are distributed to individual restaurant units by third party distribution companies.  Since November 30, 2000, McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) has been the exclusive distributor for Company-operated KFCs, Pizza Huts and Taco Bells in the U.S. and for a substantial number of franchisee and licensee stores.  McLane became the distributor when it assumed all supply and distribution responsibilities under an existing agreement between AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc. (“AmeriServe”) and the Company (the “AmeriServe Agreement”).  McLane acquired AmeriServe after AmeriServe emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 28, 2000.  A discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process on the Company is contained in Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The terms of the
AmeriServe agreement with the Company extend through October
31, 2010 and generally prohibit KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
restaurants from using alternative distributors in the U.S.
The Company stores within the LJS system are covered under a
separate agreement with McLane.

The International and China Divisions and their franchisees use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional, and local suppliers and distributors. In certain countries, the International Division owns all or a portion of the distribution system.  The China Division also owns all of the distribution system in mainland China, while the distribution systems for KFC Taiwan and Thailand are dependent on third-parties.

Trademarks and Patents

The Company and its Concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks. The Company believes that many of these marks, including its Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®, Pizza Hut®, Taco Bell® and Long John Silver’s® marks, have significant value and are materially important to its business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks. The Company also licenses certain A&W trademarks and service marks (the “A&W Marks”), which are owned by A&W Concentrate Company (formerly A&W Brands, Inc.). A&W Concentrate Company, which is not affiliated with the Company, has granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Canada), perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use the A&W Marks for restaurant services.


The use of these marks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS and A&W franchise and license agreements. Under current law and with proper use, the Company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely. The Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while valuable, are not material to its business.

Working Capital

Information about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7, pages 25 through 52 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8, page 57.

Customers

The Company’s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers.

Seasonal Operations

The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.

Backlog Orders

Company restaurants have no backlog orders.

Government Contracts

No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.

Competition

The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, location and concept. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Each of the Concepts compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. In 2005, the restaurant business in the U.S. consisted of
about 900,000 restaurants representing approximately $476
billion in annual sales. The Company’s Concepts
accounted for about 2% of those restaurants and about 4% of
those sales. There is currently no way to reasonably
estimate the size of the competitive market outside the U.S.

Research and Development (“R&D”)

The Company operates R&D facilities in Louisville, Kentucky; Dallas, Texas; and Irvine, California and in several locations outside the U.S. The Company expensed $33 million in 2005 and $26 million in both 2004 and 2003, for R&D activities. From time to time, independent suppliers also conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the YUM system.


Environmental Matters

The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2005, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.

Government Regulation

U.S

.

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting its business. Each of the Company’s restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. In addition, the Company must comply with various state laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship. To date, the Company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

A small portion of Pizza Hut’s and LJS’s sales are attributable to the sale of beer and wine. A license is required in most cases for each site that sells alcoholic beverages (in most cases, on an annual basis) and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages relate to many aspects of restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

The Company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices, overtime, tip credits and working conditions. The bulk of the Company’s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages.

The Company is also subject to federal and state child labor laws which, among other things, prohibit the use of certain “hazardous equipment” by employees 18 years of age or younger. The Company has not to date been materially adversely affected by such laws.

The Company continues to monitor its facilities for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) in order to conform to its requirements. Under the ADA, the Company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to, or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of, disabled persons. We believe that expenditures, if required, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

International

and China Divisions

. The Company’s restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting the Company’s U.S. restaurants, including laws and regulations concerning labor, health, sanitation and safety. The international restaurants are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment. International compliance with environmental requirements has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.

Employees

As of year-end 2005, the Company employed over 272,000 persons, approximately 78 percent of whom were part-time. Approximately 46 percent of the Company’s employees are employed in the U.S. The Company believes that it provides working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of its principal competitors. Most Company employees are paid on an hourly basis. Some of the Company’s non-U.S. employees are subject to labor council relationships that vary due to the diverse cultures in which the Company operates. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

We face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry, including operational, legal, regulatory and product risks.  The following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business and our results of operations.  Other factors may exist that the Company cannot anticipate or that the Company does not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available.

Health concerns arising from outbreaks of Avian Flu may have an adverse effect on our business.

In 2004 and 2005, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of Avian Flu, and some commentators have hypothesized that further outbreaks could occur and reach pandemic levels.  While fully-cooked chicken has been determined to be safe for consumption, and while the Company has taken and continues to take measures to anticipate and minimize the effect of these outbreaks on our business, any further outbreaks could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and cause customers to shift their preferences. In addition, outbreaks on a widespread basis could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees.

Food safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.

The Company considers food safety a top priority and dedicates substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food-borne illnesses (such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and food safety issues have occurred in the past, and could occur in the future. If such instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues were to occur, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, negative publicity could result which could adversely affect sales and profitability.  If our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants.  Additionally, the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients. Finally, like other companies in the restaurant industry, some of our products may contain genetically
engineered food products; increased regulation of and
opposition to genetically engineered food products have on
occasion and may in the future force us to use alternative
sources at increased costs.

Our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.

Our restaurants are operated in numerous countries and territories and our foreign business is significant.  We intend to further expand our international operations over the next several years.  As a result, our business and operations are


subject to the risk of changes in economic conditions, tax systems, consumer preferences, social conditions and political conditions inherent in foreign operations, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated, as well as changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.  In addition, our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Mainland China is one of our fastest developing markets.  Any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.-China relations could adversely affect our China business.  Our growing investments in our China operations will increase our exposure in this market.  Many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government.  China’s government regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. Although management believes it has structured our China operations to comply with local laws, there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. If we were unable to enforce our intellectual property and contract rights in China, our business would be adversely impacted.

Changes in commodity and other operating costs or supply chain and business disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations.

While the Company takes measures to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs, any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as beef, chicken, cheese and produce, among others, could adversely affect our operating results.  Although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results, we remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls, labor disputes and government regulations.  In addition to food, we purchase electricity, oil and natural gas needed to operate our restaurants, and suppliers purchase gasoline needed to transport food and supplies to us.  Any significant increase in energy costs could adversely affect our business through higher rates and the
imposition of fuel surcharges by our suppliers.  Because we
provide moderately priced food, we may choose not to, or be
unable to, pass along commodity price increases to our
customers.  Additionally, significant increases in gasoline
prices could result in a decrease of customer traffic at our
restaurants.  We rely on third party distribution companies
to deliver food and supplies to our stores. Interruption of
distribution services due to financial distress or other
issues could impact our operations. Our operating costs also
include premiums that we pay for our insurance (including
workers’ compensation, general liability, property and
health) which may increase over time, thereby further
increasing our costs.  Finally, our industry is susceptible
to natural disasters which could result in restaurant
closures and business disruptions.

Our operating results are closely tied to the success of our Concepts’ franchisees.

As a result of our franchising programs, our operating results are dependent upon the sales volumes and viability of our franchisees. Any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results.  Franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the restaurants contemplated by their franchise agreements with us, or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them. In addition, franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites, obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules. Our franchisees generally depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants.  In some instances, financing has been difficult to obtain for some operators. Any of these
problems could slow our planned growth.

We could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies.

As a restaurant industry participant, we are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or


whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment for significant monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results.

In addition, the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products, as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some guests. We may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and, even if we are not, publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick service and fast-casual segments of the industry) may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results.

Changes in governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations.

We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. Each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies.  Requirements of local authorities with respect to zoning, land use, licensing, permitting and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.

We are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. The expenses associated with any facilities modifications required by these laws could be material. Our operations are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters. The compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial.

We may not attain our target development goals.

We are pursuing a disciplined growth strategy, which, to be successful, will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to upgrade existing restaurants and open new restaurants, and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis.  We cannot guarantee that we, or our franchisees, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new, upgraded or converted restaurants will be operated profitably.  Further, there is no assurance that any restaurant we open or convert will obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants.  The success of our planned expansion, including our multibranding initiatives, will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive.

The restaurant industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, and attractiveness and maintenance of properties. If our restaurants and franchised restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurants in new and existing markets, our business could be adversely affected. In the restaurant industry, labor is a primary operating cost component. Competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees.  In addition, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest
traffic or impose practical limits on pricing, either of
which could harm our results of operations.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

The Company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2005 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.


Item 2.

Properties

.

As of year-end 2005, the Company owned over 2,000 units and leased land, building or both in over 5,500 units worldwide. These units are further detailed as follows:

•

The U.S. owned over 1,700 units and leased land, building or both in over 2,900 units,

•

The International Division owned over 200 units and leased land, building or both in over 1,000 units, and

•

The China Division leased land, building or both in over 1,500 units.

Company restaurants in the U.S. which are not owned are generally leased for initial terms of 15 or 20 years and generally have renewal options; however, Pizza Hut delivery/carryout units in the U.S. generally are leased for significantly shorter initial terms with short renewal options.  Company restaurants in the International Division which are not owned have initial lease terms and renewal options that vary by country.  Company restaurants in the China Division which are not owned are generally leased for initial terms of 10 to 15 years and generally do not have renewal options. The Company generally does not lease or sub-lease units that it owns or leases to franchisees.

Pizza Hut and YRI lease their corporate headquarters and a research facility in Dallas, Texas. Taco Bell leases its corporate headquarters and research facility in Irvine, California. KFC owns its and LJS’s, A&W’s and YUM’s corporate headquarters and a research facility in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition, YUM leases office facilities for certain support groups in Louisville, Kentucky. The China Division leases their corporate headquarters in Shanghai, China. Additional information about the Company’s properties is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes in Part II, Item 8, pages 53 through 96.

The Company believes that its properties are generally in good operating condition and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.


Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

.

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, real estate, environmental and other matters arising in the normal course of business. The following is a brief description of the more significant of these categories of lawsuits and other matters. Except as stated below, the Company believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already provided for these matters in the Consolidated Financial Statements, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Franchising

A substantial number of the restaurants of each of the Concepts are franchised to independent businesses operating under arrangements with the Concepts. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its Concepts’ franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, without limitation, quality, service, and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants, transfers or terminations of franchises, territorial disputes and delinquent payments.

Suppliers

The Company, through approved distributors, purchases food, paper, equipment and other restaurant supplies from numerous independent suppliers throughout the world. These suppliers are required to meet and maintain compliance with the Company’s standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers on a number of issues, including, but not limited to, compliance with product specifications and terms of procurement and service requirements.

Employees

At any given time, the Company or its affiliates employ hundreds of thousands of persons, primarily in its restaurants. In addition, each year thousands of persons seek employment with the Company and its restaurants. From time to time, disputes arise regarding employee hiring, compensation, termination and promotion practices.

Like other retail employers, the Company has been faced in a few states with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.

On August 13, 2003, a class action lawsuit against Pizza Hut, Inc., entitled

Coldiron v. Pizza Hut, Inc.

, was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California. Plaintiff alleges that she and other current and former Pizza Hut Restaurant General Managers (“RGMs”) were improperly classified as exempt employees under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).  There is also a pendent state law claim, alleging that current and former RGMs in California were misclassified under that state’s law.  Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime wages and penalties.  On May 5, 2004, the District Court granted conditional certification of a nationwide class of RGMs under the FLSA claim, providing notice to prospective class members and an opportunity to join the class.  Approximately 12 percent of the eligible class
members have elected to join the litigation.  However, on
June 30, 2005, the District Court granted Pizza Hut’s
motion to strike all FLSA class members who joined the
litigation after July 15, 2004. The effect of this order is
to reduce the number of FLSA class members to only
approximately 88 (or approximately 2.5% of the eligible
class members).

In November 2005, the parties agreed to a settlement.  Pizza Hut believes that definitive settlement documents will be preliminarily and finally approved by the Court within sixty to ninety days following submission of the documents to the Court.  We have provided for this settlement amount in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

On November 26, 2001, a lawsuit against Long John Silver’s, Inc. (“LJS”) entitled

Kevin Johnson, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. Long John Silver’s, Inc.

(“Johnson”) was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division.  Johnson’s suit alleged that LJS’s former “Security/Restitution for


Losses” policy (the “Policy”) provided for deductions from RGMs and Assistant Restaurant General Managers (“ARGMs”) salaries that violate the salary basis test for exempt personnel under regulations issued pursuant to the FLSA.  Johnson alleged that all RGMs and ARGMs who were employed by LJS for the three year period prior to the lawsuit – i.e., since November 26, 1998 – should be treated as the equivalent of hourly employees and thus were eligible under the FLSA for overtime for any hours worked over 40 during all weeks in the recovery period.  In addition, Johnson claimed that the potential members of the class are entitled to certain liquidated damages and attorney’s fees under the FLSA.

LJS believed that Johnson’s claims, as well as the claims of all other similarly situated parties, should be resolved in individual arbitrations pursuant to LJS’s Dispute Resolution Program (“DRP”), and that a collective action to resolve these claims in court was clearly inappropriate under the current state of the law.  Accordingly, LJS moved to compel arbitration in the Johnson case.  LJS and Johnson also agreed to stay the action effective December 17, 2001, pending mediation and entered into a tolling agreement for that purpose.  After mediation did not resolve the case, and after limited discovery and a hearing, the Court determined on June 7, 2004, that Johnson’s individual claims should be referred to arbitration.  Johnson appealed, and the decision of the District Court was affirmed in all respects by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on July 5, 2005.

On December 19, 2003, counsel for plaintiff in the above referenced Johnson lawsuit, filed a separate demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on behalf of former LJS managers Erin Cole and Nick Kaufman, who reside in South Carolina (the “Cole Arbitration”).  Claimants in the Cole Arbitration demand a class arbitration on behalf of the same putative class - and the same underlying FLSA claims - as were alleged in the Johnson lawsuit.  The complaint in the Cole Arbitration subsequently was amended to allege a practice of deductions (distinct from the allegations as to the Policy) in violation of the FLSA salary basis test, and to add Victoria McWhorter, another LJS former manager, as an additional claimant.  LJS has denied the claims and the putative class alleged in the Cole Arbitration, and it is LJS’s position that the claims of Cole, Kaufman, and
McWhorter should be individually arbitrated.

Arbitrations under LJS’s DRP, including the Cole Arbitration, are governed by the rules of the AAA.  In October 2003, the AAA adopted its Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (“AAA Class Rules”).  The AAA appointed an arbitrator for the Cole Arbitration.  On June 15, 2004, the arbitrator issued a clause construction award, ruling that the DRP does not preclude class arbitration.  LJS moved to vacate the clause construction award in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.  On September 15, 2005, the federal court in South Carolina ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear LJS’s motion to vacate.  LJS has appealed the U.S. District Court’s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While judicial review of the clause construction award was pending, the arbitrator permitted claimants to move for a class determination
award, which was opposed by LJS.  On September 19, 2005, the
arbitrator issued a class determination award, certifying a
class of LJS’s RGMs and ARGMs employed between December
17, 1998, and August 22, 2004, on FLSA claims, to proceed on
an opt-out basis under the AAA Class Rules. That class
determination award was upheld on appeal by the United
States District Court for the District of South Carolina on
January 20, 2006. LJS has appealed the ruling of the U.S.
District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit.

LJS believes that the DRP provides for individual arbitrations.  LJS also believes that if the Cole Arbitration must proceed on a class basis, (i) the proceedings should be governed by the opt-in collective action structure of the FLSA, (ii) a class should not be certified under the applicable provisions of the FLSA, and (iii) each individual should not be able to recover for more than two years (and a maximum three years) prior to the date they file a consent to join the arbitration.  We have provided for the estimated costs of the Cole Arbitration, based on a projection of eligible claims, the amount of each eligible claim, the estimated legal fees incurred by the claimants and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters.  But in view of the novelties of proceeding under the AAA Class Rules and the inherent
uncertainties of litigation, there can be no assurance that
the outcome of the arbitration will not result in losses in
excess of those currently provided for.

On September 21, 2005, a collective action lawsuit against the Company and KFC Corporation, originally entitled

Parler v. Yum Brands, Inc., d/b/a KFC, and KFC Corporation

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of


Minnesota.  Plaintiff alleges that he and other current and former KFC Assistant Unit Managers (“AUM’s”) were improperly classified as exempt employees under FLSA.  Plaintiff seeks overtime wages and liquidated damages.  On January 17, 2006, the District Court dismissed the claims against the Company with prejudice, leaving KFC Corporation as the sole defendant.  Notice will be mailed to current and former KFC AUM’s advising them of the litigation and providing an opportunity to join the case if they choose to do so.

We believe that KFC has properly classified its AUM’s as exempt under the FLSA and accordingly intend to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit.  However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the outcome of this case cannot be predicted at this time.  Likewise, the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

Customers

The Company’s restaurants serve a large and diverse cross-section of the public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise regarding products, service, accidents and other matters typical of large restaurant systems such as those of the Company.

On December 17, 2002, Taco Bell was named as the defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entitled

Moeller, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

On August 4, 2003, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that alleges, among other things, that Taco Bell has discriminated against the class of people who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility by failing to make its approximately 220 company-owned restaurants in California (the “California Restaurants”) accessible to the class.  Plaintiffs contend that queue rails and other architectural and structural elements of the Taco Bell restaurants relating to the path of travel and use of the facilities by persons with mobility-related disabilities (including parking spaces, ramps, counters, restroom facilities and seating) do not comply with the
U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”),
the Unruh Civil Rights Act (the “Unruh Act”), and
the California Disabled Persons Act (the “CDPA”).
Plaintiffs have requested:  (a) an injunction from the
District Court ordering Taco Bell to comply with the ADA and
its implementing regulations; (b) that the District Court
declare Taco Bell in violation of the ADA, the Unruh Act,
and the CDPA; and (c) monetary relief under the Unruh Act or
CDPA.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of the class, are seeking the
minimum statutory damages per offense of either $4,000 under
the Unruh Act or $1,000 under the CDPA for each aggrieved
member of the class.  Plaintiffs contend that there may be
in excess of 100,000 individuals in the class. For
themselves, the four named plaintiffs have claimed aggregate
minimum statutory damages of no less than $16,000, but are
expected to claim greater amounts based on the number of
Taco Bell outlets they visited at which they claim to have
suffered discrimination.

On February 23, 2004, the District Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  The District Court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) mandatory injunctive relief class of all individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs or electric scooters for mobility who, at any time on or after December 17, 2001, were denied, or are currently being denied, on the basis of disability, the full and equal enjoyment of the California Restaurants.  The class includes claims for injunctive relief and minimum statutory damages.

Pursuant to the parties’ agreement, on or about August 31, 2004, the District Court ordered that the trial of this action be bifurcated so that stage one will resolve Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief and stage two will resolve Plaintiffs’ claims for damages.  The parties are currently proceeding with the equitable relief stage of this action.  During this stage, Taco Bell filed a motion to partially decertify the class to exclude from the Rule 23(b)(2) class claims for monetary damages.  The District Court denied the motion.  Plaintiffs filed their own motion for partial summary judgment as to liability relating to a subset of the California Restaurants.  The District Court denied that motion as well. Discovery is ongoing as of the date of this report.

Taco Bell has denied liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit.  Although this lawsuit is at a relatively early stage in the proceedings, it is likely that certain of the California Restaurants will be determined to be not fully compliant with accessibility laws and that Taco Bell will be required to take certain steps to make those restaurants fully compliant.  However, at this time, it is not possible to estimate with reasonable certainty the potential


costs to bring any non compliant California Restaurants into compliance with applicable state and federal disability access laws.  Nor is it possible at this time to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of liability for monetary damages on a class wide basis to Taco Bell.

Intellectual Property

The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, many of which are of material importance to the Company’s business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of its registered marks.

Other Litigation

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled

Wrench LLC, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Wrench”) was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan.  The lawsuit alleged that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising featuring a Chihuahua.  The plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several theories, including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea misappropriation, conversion and unfair competition.  On June 10, 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Taco Bell Corp.  Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and oral arguments were held on September 20, 2000.  On July 6, 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s judgment in favor
of Taco Bell Corp. and remanded the case to the District
Court.  Taco Bell Corp. unsuccessfully petitioned the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its
petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme
Court was denied on January 21, 2002.  The case was returned
to District Court for trial which began on May 14, 2003 and
on June 4, 2003 the jury awarded $30 million to the
plaintiffs.  Subsequently, the plaintiffs moved to
amend the judgment to include pre-judgment interest and
post-judgment interest and Taco Bell filed its post-trial
motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.  On
September 9, 2003, the District Court denied Taco
Bells’ motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motion
to amend the judgment.

In view of the jury verdict and subsequent District Court ruling, we recorded a charge of $42 million in 2003.  We appealed the verdict to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and interest continued to accrue during the appeal process.  Prior to a ruling from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, we settled this matter with the Wrench plaintiffs on January 15, 2005.  Concurrent with the settlement with the plaintiffs, we also settled the matter with certain of our insurance carriers.  As a result of these settlements, reversals of previously recorded expense of $14 million were recorded in the year ended December 25, 2004.  We paid the settlement amount to the plaintiffs and received the insurance recovery during the first quarter of 2005.  During the third quarter of 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement with another insurance carrier and as a result income of $2 million was recorded in the quarter.

We intend to seek additional recoveries from our other insurance carriers during the periods in question.  We have also filed suit against Taco Bell’s former advertising agency in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement for the settlement amount as well as any costs that we have incurred in defending this matter.  The District Court has issued a minute order granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment but has requested submissions from the defendant for its review before issuing a final order. We believe that a grant by the District Court of this summary judgment motion would be erroneous under the law.  We will evaluate our options once a final order has been issued.  Any additional recoveries will be recorded as they are realized.

Fiscal year 2005 includes 53 weeks and fiscal years 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001 include 52 weeks.


Fiscal year 2005 includes the impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R (Revised 2004), “Share Based Payment,” (“SFAS 123R”).  This resulted in a $38 million decrease in net income, or a decrease of $0.13 to basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005.  If SFAS 123R had been effective for prior years presented, reported basic and diluted earnings per share would have decreased $0.12 and $0.12, $0.12 and $0.12, $0.14 and $0.13, and $0.13 and $0.13 per share for 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, consistent with previously disclosed pro-forma information.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

From May 7, 2002, results include Long John Silver’s (“LJS”) and A&W All-American Food Restaurants (“A&W”), which were added when we acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc.

Fiscal year 2002 includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). As a result we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets beginning December 30, 2001. If SFAS 142 had been effective for 2001, reported net income would have increased $26 million and both basic and diluted earnings per share would have increased $0.09.

The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto.

(e)

Per share and share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed on June 17, 2002.

(f)

All prior years presented have been adjusted for the reclassification of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates from investing activities to operating activities in accordance with SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”  These reclassifications increased net cash provided by operating activities by $55 million, $46 million, $24 million and $19 million for 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

(g)

U.S. Company blended same-store sales growth includes the results of Company owned KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants that have been open one year or more. LJS and A&W are not included.

(h)

International Division and China Division system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the fees are included in the Company’s revenues.  We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development.  Additionally, as previously noted, we
began reporting information for our international business
in two separate operating segments (the International
Division and the China Division) in 2005 as a result of
changes in our management structure.  Segment information
for periods prior to 2005 has been restated to reflect this
reporting.

(i)

Local currency represents the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.


Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction and Overview

YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “YUM” or the “Company”) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silver’s (“LJS”) and A&W All-American Food Restaurants (“A&W”) (collectively “the Concepts”) and is the world’s largest quick service restaurant (“QSR”) company based on the number of system units. LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (“YGR”) on May 7, 2002. YUM is the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. with over 13,800 units. YUM became an independent, publicly-owned company on October 6, 1997 (the “Spin-off Date”) via a tax-free distribution of our Common Stock (the “Distribution” or “Spin-off”) to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”).

Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates, franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non-traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery services. Non-traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.

The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, location and concept. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Each of the Concepts compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.

Our business consists of three reporting segments:  United States, the International Division and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China (“China”), Thailand and KFC Taiwan and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations.

The Company’s key strategies are:

•

Building dominant restaurant brands in China

•

Driving profitable international expansion

•

Improving restaurant operations

•

Multibranding category-leading brands

The Company is focused on five long-term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress. These five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows:

•

China Division and International Division expansion

China Division and International Division system-sales growth (local currency)

Number of new China Division and International Division restaurant openings

Net China Division and International Division unit growth

•

Multibrand innovation and expansion

Number of multibrand restaurant locations

Number of multibrand units added

Number of franchise multibrand units added


•

Portfolio of category-leading U.S. brands

U.S. blended same store sales growth

U.S. system sales growth

•

Global franchise fees

New restaurant openings by franchisees

Franchise fee growth

•

Strong cash generation and returns

Cash generated from all sources

Cash generated from all sources after capital spending

Restaurant margins

Our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

Throughout the MD&A, the Company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 through 59 and the Cautionary Statements on page 52. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 60 through 96. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified.

Factors Affecting Comparability of 2005 Results to 2004 Results and 2004 Results to 2003 Results

International Reporting Changes

In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division includes mainland China (“China”), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation.

Beginning in 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUM’s period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, amounts related to our China business for December 2004 have not been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income and net income of the China business of $6 million for the one month period ending December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment directly to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended December 31, 2005. Our consolidated results of operations for the year to date ended December 31, 2005 include the
results of operations of the China business for the months
of January, 2005 through December, 2005. Our consolidated
results of operations for the years to date ended December
25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 continue to include the
results of operations of the China business for the months
December, 2003 through November, 2004 and December, 2002
through November, 2003, respectively, as previously
reported.


Adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment”

In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), supersedes APB 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”  The provisions of SFAS 123R are similar to those of SFAS 123, however, SFAS 123R requires all new, modified and unvested share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant.  Compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective application transition method effective September 4, 2005, the beginning of our fourth quarter.  As permitted by SFAS 123R, we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (our fiscal year 2005). As such, the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 are required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of SFAS 123.  However, years prior to 2005 have not been restated.

The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the reduction of operating profit of $58 million ($10 million in payroll and employee benefits and $48 million in general and administrative expense), a reduction of net income of $38 million (net of tax benefits of $20 million), a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.13 per share, a reduction of $87 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $87 million in cash flows from financing activities.

The following table shows the 2005 quarterly after-tax effect of adoption of SFAS 123R on the previously reported first three quarters of 2005.

Prior to 2005, all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and its related Interpretations. Accordingly, no stock-based employee compensation expense was reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock options, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  Had the Company applied the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 to stock options in 2004 and 2003, net income of $740 million and $617 million, respectively, would have been reduced by $37 million and $38 million, respectively, to $703 million and $579 million, respectively.  Additionally, both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased $0.12 per share for both 2004 and 2003.


Extra Week in 2005

Our fiscal calendar results in a 53

rd

week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 includes a 53

rd

week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our U.S. businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis.  In the U.S., we permanently accelerated the timing of the KFC business closing by one week in December 2005, and thus, there was no 53

rd

week benefit for this business.  Additionally, all China Division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53

rd

week.

Mainland China Issues

Our KFC business in mainland China was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late March, 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to Avian Flu in the fourth quarter of 2005.  As a result of the aforementioned issues, the China Division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11% excluding foreign currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 22%.  During the year to date ended December 31, 2005, we entered into an agreement for a partial recovery of our losses related to the supplier ingredient issue with the supplier.  As a result of the agreement, we recognized approximately $24 million in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Sale of an Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate

During the second quarter of 2005, we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity, principally for cash. Concurrent with the sale, our former partner completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity. Prior to the sale, we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method. Subsequent to the IPO, the new publicly held entity, in which YUM has no ownership interest, is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest.

This transaction generated a one-time gain of approximately $11 million for YUM as cash proceeds (net of expenses) of approximately $25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate. As with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the approximate $11 million gain was recorded in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2005 nor is it expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations going forward.


Hurricane Katrina

During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to several company and franchised stores. This storm resulted in approximately $4 million of one-time costs being recorded in the full year from property damage and asset write-offs related to company restaurants.  Additionally, during mid-September 2005, Hurricane Rita caused further damage to company and franchised stores, though to a lesser extent than Hurricane Katrina.  We estimate that lost operating profits in 2005 as a result of stores being closed due to the effects of these hurricanes was approximately $3 million.  We do not expect insurance recoveries, if any, related to the hurricanes to be significant.

In the fourth quarter, we experienced utility costs in the U.S. that were approximately $10 million higher than in the prior year, which we believe were at least partially attributable to these hurricanes.  We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of 2006 with year-over-year utility inflation of approximately 20 percent or approximately $7 million.

Sale of Puerto Rico Business

Our Puerto Rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on October 4, 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value. Company sales and restaurant profit decreased $159 million and $29 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $10 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 25, 2004.  Company sales and restaurant profit decreased $27 million and $4 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $1 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $1 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 27, 2003.

Income Tax Impact of Repatriating Qualified Foreign Earnings

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”), which became law on October 22, 2004, allows a dividends received deduction of 85% of repatriated qualified foreign earnings in fiscal year 2005. We recorded $6 million in income tax expense during the year ended December 25, 2004 as a result of our then determination to repatriate approximately $110 million in 2005 which will be eligible for the Act’s dividends received deduction. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” we continued to evaluate in 2005 whether we would repatriate other undistributed earnings from foreign investments as a result of the Act. During the second quarter of 2005, we determined that we would repatriate additional qualified foreign earnings of approximately $390
million in fiscal year 2005 which will be eligible for the
Act’s dividends received deduction (for a total
repatriation of qualified earnings of approximately $500
million). As a result of this determination, approximately
$20 million of additional tax expense was recognized in
fiscal 2005. No additional amounts beyond the approximately
$500 million as discussed above are eligible for the
Act’s dividends received deduction.

Lease Accounting Adjustments

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we were recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight-line basis.

The cumulative adjustment, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately $3 million. As the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements, the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements.


Amendment of Sale-Leaseback Agreements

On August 15, 2003 we amended two sale-leaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR such that the agreements now qualify for sale-leaseback accounting.  Restaurant profit  decreased by $5 million in 2004 versus 2003 as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment.  The decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense.

Canada Unconsolidated Affiliate Dissolution

On November 10, 2003, we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated 733 restaurants in Canada. We owned 50% of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method. Of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, we now operate the vast majority of Pizza Huts and Taco Bells, while almost all KFCs are operated by franchisees. As a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, our Company sales, restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased in 2004 versus 2003.  Additionally, on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the Canadian unconsolidated affiliate in 2003.

As a result of the dissolution of our Canadian unconsolidated affiliate, Company sales increased $147 million, franchise fees decreased $9 million, restaurant profit increased $8 million, general and administrative expenses increased $11 million and other income increased $4 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 compared to the year ended December 27, 2003. The impact on 2004 net income was not significant.

Commodity Inflation

Higher commodity costs, particularly in cheese and meat prices, negatively impacted U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points for the year ended 2004 versus the year ended 2003.

Wrench Litigation

We recorded income of $2 million and $14 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and expense of $42 million in 2003. See Note 4 for a discussion of the Wrench litigation.

AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits)

We recorded income of $2 million, $16 million and $26 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits).

Store Portfolio Strategy

From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and international markets. Such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure.

The following table summarizes our refranchising activities:

In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit (collectively “store closures”). Store closure costs (income) includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a Company restaurant, lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves, and other facility-related expenses from previously closed stores.

The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and general and administrative expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit.

There are no licensed units in the China Division.

Included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows:

System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Company’s revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development.

The increase in Worldwide system sales in 2005 and 2004 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

The increase in U.S. system sales was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures.  In 2004, the increase in U.S. system sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

The increase in International Division system sales in 2005 and 2004 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

In 2005, the increase in China Division system sales was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines driven by the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu.  In 2004, the increase in China Division system sales was primarily driven by new unit development and same store sales growth.

In 2005, U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2004.  The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by higher occupancy and other costs.  Higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increases in utility costs and advertising costs.  A favorable impact from the 53

rd

week (13 basis points) was offset by the unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (17 basis points).

In 2004, the decrease in U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by higher food and paper costs and higher occupancy and other costs, partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin.  Higher food and paper costs were primarily driven by increased commodity costs (principally cheese and meats) and higher occupancy and other costs were primarily driven by increased expense resulting from the adjustment related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements.

In 2005, the decrease in the International Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales included a 51 basis point unfavorable impact of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico.  Also contributing to the decrease were higher occupancy and other costs and higher labor costs.  The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin.  The unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (10 basis points) was largely offset by the favorable impact of the 53

rd

week (8 basis points).

In 2004, International Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2003.  The favorable impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by a 68 basis point unfavorable impact of operating certain restaurants in Canada, which is a market with below average margins, that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate.

In 2005, China Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased.  The decrease was driven by the impact on


restaurant margin of same store sales declines related to the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation.  Also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs.  The decrease was partially offset by the impact on restaurant margin of lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings initiatives).

In 2004, the increase in China Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings initiatives) and same store sales growth on restaurant margin.  The increase was partially offset by higher labor costs and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation.

Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased $102 million or 10% in 2005, including a 4% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, a 1% unfavorable impact from the 53

rd

week and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.  Excluding the unfavorable impact of these factors, general and administrative expenses increased $38 million or 4%.  The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets and higher litigation related costs including charges of $16 million for the potential resolution of certain legal matters.  Higher charitable contributions and expense associated with discontinuing certain corporate software development projects also contributed to the increase.  Such increases were partially offset by reductions associated with
operating restaurants which were refranchised in 2004
(primarily the Puerto Rico business) and the effect of
lapping certain prior year reserve increases related to
potential development sites and surplus facilities.

General and administrative expenses increased $111 million or 12% in 2004, including a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.  The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including incentive compensation, amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets and pension costs.  Also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and increased reserves related to potential development sites and surplus facilities.  The increase was also partially attributable to expenses of $11 million associated with operating the restaurants we now own in Canada that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses due to the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants.

Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses

Franchise and license expenses increased $7 million or 24% in 2005. The increase was driven by higher franchisee support costs and higher provisions for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables.

Franchise and license expenses decreased $2 million or 8% in 2004.  The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lapping the biennial International franchise convention held in 2003.

Other income increased $25 million or 44% in 2005, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by a $24 million partial financial recovery ($4 million of which was recognized through equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates) from a supplier related to an ingredient issue in mainland China (see Note 7). Other income was also positively impacted in 2005 by a $11 million gain associated with the sale of our investment in our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate.

Other income increased $14 million or 34% in 2004, including a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, principally in China, and the dissolution of our unconsolidated affiliate in Canada which recorded a loss for the year ended December 27, 2003.

Worldwide Facility Actions

We recorded a net loss from facility actions of $19 million, $26 million and $36 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 4 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment.

Unallocated and corporate expenses comprise general and administrative expenses and unallocated facility actions comprise refranchising gains (losses), neither of which are allocated to the U.S., International Division, or China Division segments for performance reporting purposes. Unallocated other income (expense) in 2005 primarily comprises the $11 million gain on the sale of our investment in our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate which we did not allocate to the International Division for performance reporting purposes.

U.S. operating profit decreased $17 million or 2% in 2005.  The decrease was driven by higher facility actions expense and higher general and administrative expense. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs.  A 3% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R was offset by a 3% favorable impact from the 53

rd

week.

In 2004, the decrease in U.S. operating profit was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and meat) and the adjustment recorded related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements, as well as higher general and administrative expenses. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees.

International Division operating profit increased $35 million or 11% in 2005, including a 4% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a 2% favorable impact from the 53

rd

week, and a 4% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Excluding the net favorable impact from these factors, International Division operating profit increased $31 million or 9% in 2005.  The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and


franchise and license fees, the impact of new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit, and lower facility actions expense.  These increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs, higher labor costs and the impact on operating profit of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico.

Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, International Division operating profit increased 12% in 2004.  The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees, new unit development and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs.

China Division operating profit increased $6 million or 3% in 2005.  The increase was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of new unit development and a financial recovery from a supplier.  These increases were partially offset by the impact on restaurant profit of same store sales declines, a decrease in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates, and increased general and administrative expense.  A 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation was offset by a 2% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R.

In 2004, the increase in China Division operating profit was driven by new unit development, the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs.

Interest expense increased $2 million or 2% in 2005.  An increase in our average interest rates was largely offset by a decrease in our bank fees attributable to the upgrade in our credit rating.

Interest expense decreased $40 million or 22% in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our average interest rates primarily attributable to pay-variable interest rate swaps entered into during 2004.  Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the amended YGR sale leaseback agreement and lower International short term borrowings.

Income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately $1 million on the $2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended December 27, 2003 due to the adoption of SFAS 143.

The 2005 effective tax rate decreased 2.1 percentage points to 25.8%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors, including the impact of year over year valuation allowances adjustments as well as the recognition of certain foreign tax credits that we were able to substantiate in 2005.  The decrease was partially offset by the impact of year over year adjustments to reserves and prior years and tax provided on foreign earnings which were repatriated to the U.S. in 2005.

The 2004 effective tax rate decreased 2.3 percentage points to 27.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors, including the reversal of reserves in the current year associated with audits that were settled as well as the effects of certain international tax planning strategies implemented in 2004. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping the benefit in 2003 of amending certain prior U.S. income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years as well as the recognition in 2004 of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not.

Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that we believe may impact our exposure.

Consolidated Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities

was $1,238 million compared to $1,186 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income, including the non-cash impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and lower income tax payments in 2005, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits classified in  financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

In 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,186 million compared to $1,099 million in 2003. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income and a decrease in the amount of voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan compared to 2003, partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2004.

Net cash used in investing activities

was $345 million versus $541 million in 2004. The decrease was driven primarily by lower acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending, the impact of the timing of purchases and sales


of short-term investments, higher proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment versus 2004 and the proceeds from the sale of our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate.

In 2004, net cash used in investing activities was $541 million versus $565 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending compared to 2003, partially offset by the impact of the timing of purchases and sales of short–term investments.

Net cash used in financing activities

was $832 million versus $779 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by higher share repurchases, partially offset by net debt borrowings in 2005 versus net debt repayments in 2004 and the impact of excess tax benefits classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

In 2004, net cash used in financing activities was $779 million versus $475 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by higher share repurchases, higher net debt repayments and the payment of two quarterly dividends, partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last four fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. These cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending, while at the same time reducing our long-term debt balances. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows, our ability to reduce discretionary spending, and our
borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash
requirements in 2006 and beyond.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid cash dividends of $123 million. Additionally, on November 18, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.115 per share of common stock to be distributed on February 3, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 13, 2006. On an annual basis, the Company is targeting an annual payout ratio of 15% to 20% of net income.

Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in September 2009. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2005.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, our unused Credit Facility totaled $809 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $191 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.35% to 1.625% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or 0.00% to 0.20% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly.

Additionally, on November 8, 2005, we executed a five-year revolving credit facility (the “International Credit Facility” or “ICF”) on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries. The total facility amount is $350 million, with separate sublimits for each of the three subsidiaries.  The ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM and by YUM’s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2005.

There were borrowings of $180 million and available credit of $170 million outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2005. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.20% to 1.20% over LIBOR or 0.00% to 0.20% over a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “Canadian Dollar Offered Rate” plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUM’s performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly.

The remainder of our long-term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes.  Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Included in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2005 are $200 million in Senior Unsecured Notes with an April 2006 maturity date. The remaining $1.3 billion in Senior Unsecured Notes comprise the majority of our long-term debt.

We estimate that in 2006 capital spending, including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees, will be approximately $675 million. We also estimate that in 2006 refranchising proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately


$150 million, employee stock options proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately $150 million and sales of property, plant and equipment will be approximately $50 million.

In November 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) to be purchased through November 2006. At December 31, 2005, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to $469 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under the November program.

In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 31, 2005 included:

Excludes a fair value adjustment of $6 million deducted from debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 11.

(b)

These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,500 restaurants. See Note 12.

(c)

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements.

We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan’s funded status. The pension plan’s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets. Based on current funding rules, we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2006, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan’s expected September 30, 2006 funded status. During 2005, we made a $65 million discretionary contribution to our funded plan, none of which represented minimum funding requirements. Our postretirement
plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as
you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4
million in 2005.

Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers’ compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively “property and casualty losses”) as well as employee healthcare and long-term disability claims for which we are self-insured. The majority of our recorded liability for self-insured employee health, long-term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had provided approximately $16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Company’s historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants at December 31, 2005. In support of these guarantees, we posted letters of credit of $4 million. We also provided a standby letter of credit of $18 million, under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $77 million at December 31, 2005.

Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss (gain). New loans added to the loan pools in 2005 were not significant.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi-annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value).

Our semi-annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses.  Our semi-annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants.

If the long-lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi-annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist.

We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. Forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to our semi-


annual test for impairment of our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants. The fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values.  Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries).  Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value.

We have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions.  These include trademark/brand intangible assets for KFC, LJS and A&W.  We believe the value of a trademark/brand is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of the trademark/brand.  We have determined that the KFC trademark/brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized.  Our impairment test for the KFC trademark/brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount.  Anticipated sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the KFC trademark/brand.

In determining the fair value of our reporting units and the KFC trademark/brand, we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth, margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans.  For 2005, there was no impairment of goodwill or the KFC trademark/brand.

We have certain intangible assets, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets, franchise contract rights and favorable operating leases, which are amortized over their expected useful lives.  We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept.  We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate.  We base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term.

Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable.  An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows.  For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets.

Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Lease Guarantees

We reserve a franchisee’s or licensee’s entire receivable balance based upon pre-defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 31, 2005.

We have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily  as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants.  Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS 145”).  We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The fair


value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties.

If payment on the guarantee ever becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees.  At December 31, 2005, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $316 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre-tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 31, 2005. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non-payment under the lease. We believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not
been required to make such payments in significant amounts.

See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations.

See Note 21 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees.

Self-Insured Property and Casualty Losses

We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self-insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self-insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.

See Note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.

Pension Plans

Certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after September 30, 2001 are not eligible to participate. As of our September 30, 2005 measurement date, these plans had a projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) of $815 million, an accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) of $736 million and a fair value of plan assets of $610 million. As a result of the $126 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the ABO at September 30, 2005 and an additional $10 million contribution to the plans made subsequent to the measurement date but prior to December 31, 2005, we have recorded a cumulative $110 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax of $66 million) as of December 31, 2005.

The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 5.75% at September 30, 2005.  This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary.  The basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more high-quality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans.  In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the benefit cash
flows for that year.  Such excesses are assumed to be
reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to
meet the benefit cash flows in a future year.  The weighted
average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to
arrive at an appropriate discount rate.  We also insure that
changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year
are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market
rates.

A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate
would have decreased our PBO by approximately $69 million at
September 30, 2005. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in
this discount rate would have increased our PBO by
approximately $77 million at September 30, 2005.


The pension expense we will record in 2006 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at September 30, 2005. In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $10 million to $66 million in 2006. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $8 million in 2006. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 5.75% at September 30, 2005 would impact our 2006 pension expense by approximately $13 million.

The assumption we make regarding our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense.  Our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the weighted-average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions.  Our expected long-term rate of return was lowered to 8.0% from 8.5% in connection with our September 30, 2005 valuation.  We believe this revision was appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon, including those experienced in calendar year 2005.  This change did not impact our reported pension expense for 2005 but will increase our 2006 expense by approximately $3 million.

The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of $256 million in our plans as of September 30, 2005. For purposes of determining 2005 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $22 million of unrecognized actuarial loss. We will recognize approximately $30 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2006. Given no change to the assumptions at our September 30, 2005 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2006 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline.

See Note 14 for further discussion of our pension and post-retirement plans.

Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves

At December 31, 2005, we have a valuation allowance of $233 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $223 million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.

As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.

See Note 19 for a further discussion of our income taxes.

Stock Option Expense

Compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Our specific weighted-average assumptions for the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 15.  Additionally, under SFAS 123R we are required to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized.

Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions.

In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that it was appropriate to group our stock option grants into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected life and pre-vesting forfeitures.  These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant-level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the “RGM


Plan”) and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans.  Historically, approximately 20% of total options granted have been made under the RGM Plan.

We have traditionally used six years as the expected term of all stock option grants.  In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R and the increasing amount of historical data we now possess with regard to stock option exercise activity, we revaluated our expected term assumptions.  Based on historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior, we determined that the expected life for options granted under the RGM Plan was five years.  For options granted to our above-store executives, we determined that an expected life of six years was appropriate.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R we have traditionally based expected volatility on Company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option.  We are in the process of revaluating expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options.  Options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 were not significant.

Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R we recorded reductions in expense due to pre-vesting forfeitures as they occurred.  In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data.  Based on such data, we believe that approximately 45% of all options granted under the RGM Plan, which typically vest on a cliff-basis after four years, will be forfeited while approximately 19% of options granted to above-store executives, which typically vest 25% per year over four years, will be forfeited.  An insignificant transition adjustment was recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 123R for the difference between actual and estimated forfeitures for the first three quarters of 2005 which we restated under the modified retrospective transition method.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use.

Interest Rate Risk

We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt.

At December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would result, over the following twelve-month period, in a reduction of approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, in income before income taxes.  The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 would decrease approximately $39 million and $51 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 would decrease approximately $59 million and $76 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The combined International Division and China Division operating profits constitute approximately 43% of our operating profit in 2005, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Company’s net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s primary exposures result from our operations in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign


currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, operating profit would have decreased $70 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices.

We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short-term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short-term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Cautionary Statements

From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements include those identified by such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan” and other similar terminology. These “forward-looking statements” reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements. Actual results involve risks and uncertainties, including both those specific to the Company and those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from expectations.  Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements.

Company risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in effective tax rates; potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities; our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores; unexpected disruptions in our supply chain; effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the Company; the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing and advertising and promotional efforts; our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel; the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees; the success of our refranchising strategy; the success of our strategies for international development and operations; volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss
estimates; and adoption of new or changes in accounting
policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated
by standard setting bodies.

Industry risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate, including effects of war and terrorist activities; new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business; new product and concept development by us and/or our food industry competitors; changes in commodity, labor, and other operating costs; changes in competition in the food industry; publicity which may impact our business and/or industry; severe weather conditions; volatility of commodity costs; increases in minimum wage and other operating costs; availability and cost of land and construction; consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the Company and/or our competitors, spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic instability in local markets and
changes in currency exchange and interest rates; and the
impact that any widespread illness or general health concern
may have on our business and/or the economy of the countries
in which we operate.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

YUM! Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“YUM”) as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of YUM’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of YUM as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of YUM’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, YUM adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” and changed its method for accounting for share-based payments.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

YUM! Brands, Inc.:

We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A, that YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“YUM”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). YUM’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assessment that YUM maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Also, in our opinion, YUM maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of YUM as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated March 2, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share data)

Note 1 – Description of Business

YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “YUM” or the “Company”) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and since May 7, 2002, Long John Silver’s (“LJS”) and A&W All-American Food Restaurants (“A&W”) (collectively the “Concepts”), which were added when we acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (“YGR”). YUM is the world’s largest quick service restaurant company based on the number of system units, with over 34,000 units of which approximately 40% are located outside the U.S. in more than 100 countries and territories. YUM was created as an independent, publicly-owned company on October 6, 1997 (the “Spin-off Date”) via a tax-free distribution by our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”), of our Common Stock (the “Distribution” or
“Spin-off”) to its shareholders. References to YUM
throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are made
using the first person notations of “we,”
“us” or “our.”

Through our widely-recognized Concepts, we develop, operate, franchise and license a system of both traditional and non-traditional quick service restaurants. Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices. Our traditional restaurants feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery service. Non-traditional units, which are principally licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations like airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. We are actively pursuing the strategy of multibranding, where two or more of
our Concepts are operated in a single unit. In addition, we
are pursuing the multibrand combination of Pizza Hut and
WingStreet, a flavored chicken wings concept we have
developed.

In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division includes mainland China (“China”), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation.

Beginning in 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUM’s period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, amounts related to our China business for December 2004 have not been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income and net income for the China business for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment directly to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended December 31, 2005. Our consolidated results of operations for the year to date ended December 31, 2005 include the results of
operations of the China business for the months of January,
2005 through December, 2005. Our consolidated results of
operations for the years to date ended December 25, 2004 and
December 27, 2003 continue to include the results of
operations of the China business for the months of December,
2003 through November, 2004, and December, 2002 through
November, 2003, respectively, as previously reported.

For the month of December 2004 the China business had revenues of $79 million and net income of $6 million. As mentioned previously, neither of these amounts is included in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year to date ended December 31, 2005 and the net income figure was credited directly to retained earnings in the first quarter of 2005. Net income for the month of December, 2004 was negatively impacted by costs incurred in preparation of opening a significant number of new stores in early 2005 as well as increased advertising expense, all of which was recorded in December’s results of operations. Additionally, the net increase in cash for the China business in December, 2004 has been presented as a single line item on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year to date ended December


31, 2005. The $34 million net increase in cash was primarily attributable to short-term borrowings for working capital purposes, a majority of which were repaid prior to the end of the China business’ first quarter.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Preparation.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain investments in businesses that operate our Concepts are accounted for by the equity method. Generally, we possess 50% ownership of and 50% voting rights over these affiliates. Our lack of majority voting rights precludes us from controlling these affiliates, and thus we do not consolidate these affiliates. Our share of the net income or loss of those unconsolidated affiliates is included in other (income) expense.

We participate in various advertising cooperatives with our franchisees and licensees. In certain of these cooperatives we possess majority voting rights, and thus control the cooperatives. We report all assets and liabilities of these advertising cooperatives that we consolidate as advertising cooperative assets, restricted and advertising cooperative liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  As the contributions to these cooperatives are designated and segregated for advertising, we act as an agent for the franchisees and licensees with regard to these contributions. Thus, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 45, “Accounting for Franchise Fee Revenue,” we do not reflect, and have not reflected in the past, franchisee and licensee contributions to these cooperatives in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In 2004, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46R”). FIN 46R addresses the consolidation of an entity whose equity holders either (a) have not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or (b) do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46R requires the consolidation of such an entity, known as a variable interest entity (“VIE”), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual returns, or both. FIN 46R excludes from its scope businesses (as defined by FIN
46R) unless certain conditions exist.

The principal entities in which we possess a variable interest include franchise entities, including our unconsolidated affiliates described above. We do not possess any ownership interests in franchise entities except for our investments in various unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, we generally do not provide financial support to franchise entities in a typical franchise relationship.

We also possess variable interests in certain purchasing cooperatives we have formed along with representatives of the franchisee groups of each of our Concepts. These purchasing cooperatives were formed for the purpose of purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment in the U.S. Our equity ownership in each cooperative is generally proportional to our percentage ownership of the U.S. system units for the Concept. We account for our investments in these purchasing cooperatives using the cost method, under which our recorded balances were not significant at December 31, 2005 or December 25, 2004.

As a result of the adoption of FIN 46R, we have not consolidated any franchise entities, purchasing cooperatives or other entities.

Fiscal Year

.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and, as a result, a 53rd week is added every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks. The first three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks in fiscal years with 52 weeks and 17 weeks in fiscal years with 53 weeks.  In fiscal


year 2005, the 53

rd

week added $96 million to total revenues and $23 million to total operating profit in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Our subsidiaries operate on similar fiscal calendars with period or month end dates suited to their businesses. The subsidiaries’ period end dates are within one week of YUM’s period end date with the exception of all of our international businesses except China.  The international businesses except China close one period or one month earlier to facilitate consolidated reporting.

Reclassifications.

We have reclassified certain items in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for prior periods to be comparable with the classification for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.

Specifically, we have reclassified distributions from unconsolidated affiliates from investing activities to operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2004 and 2003. These distributions represent returns on equity investments, and therefore have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” There was no impact on the previously reported Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of the reclassifications. The reclassifications increased net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows by $55 million and $46 million for the years ended 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Franchise and License Operations.

We execute franchise or license agreements for each unit which set out the terms of our arrangement with the franchisee or licensee.  Our franchise and license agreements typically require the franchisee or licensee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based upon a percentage of sales. Subject to our approval and their payment of a renewal fee, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration.

We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities and their representative organizations and our Company operated restaurants. These expenses, along with other costs of servicing of franchise and license agreements are charged to general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses as incurred. Certain direct costs of our franchise and license operations are charged to franchise and license expenses. These costs include provisions for estimated uncollectible fees, franchise and license marketing funding, amortization expense for franchise related intangible assets and certain other direct incremental franchise and license support costs.

We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees or licensees are unable to make their required payments. While we use the best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control. Net provisions for uncollectible franchise and license receivables of $3 million and $1 million were included in franchise and license expense in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Included in franchise and license expense in 2003 was a net benefit for uncollectible franchise and license receivables of $3 million, as we were able to recover previously reserved receivables in excess of current provisions.

Revenue Recognition.

Our revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from our franchisees and licensees. Revenues from Company operated restaurants are recognized when payment is tendered at the time of sale. We recognize initial fees received from a franchisee or licensee as revenue when we have performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise or license agreement, which is generally upon the opening of a store. We recognize continuing fees based upon a percentage of franchisee and licensee sales as earned. We recognize renewal fees when a renewal agreement with a franchisee or licensee becomes effective. We include initial fees collected upon the sale of a restaurant to a franchisee in refranchising gains (losses).

Direct Marketing Costs.

We charge direct marketing costs to expense ratably in relation to revenues over the year in which incurred and, in the case of advertising production costs, in the year the advertisement is first shown. Deferred direct marketing costs, which are classified as prepaid expenses, consist of media and related advertising production costs which will generally be used for the first time in the next fiscal year and have historically not been significant. To the extent we participate in advertising cooperatives, we expense our contributions as incurred. Our advertising expenses


were $497 million, $458 million and $419 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We report substantially all of our direct marketing costs in occupancy and other operating expenses.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses, which we expense as incurred, are reported in G&A expenses. Research and development expenses were $33 million in 2005 and $26 million in both 2004 and 2003.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”), we review our long-lived assets related to each restaurant to be held and used in the business, including any allocated intangible assets subject to amortization, semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We evaluate restaurants using a “two-year history of operating losses” as our primary indicator of potential impairment. Based on the best information available, we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value, which becomes its new cost basis. We generally measure estimated fair market value by discounting estimated future cash flows. In addition, when we decide
to close a restaurant it is reviewed for impairment and
depreciable lives are adjusted based on the expected
disposal date. The impairment evaluation is based on the
estimated cash flows from continuing use through the
expected disposal date plus the expected terminal value.

We account for exit or disposal activities, including store closures, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). Store closure costs include costs of disposing of the assets as well as other facility-related expenses from previously closed stores. These store closure costs are generally expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date we cease using a property under an operating lease, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income, if any. Any subsequent adjustments to that liability as a result of lease termination or changes in estimates of sublease income are recorded in store closure costs. To the extent we sell assets, primarily land, associated with a closed store, any gain or loss upon that sale is also recorded in store closure costs.

Refranchising gains (losses) includes the gains or losses from the sales of our restaurants to new and existing franchisees and the related initial franchise fees, reduced by transaction costs. In executing our refranchising initiatives, we most often offer groups of restaurants. We classify restaurants as held for sale and suspend depreciation and amortization when (a) we make a decision to refranchise; (b) the stores can be immediately removed from operations; (c) we have begun an active program to locate a buyer; (d) significant changes to the plan of sale are not likely; and (e) the sale is probable within one year. We recognize estimated losses on refranchisings when the restaurants are classified as held for sale. We also recognize as refranchising losses impairment associated with stores we have offered to refranchise for a price less than their carrying value, but do not believe have met the
criteria to be classified as held for sale. We recognize
gains on restaurant refranchisings when the sale transaction
closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase
price in at-risk equity, and we are satisfied that the
franchisee can meet its financial obligations. If the
criteria for gain recognition are not met, we defer the gain
to the extent we have a remaining financial exposure in
connection with the sales transaction. Deferred gains are
recognized when the gain recognition criteria are met or as
our financial exposure is reduced. When we make a decision
to retain a store previously held for sale, we revalue the
store at the lower of its (a) net book value at our original
sale decision date less normal depreciation and amortization
that would have been recorded during the period held for
sale or (b) its current fair market value. This value
becomes the store’s new cost basis. We record any
difference between the store’s carrying amount and its
new cost
basis to refranchising gains (losses). Refranchising gains
(losses) also include charges for estimated exposures
related to those partial guarantees of franchisee loan pools
and contingent lease liabilities which arose from
refranchising activities. These exposures are more fully
discussed in Note 21.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, including cash flows from continuing use, terminal value, sublease income and refranchising proceeds. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

.  We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has


occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants.  We recorded no impairment associated with our investments in unconsolidated affiliates during the years ended December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.

Asset Retirement Obligations

.  Effective December 29, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases as of December 29, 2002 that were within the scope of SFAS 143, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax) which did not have a material effect on diluted earnings per common share. The adoption of SFAS 143 also did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004 or December 27, 2003.

Guarantees

.  We account for certain guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of certain obligations undertaken.

We have also issued guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants. Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS 145”). We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The related expense in both instances is included in refranchising gains (losses).

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash equivalents represent funds we have temporarily invested (with original maturities not exceeding three months) as part of managing our day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.

Inventories.

We value our inventories at the lower of cost (computed on the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment.

We state property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and valuation allowances. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:  5 to 25 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 7 years for capitalized software costs. As discussed above, we suspend depreciation and amortization on assets related to restaurants that are held for sale.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements.

We account for our leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases” and other related authoritative guidance. When determining the lease term, we often include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on the Company in such an amount that a renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. The primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might be impaired if we choose not to continue the use of the leased property.

In 2004, we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we were


recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight line basis. The cumulative adjustment, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately $3 million. As the portion of the adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements, the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements.

We record rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any option periods considered in the determination of that lease term.  Contingent rentals are generally based on sales levels in excess of stipulated amounts, and thus are not considered minimum lease payments and are included in rent expense as they accrue.  We generally do not receive leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a store that is subject to a lease.  We capitalize rent associated with leased land or buildings while we are constructing a restaurant even if such construction period is subject to a rent holiday.  Such capitalized rent is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease upon opening of the restaurant.  We will begin expensing rent for construction periods beginning January 1, 2006 and thereafter, whether paid or subject to
a rent holiday, in accordance with the FASB Staff Position
No. 13-1, “Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during
a Construction Period” (“FSP 13-1”).  We do
not anticipate that the adoption of FSP 13-1 will
significantly impact our results of operations.

Internal Development Costs and Abandoned Site Costs.

We capitalize direct costs associated with the site acquisition and construction of a Company unit on that site, including direct internal payroll and payroll-related costs. Only those site-specific costs incurred subsequent to the time that the site acquisition is considered probable are capitalized. If we subsequently make a determination that a site for which internal development costs have been capitalized will not be acquired or developed, any previously capitalized internal development costs are expensed and included in G&A expenses.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company accounts for acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and other acquisitions of business that may occur from time to time in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”). Goodwill in such acquisitions represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. SFAS 141 specifies criteria to be used in determining whether intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. We base amounts assigned to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on independent appraisals or internal estimates.

The Company accounts for recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). In accordance with SFAS 142, we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, we amortize the intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The weighted average useful life of our amortizable franchise contract rights and our amortizable trademarks/brands is 33 years and 30 years, respectively.

As discussed above, we suspend amortization on those intangible
assets with a defined life that are allocated to restaurants
that are held for sale.

In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142, goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. (see Note 20) and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Goodwill impairment tests consist of a comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally estimate fair value based on discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. We have selected the beginning of our fourth quarter as the date on which to perform our ongoing annual impairment test for goodwill. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, there was no
impairment of goodwill identified during our annual
impairment testing.


For indefinite-lived intangible assets, our impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. Fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows associated with the intangible asset. We also perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter. As discussed in Note 9, we recorded a $5 million charge in 2003 as a result of the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. This charge was recorded in facility actions. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was recorded in 2005 or 2004.

Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable.  An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset’s future remaining life.

Share-Based Employee Compensation.

In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), supersedes APB 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”  The provisions of SFAS 123R are similar to those of SFAS 123, however, SFAS 123R requires all new, modified and unvested share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis for the fair value of
awards that actually vest.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective application transition method effective September 4, 2005, the beginning of our fourth quarter. As permitted by SFAS 123R, we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (our fiscal year 2005). As such, the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 are required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures (modified subject to certain corrections noted during the fourth quarter of 2005 that impacted net income by approximately $0.5 million in each quarter) under the provisions of SFAS 123. However, years prior to 2005 have not been restated.

The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the reduction of operating profit of $58 million ($10 million in payroll and employee benefits and $48 million in G&A expense), a reduction of net income of $38 million (net of tax benefits of $20 million), a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.13 per share, a reduction of $87 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $87 million in cash flows from financing activities.  The adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in the reduction of fourth quarter operating profit of $18 million ($3 million in payroll and employee benefits and $15 million in G&A expense), a reduction of net income of $12 million (net of tax benefits of $6 million) and a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 per share.

The following table shows the 2005 quarterly after-tax effect of adoption of SFAS 123R on the first three quarters of 2005 as previously reported.

Prior to 2005, all share-based payments were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and its related Interpretations. Accordingly, no expense was reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock options, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to all share-based payments for those years.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Our use of derivative instruments has included interest rate swaps and collars, treasury locks and foreign currency forward contracts. In addition, on a limited basis we utilize commodity futures and options contracts. Our interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with financial institutions while our commodity derivative contracts are exchange traded.

We account for these derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) as amended by SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 149”). SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in the results of operations. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow
hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings
in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in the
results of operations immediately. For derivative
instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain
or loss is recognized in the results of operations
immediately. See Note 13 for a discussion of our use of
derivative instruments, management of credit risk inherent
in derivative instruments and fair value information.

Common Stock Share Repurchases.

From time to time, we repurchase shares of our Common Stock under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.  Shares repurchased constitute authorized, but unissued shares under the North Carolina laws under which we are incorporated. Additionally, our Common Stock has no par or stated value.  Accordingly, we record the full value of share repurchases against Common Stock except when to do so would result in a negative balance in our Common Stock account.  In such instances, on a period basis, we record the cost of any further share repurchases as a reduction in retained earnings.  Due to the large number of share repurchases and the increase in our Common Stock value over the past several years, our Common Stock balance reached zero


during the fourth quarter of 2005.  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2005, $87 million in share repurchases were recorded as a reduction in retained earnings.  We have no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends provided total shareholders’ equity is positive. See Note 18 for additional information.

Assets held for sale at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 total $11 million and $7 million, respectively, of U.S. property, plant and equipment, primarily land, on which we previously operated restaurants and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Wrench Litigation

We recorded income of $2 million in 2005 from a settlement with an insurance carrier related to the Wrench litigation.  Income of $14 million was recorded for 2004 reflecting settlements associated with the Wrench litigation for amounts less than previously accrued as well as related insurance recoveries. Expense of $42 million was recorded as Wrench litigation for 2003 reflecting the amounts awarded to the plaintiff and interest thereon. See Note 21 for a discussion of Wrench litigation.

AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits)

AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc. (“AmeriServe”) was the primary distributor of food and paper supplies to our U.S. stores when it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January 31, 2000. A plan of reorganization for AmeriServe (the “POR”) was approved on November 28, 2000, which resulted in, among other things, the assumption of our distribution agreement, subject to certain amendments, by McLane Company, Inc. During the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, we took a number of actions to ensure continued supply to our system. Those actions resulted in significant expense for the Company, primarily recorded in 2000. Under the POR, we are entitled to proceeds from certain residual assets, preference claims and other legal recoveries of the estate.

Income of $2 million, $16 million and $26 million was recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts primarily resulted from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process.

(a) Reflects a gain related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity, principally for cash. This transaction generated a one-time net gain of approximately $11 million for YUM as cash proceeds (net of expenses) of approximately $25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate.

(b)

Relates to a financial recovery from a supplier ingredient issue in mainland China totaling $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $4 million of which was recognized through equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  Our KFC business in mainland China was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late March, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we entered into an agreement with the supplier for a partial recovery of our losses.

Unamortized intangible assets

Trademarks/brands

$


$



We have recorded intangible assets through past acquisitions representing the value of our KFC, LJS and A&W trademarks/brands.  The value of a trademark/brand is determined based upon the value derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise and licensee stores, for the use of the trademark/brand.  We have determined that our KFC trademark/brand intangible asset has an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized.

When we acquired YGR in 2002 we assigned $140 million to the LJS trademark/brand and $72 million to the A&W trademark/brand.  At the date of the acquisition, we determined that both of these intangible assets had indefinite lives.  However, based on business decisions we made in 2005 and 2003 with regard to these Concepts, we reconsidered the expected useful lives of these brand intangibles and at December 31, 2005 both of these assets are being amortized over their expected useful lives.

In 2005, we decided to adjust development of certain multibrand combinations with LJS.  While we and our franchisees continue to build new LJS stand alone units as well as multibrand units that include LJS, our decision to reallocate certain capital spending in the near term to other investment alternatives was considered an economic factor that may limit the useful life of the LJS trademark/brand.  Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2005 we began to amortize the LJS trademark/brand over thirty years, the typical term of our multibrand franchise agreements including one renewal.  We reviewed the LJS trademark/brand for impairment prior to beginning amortization in 2005 and determined no impairment existed.  Amortization expense of the LJS trademark/brand approximated $4 million in 2005.  When the LJS trademark/brand was considered to be an indefinite-life intangible asset in 2004 and 2003 and was
therefore subject to annual impairment tests, we determined
that the fair value of the LJS trademark/brand was in excess
of its carrying value.

In 2003, we decided to close or refranchise substantially all Company-owned A&W restaurants that we had acquired.  These restaurants were low-volume, mall-based units that were inconsistent with the remainder of our Company-owned portfolio.  Also, at that time we decided to focus more on short-term development opportunities at LJS.  These decisions negatively impacted the fair value of the A&W trademark/brand because we assumed less development of A&W in the near term than forecasted at the date of acquisition.  Accordingly, we recorded a $5 million charge in 2003 to facility actions to write the value of the A&W trademark/brand down to its fair value.  Our decision to no longer operate the acquired stand-alone Company-owned A&W restaurants was considered a factor that limited the A&W trademark/brand expected useful life.  Subsequent to the recording of the impairment in 2003, we
began amortizing the A&W trademark/brand remaining
balance over a period of thirty years, the typical term of
our multibrand franchise agreements including one renewal.
Amortization expense of the A&W trademark/brand
approximated $2 million in 2005 and 2004 and $1 million in
2003.

Amortization expense for all definite-lived intangible assets was $13 million in 2005, $8 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets will approximate $12 million in 2006 through 2010.

Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”), which matures in September 2009.  The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain other transactions as specified in the agreement. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2005.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, our unused Credit Facility totaled $809 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $191 million.  There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at the end of 2005 while outstanding borrowings at December 25, 2004 were $19 million.  The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.35% to 1.625% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or 0.00% to 0.20% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. In 2005, 2004
and 2003, we expensed facility fees of approximately $2
million, $4 million and $6 million, respectively.

Additionally, on November 8, 2005, we executed a five-year revolving credit facility (the “International Credit Facility” or “ICF”) on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries.  The total facility amount is $350 million, with separate sublimits for each of the three subsidiaries.  The ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM and by YUM’s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the Credit Facility.  We were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of 2005.

There were borrowings of $180 million and available credit of $170 million outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2005.  The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.20% to 1.20% over the LIBOR or 0.00% to 0.20% over a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branch’s publicly announced reference rate or the “Canadian Dollar Offered Rate” plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUM’s performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly.


On November 15, 2004, we voluntarily redeemed all of our 7.45% Senior Unsecured Notes that were due in May 2005 (the “2005 Notes”) in accordance with their original terms. The 2005 Notes, which had a total face value of $350 million, were redeemed for approximately $358 million using primarily cash on hand as well as some borrowings under our Credit Facility. The redemption amount approximated the carrying value of the 2005 Notes, including a derivative instrument adjustment under SFAS 133, resulting in no significant impact on net income upon redemption.

In 1997, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for offerings of up to $2 billion of senior unsecured debt, of which $150 million is available for issuance at December 31, 2005.  The following table summarizes all Senior Unsecured Notes issued under this shelf registration that remain outstanding at December 31, 2005:

Note 12 – Leases

At December 31, 2005 we operated over 7,500 restaurants, leasing the underlying land and/or building in over 5,500 of those restaurants with our commitments expiring at various dates through 2087. We also lease office space for headquarters and support functions, as well as certain office and restaurant equipment. We do not consider any of these individual leases material to our operations. Most leases require us to pay related executory costs, which include property taxes, maintenance and insurance.

Note 13 - Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Derivative Instruments

- We enter into interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense for a portion of our debt. Under the contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between variable rate and fixed rate amounts calculated on a notional principal amount. At both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, interest rate derivative instruments outstanding had notional amounts of $850 million. These swaps have reset dates and floating rate indices which match those of our underlying fixed-rate debt and have been designated as fair value hedges of a portion of that debt. As the swaps qualify for the short-cut method under SFAS 133, no ineffectiveness has been recorded.  The net fair value of these swaps as of December 31, 2005 was a net liability of
approximately $5 million, of which $4 million and $9 million
have been included in other assets and other liabilities and
deferred credits, respectively.  The net fair value of these
swaps as of December 25, 2004 was a net asset of
approximately $29 million, of which $30 million and $1
million have been included in other assets and other
liabilities and deferred credits, respectively. The portion
of this fair value which has not yet been recognized as an
addition/reduction to interest expense at December 31, 2005
and December 25, 2004 has been included as a
reduction/addition to long-term debt (a $6 million reduction
and a $21 million addition, respectively).

Additionally, due to early redemption of the underlying 7.45% Senior Unsecured Notes on November 15, 2004 (see Note 11), pay-variable interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $350 million no longer qualified for hedge accounting at December 25, 2004. As we elected to hold these swaps until their May 2005 maturity, we entered into new pay-fixed interest rate swaps with offsetting notional amounts and terms. Gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the pay-variable swaps were recognized in the results of operations through May 2005 but these gains or losses were almost entirely offset by changes in fair value of the pay-fixed swaps.  These swaps were settled upon their maturities.


The fair value of both of these swaps were in an asset position as of December 25, 2004 with a fair value totaling approximately $9 million. This fair value was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments

- We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing our exposure to cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain foreign currency denominated financial instruments, the majority of which are intercompany short-term receivables and payables. The notional amount, maturity date, and currency of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables. For those foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have designated as cash flow hedges, we measure ineffectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the forward contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item. No ineffectiveness was recognized in 2005, 2004 or 2003 for those foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

Equity Derivative Instruments

- On December 3, 2004,

we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the “Program”). In connection with the Program, a third-party investment bank borrowed approximately 5.4 million shares of our Common Stock from shareholders. We then repurchased those shares at their then market value of $46.58 per share from the investment bank for approximately $250 million. The repurchase was made pursuant to the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2004.

Simultaneously, we entered into a forward contract with the investment bank that was indexed to the number of shares repurchased. Under the terms of the forward contract, we were required to pay or entitled to receive a price adjustment based on the difference between the weighted average price of our Common Stock during the duration of the Program and the initial purchase price of $46.58 per share.  At our election, any payments we were obligated to make were either to be in cash or in shares of our Common Stock (not to exceed 15 million shares as specified in the forward contract).  The Program was completed during the quarter ended March 19, 2005 and we made a cash payment of approximately $3 million to the investment bank to settle the forward contract in full. This payment representing the change in fair value of the forward contract was recognized in accordance with EITF 00-19,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled In, a Company’s Own
Stock” as an adjustment to Common Stock and is included
in share repurchases in Note 18.

Commodity Derivative Instruments

- We also utilize, on a limited basis, commodity futures and options contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations over the next twelve months. Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Commodity future and options contracts did not significantly impact the Consolidated Financial Statements in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Deferred Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

- As of December 31, 2005, we had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $1 million, net of tax. The loss, which primarily arose from the settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the issuance of certain amounts of our fixed-rate debt, will be reclassified into earnings from January 1, 2006 through 2012 as an increase to interest expense on this debt.


Credit Risks

Credit risk from interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts is dependent both on movement in interest and currency rates and the possibility of non-payment by counterparties. We mitigate credit risk by entering into these agreements with high-quality counterparties, and settle swap and forward rate payments on a net basis.

Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from franchisees and licensees for initial and continuing fees. In addition, we have notes and lease receivables from certain of our franchisees. The financial condition of these franchisees and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our Concepts. This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the large number of franchisees and licensees of each Concept and the short-term nature of the franchise and license fee receivables.

Fair Value

At December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated the carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying value after consideration of recorded allowances.

Note 14 – Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits

Pension Benefits

-We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time U.S. salaried employees, certain U.S. hourly employees and certain international employees. The most significant of these plans, the YUM Retirement Plan (the “Plan”), is funded while benefits from the other plans are paid by the Company as incurred. During 2001, the plans covering our U.S. salaried employees were amended such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by YUM after September 30, 2001 is not eligible to participate in those plans. Benefits are based on years of service and earnings or stated amounts for each year of service.


Postretirement Medical Benefits

- Our postretirement plan provides health care benefits, principally to U.S. salaried retirees and their dependents. This plan includes retiree cost sharing provisions. During 2001, the plan was amended such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by YUM after September 30, 2001 is not eligible to participate in this plan. Employees hired prior to September 30, 2001 are eligible for benefits if they meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits.

Obligation and Funded Status at September 30:

The following chart summarizes the balance sheet impact, as well as benefit obligations, assets, and funded status associated with the pension and postretirement medical benefits plans based on actuarial valuations prepared as of September 30, 2005 and 2004 (the Plan Measurement Date).

Our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the weighted-average of expected future returns on the asset categories included in our target investment allocation based primarily on the historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions.

There is a cap on our medical liability for certain retirees. The cap for Medicare eligible retirees was reached in 2000 and the cap for non-Medicare eligible retirees is expected to be reached in 2009; once the cap  is reached, our annual cost per retiree will not increase. A one-percentage-point increase or decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have less than a $1 million impact on total service and interest cost and on the post retirement benefit obligation.

Our primary objectives regarding the pension assets are to optimize return on assets subject to acceptable risk and to maintain liquidity, meet minimum funding requirements and minimize plan expenses. To achieve these objectives, we have adopted a passive investment strategy in which the asset performance is driven primarily by the investment allocation. Our target investment allocation is 70% equity securities and 30% debt securities, consisting primarily of low cost index mutual funds that track several sub-categories of equity and debt security performance. The investment


strategy is primarily driven by our Plan’s participants’ ages and reflects a long-term investment horizon favoring a higher equity component in the investment allocation.

A mutual fund held as an investment by the Plan includes YUM stock in the amount of $0.3 million and $0.2 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively (less than 1% of total plan assets in each instance).

Benefit Payments

The benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are set forth below:

Expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation on our measurement date of September 30, 2005 and include benefits attributable to estimated further employee service.

Note 15 –Stock Options

At year-end 2005, we had four stock option plans in effect: the YUM! Brands, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1999 LTIP”), the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1997 LTIP”), the YUM! Brands, Inc. Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (“RGM Plan”) and the YUM! Brands, Inc. SharePower Plan (“SharePower”). During 2003, the 1999 LTIP was amended, subsequent to shareholder approval, to increase the total number of shares available for issuance and to make certain other technical and clarifying changes.

We may grant awards of up to 29.8 million shares and 45.0 million shares of stock under the 1999 LTIP, as amended, and 1997 LTIP, respectively. Potential awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 1999 LTIP include stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. Potential awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 1997 LTIP include stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance restricted stock units. Prior to January 1, 2002, we also could grant stock options and incentive stock options under the 1997 LTIP. Through December 31, 2005, we have issued only stock options and performance restricted stock units under the 1997 LTIP and have issued only stock options under the 1999 LTIP.

We may grant stock options under the 1999 LTIP to purchase shares at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date of grant. New option grants under the 1999 LTIP can have varying vesting provisions and exercise periods. Previously granted options under the 1997 LTIP and 1999 LTIP vest in periods ranging from immediate to 2009 and expire ten to fifteen years after grant.

We may grant options to purchase up to 15.0 million shares of stock under the RGM Plan at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date of grant. RGM Plan options granted have a four year vesting period and expire ten years after grant.  Certain RGM Plan options are granted upon attainment of performance conditions in the previous year.  Expense for such options is recognized over a period that includes the time which the performance condition is met.


We may grant awards of up to 14.0 million shares of stock under SharePower.  Potential awards to employees under SharePower include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units.  Awards granted shall have an exercise price equal to the average market price of the stock on the date of grant under SharePower.  SharePower awards granted subsequent to the Spin-off Date consist only of stock options to date, which vest over a period ranging from one to four years and expire no longer than ten years after grant.  Previously granted SharePower options have expirations through 2015.

At the Spin-off Date, we converted certain of the unvested options to purchase PepsiCo stock that were held by our employees to YUM stock options under either the 1997 LTIP or SharePower. We converted the options at amounts and exercise prices that maintained the amount of unrealized stock appreciation that existed immediately prior to the Spin-off. The vesting dates and exercise periods of the options were not affected by the conversion. Based on their original PepsiCo grant date, these converted options vest in periods ranging from one to ten years and expire ten to fifteen years after grant.

We estimated the fair value of each option grant made during 2005, 2004 and 2003 as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that it was appropriate to group our stock option grants into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term.  These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant-level employees under the RGM Plan and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans.

We have traditionally used six years as the expected term of all stock option grants.  In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R and the increasing amount of historical data we now possess with regard to stock option exercise activity, we revaluated our expected term assumptions.  Based on historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior, we determined that the expected life for options granted under the RGM Plan was five years.  For options granted to our above-store executives, we determined that an expected life of six years was appropriate.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R we have traditionally based expected volatility on Company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option.  We are in the process of revaluating expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded
options.  Options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS
123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 were not significant.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $17.78, $15.11, and $9.43, respectively.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2005, December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, was $271 million, $282 million and $90 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005, there was $119 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which will be reduced by any forfeitures that occur, related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.  The total fair value at grant date of stock options vested during 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $57 million, $103 million, and $95million, respectively.

Cash received from options exercises for 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $148 million, $200 million and $110 million, respectively.  Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with options exercises for 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $94 million, $102 million and $26 million, respectively.

The Company has a policy of repurchasing shares on the open market to satisfy share option exercises and expects to repurchase approximately 8.0 million shares during 2006 based on estimates of option exercises for that period.

Note 16 – Other Compensation and Benefit Programs

Executive Income Deferral Program (the “EID Plan”)

The EID Plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their annual salary and all or a portion of their incentive compensation. As defined by the EID Plan, we credit the amounts deferred with earnings based on the investment options selected by the participants. In 2004 and 2003, these investment options were limited to cash and phantom shares of our Common Stock. In 2005, we added two new phantom investment options to the plan, a Stock Index Fund and the Bond Index Fund. Additionally, the EID Plan allows participants to defer incentive compensation to purchase phantom shares of our Common Stock at a 25% discount from the average market price at the date of deferral (the “Discount Stock Account”). Deferrals to the Discount Stock Account are similar to a restricted stock unit award in that participants will forfeit both the discount and incentive compensation amounts deferred to the
Discount Stock Account if they voluntarily separate from
employment during the two year vesting period. We expense
the intrinsic value of the discount over the vesting period.
Investments in cash, the Stock Index fund and the Bond Index
fund will be distributed in cash at a date as elected by the
employee and therefore are classified as a liability on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We recognize compensation
expense for the appreciation or depreciation of these
investments.  As investments in the phantom shares of our
Common Stock can only be settled in shares of our Common
Stock, we do not recognize compensation expense for the
appreciation or the depreciation, if any, of these
investments. Deferrals into the phantom shares of our Common
Stock are credited to the Common Stock Account.


As of December 31, 2005 total deferrals to phantom shares of our Common Stock within the EID Plan totaled approximately 3.3 million shares.  We recognized compensation expense of $4 million in 2005 and 2004 and $3 million in 2003 for the EID Plan.

Restricted Stock

In November 1997, we granted performance restricted stock units of YUM’s Common Stock in the amount of $3.6 million to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The award was made under the 1997 LTIP and was to be paid in Common Stock or cash at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Payment of the award was made in cash on February 6, 2006 on attainment of certain pre-established earnings thresholds. The annual expense related to this award included in earnings was $0.4 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Contributory 401(k) Plan

We sponsor a contributory plan to provide retirement benefits under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”) for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees. Participants are able to elect to contribute up to 25% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. Participants may allocate their contributions to one or any combination of 10 investment options within the 401(k) Plan.  We match 100% of the participant’s contribution to the 401(k) Plan up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the participant’s contribution on the next 2% of eligible compensation. All matching contributions are made to the YUM Common Stock Fund. We recognized as compensation expense our total matching contribution of $12 million in 2005, $11 million in 2004 and $10 million in 2003.

Note 17 – Shareholders’ Rights Plan

In July 1998, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of August 3, 1998 (the “Record Date”).  As a result of the two for one stock split distributed on June 17, 2002, each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one right for every two shares of Common Stock (one half right per share).  Each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase a unit consisting of one one thousandth of a share (a “Unit”) of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, at a purchase price of $130 per Unit, subject to adjustment.  The rights, which do not have voting rights, will become exercisable for our Common Stock ten business days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for, 15% or more, or 20% more if such person or
group owned 10% or more on the adoption date of this plan,
of our Common Stock.  In the event the rights become
exercisable for Common Stock, each right will entitle its
holder (other than the Acquiring Person as defined in the
Agreement) to purchase, at the right’s then current
exercise price, YUM Common Stock and thereafter we are
acquired in a merger or other business combination, each
right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
right’s then current exercise price, Common Stock of
the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise
price of the right.

We can redeem the rights in their entirety, prior to becoming exercisable, at $0.01 per right under certain specified conditions.  The rights expire on July 21, 2008, unless we extend that date or we have earlier redeemed or exchanged the right as provided in the Agreement.

This description of the right is qualified in its entirety by reference to the original Rights Agreement, dated July 21, 1998, and the Agreement of Substitution and Amendment of Common Share Rights Agreement, dated August 28, 2003, between YUM and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, the Right Agent (both including the exhibits thereto).

Note 18 – Shareholders’ Equity

The Company initiated quarterly dividend payments to our stockholders in 2004. In 2004, the Company declared three cash dividends of $0.10 per share of Common Stock. In 2005, the Company declared one cash dividend of $0.10 per share of Common Stock and three cash dividends of $0.115 per share of Common Stock. The Company had dividends payable of $32 million and $29 million as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively.


Under the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock in the following share repurchase programs during 2005, 2004 and 2003.  All amounts exclude applicable transaction fees.

As of December 31, 2005, we have $469 million available for future repurchases under our November 2005 share repurchase program.  Based on market conditions and other factors, additional repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

– Comprehensive income is net income plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity. Amounts included in other accumulated comprehensive loss for the Company’s derivative instruments and minimum pension liability are recorded net of the related income tax effects.

Included in the federal tax provision above for 2005 and 2004 is approximately $20 million current tax and $6 million deferred tax, respectively, provided on $500 million of earnings in our foreign investments which we repatriated to the U.S. in 2005.  We made the determination to repatriate such earnings as the result of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which became law on October 22, 2004 (the “Act”). The Act allowed a dividends received deduction of 85% of repatriated qualified foreign earnings in fiscal year 2005.

Taxes payable were reduced by $94 million, $102 million and $26 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of stock option exercises.

Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in foreign countries decreased by $10 million in 2005 and increased by $45 million and $19 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Valuation allowances related to federal deferred tax assets decreased by $13 million in 2005.
Valuation allowances in certain states decreased by $8 million in 2005 ($5 million, net of federal tax) and increased by $6 million ($4 million, net of federal tax) in 2003. The fluctuations were a result of determinations regarding the likelihood of use of certain loss carryforwards and credits prior to expiration.

The 2005 state deferred tax provision includes $8 million ($5 million, net of federal tax) for the impact of changes in state statutory tax rates. In 2004, the deferred foreign tax provision included a $1 million credit to reflect the impact of changes in statutory tax rates in various countries.

The 2005 tax rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of certain foreign tax credits that we were able to substantiate during 2005.  In 2003, we amended certain prior year returns upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit on our U.S. tax returns for foreign taxes paid than to deduct such taxes, as had been done when the returns were originally filed. Both benefits are non-recurring.

The adjustments to reserves and prior years in 2005 and 2004 were primarily driven by the reversal of reserves associated with audits that were settled.

See above for a discussion of the valuation allowance additions (reversals).

Federal income tax receivables of $59 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December 25, 2004.

We have not provided deferred tax on the undistributed earnings from our foreign investments as we believe they are permanent in nature, except for approximately $2 million of both federal and foreign tax provided on undistributed earnings we intend to distribute. We estimate that our total net undistributed earnings upon which we have not provided deferred tax total approximately $400 million at December 31, 2005. A determination of the deferred tax liability on such earnings is not practicable.

We have available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards totaling approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2005 to reduce future tax of YUM and certain subsidiaries. The carryforwards are related to a number of foreign and state jurisdictions. Of these carryforwards, $21 million expire in 2006 and $1.2 billion expire at various times between 2006 and 2024. The remaining carryforwards of approximately $330 million do not expire.

Note 20 – Reportable Operating Segments

We are principally engaged in developing, operating, franchising and licensing the worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell concepts, and since May 7, 2002, the LJS and A&W concepts, which were added when we acquired YGR. KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, LJS and A&W operate throughout the U.S. and in 95, 90, 13, 5 and 10 countries and territories outside the U.S., respectively. Our five largest international markets based on operating profit in 2005 are China, United Kingdom, Australia, Asia Franchise and Mexico. At December 31, 2005, we had investments in 7 unconsolidated affiliates outside the U.S. which operate principally KFC and/or Pizza Hut restaurants. These unconsolidated affiliates operate in China, Japan and the United Kingdom.


We identify our operating segments based on management responsibility.  As noted in Note 1, in 2005 we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes in our management reporting structure.  The China Division includes mainland China, Thailand, KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations.  Segment information for previous periods has been restated to reflect this reporting.  For purposes of applying SFAS No. 131, “Disclosure About Segments of An Enterprise and Related Information” (“SFAS 131”) in the U.S., we consider LJS and A&W to be a single segment. We consider our KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and LJS/A&W operating segments in the U.S. to be similar and therefore have aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment.

Note 21 – Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Guarantees and Contingencies

As a result of (a) assigning our interest in obligations under real estate leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants; (b) contributing certain Company restaurants to unconsolidated affiliates; and (c)


guaranteeing certain other leases, we are frequently contingently liable on lease agreements. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2031. As of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, the potential amount of undiscounted payments we could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary lessee was $374 million and $365 million, respectively. The present value of these potential payments discounted at our pre-tax cost of debt at December 31, 2005 was $316 million. Our franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non-payment under the lease. We believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases. Accordingly, the
liability recorded for our probable exposure under such
leases at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 was not
material.

Franchise Loan Pool Guarantees

- We had provided approximately $16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Company’s historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants, at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004. In support of these guarantees, we posted letters of credit of $4 million.  We also provide a standby letter of credit of $18 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $77 and $90 million at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively.

Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss (gain). New loans added to the loan pools in 2005 were not significant.

Unconsolidated Affiliates Guarantees

- We have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of unconsolidated affiliates totaling zero and $34 million at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively. Our unconsolidated affiliates had total revenues of over $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 and assets and debt of approximately $775 million and $32 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005.

Other Third Parties Guarantees

- We have also guaranteed certain lines of credit, loans and letters of credit of third parties totaling $1 million and $9 million at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively. If all such lines of credit and letters of credit were fully drawn the maximum contingent liability under these arrangements would be approximately $2 million as of December 31, 2005 and $26 million as of December 25, 2004.

We have varying levels of recourse provisions and collateral that mitigate the risk of loss related to our guarantees of these financial arrangements of unconsolidated affiliates and other third parties. Accordingly, our recorded liability as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 is not significant.

Insurance Programs

We are self-insured for a substantial portion of our current and prior years’ coverage including workers’ compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively, “property and casualty losses”). To mitigate the cost of our exposures for certain property and casualty losses, we make annual decisions to self-insure the risks of loss up to defined maximum per occurrence retentions on a line by line basis or to combine certain lines of coverage into one loss pool with a single self-insured aggregate retention. The Company then purchases insurance coverage, up to a certain limit, for losses that exceed the self-insurance per occurrence or aggregate retention. The insurers’ maximum aggregate loss limits are significantly above our actuarially determined probable losses; therefore, we believe the likelihood of losses
exceeding the insurers’ maximum aggregate loss limits
is remote.

In the U.S. and in certain other countries, we are also self-insured for healthcare claims and long-term disability for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We have accounted for our retained liabilities for property and casualty losses, healthcare and long-term disability claims, including reported and incurred but not reported claims, based on information provided by independent actuaries.


Due to the inherent volatility of actuarially determined property and casualty loss estimates, it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in estimated losses which could be material to our growth in quarterly and annual net income. We believe that we have recorded reserves for property and casualty losses at a level which has substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of adverse developments and/or volatility.

Change of Control Severance Agreements

The Company has severance agreements with certain key executives (the “Agreements”) that are renewable on an annual basis. These Agreements are triggered by a termination, under certain conditions, of the executive’s employment following a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Agreements. If triggered, the affected executives would generally receive twice the amount of both their annual base salary and their annual incentive, at the higher of target or actual for the preceding year, a proportionate bonus at the higher of target or actual performance earned through the date of termination, outplacement services and a tax gross-up for any excise taxes. These Agreements have a three-year term and automatically renew each January 1 for another three-year term unless the Company elects not to renew the Agreements. If these Agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2005,
payments of approximately $39 million would have been made.
In the event of a change of control, rabbi trusts would be
established and used to provide payouts under existing
deferred and incentive compensation plans.

Litigation

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business.  We provide reserves for such claims and contingencies when payment is probable and estimable in accordance with SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies.”

On August 13, 2003, a class action lawsuit against Pizza Hut, Inc., entitled

Coldiron v. Pizza Hut, Inc.

, was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California. Plaintiff alleges that she and other current and former Pizza Hut Restaurant General Managers (“RGMs”) were improperly classified as exempt employees under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).  There is also a pendent state law claim, alleging that current and former RGMs in California were misclassified under that state’s law.  Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime wages and penalties.  On May 5, 2004, the District Court granted conditional certification of a nationwide class of RGMs under the FLSA claim, providing notice to prospective class members and an opportunity to join the class.  Approximately 12 percent of the eligible class
members have elected to join the litigation.  However, on
June 30, 2005, the District Court granted Pizza Hut’s
motion to strike all FLSA class members who joined the
litigation after July 15, 2004. The effect of this order is
to reduce the number of FLSA class members to only
approximately 88 (or approximately 2.5% of the eligible
class members).

In November 2005, the parties agreed to a settlement.  Pizza Hut believes that definitive settlement documents will be preliminarily and finally approved by the Court within sixty to ninety days following submission of the documents to the Court.  We have provided for this settlement amount in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

On November 26, 2001, a lawsuit against Long John Silver’s, Inc. (“LJS”) entitled

Kevin Johnson, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. Long John Silver’s, Inc.

(“Johnson”) was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division.  Johnson’s suit alleged that LJS’s former “Security/Restitution for Losses” policy (the “Policy”) provided for deductions from RGMs and Assistant Restaurant General Managers (“ARGMs”) salaries that violate the salary basis test for exempt personnel under regulations issued pursuant to the FLSA.  Johnson alleged that all RGMs and ARGMs who were employed by LJS for the three year period prior to the lawsuit – i.e., since November 26, 1998 – should be treated as the equivalent of hourly
employees and thus were eligible under the FLSA for overtime
for any hours worked over 40 during all weeks in the
recovery period.  In addition, Johnson claimed that the
potential members of the class are entitled to certain
liquidated damages and attorney’s fees under the FLSA.

LJS believed that Johnson’s claims, as well as the claims of all other similarly situated parties, should be resolved in individual arbitrations pursuant to LJS’s Dispute Resolution Program (“DRP”), and that a collective action to resolve


these claims in court was clearly inappropriate under the current state of the law.  Accordingly, LJS moved to compel arbitration in the Johnson case.  LJS and Johnson also agreed to stay the action effective December 17, 2001, pending mediation and entered into a tolling agreement for that purpose.  After mediation did not resolve the case, and after limited discovery and a hearing, the Court determined on June 7, 2004, that Johnson’s individual claims should be referred to arbitration.  Johnson appealed, and the decision of the District Court was affirmed in all respects by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on July 5, 2005.

On December 19, 2003, counsel for plaintiff in the above referenced Johnson lawsuit, filed a separate demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on behalf of former LJS managers Erin Cole and Nick Kaufman, who reside in South Carolina (the “Cole Arbitration”).  Claimants in the Cole Arbitration demand a class arbitration on behalf of the same putative class - and the same underlying FLSA claims - as were alleged in the Johnson lawsuit.  The complaint in the Cole Arbitration subsequently was amended to allege a practice of deductions (distinct from the allegations as to the Policy) in violation of the FLSA salary basis test, and to add Victoria McWhorter, another LJS former manager, as an additional claimant.  LJS has denied the claims and the putative class alleged in the Cole Arbitration, and it is LJS’s position that the claims of Cole, Kaufman, and
McWhorter should be individually arbitrated.

Arbitrations under LJS’s DRP, including the Cole Arbitration, are governed by the rules of the AAA.  In October 2003, the AAA adopted its Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (“AAA Class Rules”).  The AAA appointed an arbitrator for the Cole Arbitration.  On June 15, 2004, the arbitrator issued a clause construction award, ruling that the DRP does not preclude class arbitration.  LJS moved to vacate the clause construction award in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.  On September 15, 2005, the federal court in South Carolina ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear LJS’s motion to vacate.  LJS has appealed the U.S. District Court’s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While judicial review of the clause construction award was pending, the arbitrator permitted claimants to move for a class determination
award, which was opposed by LJS.  On September 19, 2005, the
arbitrator issued a class determination award, certifying a
class of LJS’s RGMs and ARGMs employed between December
17, 1998, and August 22, 2004, on FLSA claims, to proceed on
an opt-out basis under the AAA Class Rules. That class
determination award was upheld on appeal by the United
States District Court for the District of South Carolina on
January 20, 2006. LJS has appealed the ruling of the U.S.
District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit.

LJS believes that the DRP provides for individual arbitrations.  LJS also believes that if the Cole Arbitration must proceed on a class basis, (i) the proceedings should be governed by the opt-in collective action structure of the FLSA, (ii) a class should not be certified under the applicable provisions of the FLSA, and (iii) each individual should not be able to recover for more than two years (and a maximum three years) prior to the date they file a consent to join the arbitration.  We have provided for the estimated costs of the

Cole Arbitration

, based on a projection of eligible claims, the amount of each eligible claim, the estimated legal fees incurred by the claimants and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters.  But in view of the novelties of proceeding under the AAA Class Rules and the inherent
uncertainties of litigation, there can be no assurance that
the outcome of the arbitration will not result in losses in
excess of those currently provided for.

On September 21, 2005, a collective action lawsuit against the Company and KFC Corporation, originally entitled

Parler v. Yum Brands, Inc., d/b/a KFC, and KFC Corporation

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.  Plaintiff alleges that he and other current and former KFC Assistant Unit Managers (“AUM’s”) were improperly classified as exempt employees under the FLSA.  Plaintiff seeks overtime wages and liquidated damages.  On January 17, 2006, the District Court dismissed the claims against the Company with prejudice, leaving KFC Corporation as the sole defendant.  Notice will be mailed to current and former KFC AUM’s advising them of the litigation and providing an opportunity to join the case if they choose to do so.

We believe that KFC has properly classified its AUM’s as exempt under the FLSA and accordingly intend to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit.  However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the outcome of this case cannot be predicted at this time.  Likewise, the amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated.


On December 17, 2002, Taco Bell was named as the defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entitled

Moeller, et al. v. Taco Bell Corp.

On August 4, 2003, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that alleges, among other things, that Taco Bell has discriminated against the class of people who use wheelchairs or scooters for mobility by failing to make its approximately 220 company-owned restaurants in California (the “California Restaurants”) accessible to the class.  Plaintiffs contend that queue rails and other architectural and structural elements of the Taco Bell restaurants relating to the path of travel and use of the facilities by persons with mobility-related disabilities (including parking spaces, ramps, counters, restroom facilities and seating) do not comply with the
U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”),
the Unruh Civil Rights Act (the “Unruh Act”), and
the California Disabled Persons Act (the “CDPA”).
Plaintiffs have requested:  (a) an injunction from the
District Court ordering Taco Bell to comply with the ADA and
its implementing regulations; (b) that the District Court
declare Taco Bell in violation of the ADA, the Unruh Act,
and the CDPA; and (c) monetary relief under the Unruh Act or
CDPA.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of the class, are seeking the
minimum statutory damages per offense of either $4,000 under
the Unruh Act or $1,000 under the CDPA for each aggrieved
member of the class.  Plaintiffs contend that there may be
in excess of 100,000 individuals in the class. For
themselves, the four named plaintiffs have claimed aggregate
minimum statutory damages of no less than $16,000, but are
expected to claim greater amounts based on the number of
Taco Bell outlets they visited at which they claim to have
suffered discrimination.

On February 23, 2004, the District Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  The District Court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) mandatory injunctive relief class of all individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs or electric scooters for mobility who, at any time on or after December 17, 2001, were denied, or are currently being denied, on the basis of disability, the full and equal enjoyment of the California Restaurants.  The class includes claims for injunctive relief and minimum statutory damages.

Pursuant to the parties’ agreement, on or about August 31, 2004, the District Court ordered that the trial of this action be bifurcated so that stage one will resolve Plaintiffs'; claims for equitable relief and stage two will resolve Plaintiffs' claims for damages.  The parties are currently proceeding with the equitable relief stage of this action.  During this stage, Taco Bell filed a motion to partially decertify the class to exclude from the Rule 23(b)(2) class claims for monetary damages.  The District Court denied the motion.  Plaintiffs filed their own motion for partial summary judgment as to liability relating to a subset of the California Restaurants.  The District Court denied that motion as well. Discovery is ongoing as of the date of this report.

Taco Bell has denied liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims in this lawsuit.  Although this lawsuit is at a relatively early stage in the proceedings, it is likely that certain of the California Restaurants will be determined to be not fully compliant with accessibility laws and that Taco Bell will be required to take certain steps to make those restaurants fully compliant.  However, at this time, it is not possible to estimate with reasonable certainty the potential costs to bring any non compliant California Restaurants into compliance with applicable state and federal disability access laws.  Nor is it possible at this time to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of liability for monetary damages on a class wide basis to Taco Bell.

On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled

Wrench LLC, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp.

(“Wrench”) was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan.  The lawsuit alleged that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its advertising featuring a Chihuahua.  The plaintiffs sought to recover monetary damages under several theories, including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea misappropriation, conversion and unfair competition.  On June 10, 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Taco Bell Corp.  Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and oral arguments were held on September 20, 2000. On July 6, 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s judgment in favor
of Taco Bell Corp. and remanded the case to the District
Court.  Taco Bell Corp. unsuccessfully petitioned the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its
petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme
Court was denied on January 21, 2002. The case was returned
to District Court for trial which began on May 14, 2003 and
on June 4, 2003 the jury awarded $30 million to the
plaintiffs.  Subsequently, the plaintiffs moved to
amend the judgment to include pre-judgment interest and
post-judgment interest and Taco Bell filed its post-trial
motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.  On
September 9, 2003, the District Court denied Taco
Bell’s motion and granted the plaintiffs' motion
to amend the judgment.


In view of the jury verdict and subsequent District Court ruling, we recorded a charge of $42 million in 2003.  We appealed the verdict to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and interest continued to accrue during the appeal process.  Prior to a ruling from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, we settled this matter with the Wrench plaintiffs on January 15, 2005.  Concurrent with the settlement with the plaintiffs, we also settled the matter with certain of our insurance carriers.  As a result of these settlements, reversals of previously recorded expense of $14 million were recorded in the year ended December 25, 2004.  We paid the settlement amount to the plaintiffs and received the insurance recovery during the first quarter of 2005.  During the third quarter of 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement with another insurance carrier and as a result income of $2 million was recorded in the quarter.

We intend to seek additional recoveries from our other insurance carriers during the periods in question.  We have also filed suit against Taco Bell’s former advertising agency in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement for the settlement amount as well as any costs that we have incurred in defending this matter.  The District Court has issued a minute order granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment but has requested submissions from the defendant for its review before issuing a final order. We believe that a grant by the District Court of this summary judgment motion would be erroneous under the law.  We will evaluate our options once a final order has been issued.  Any additional recoveries will be recorded as they are realized.

Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into separation and other related agreements (the “Separation Agreements”) governing the Spin-off and our subsequent relationship with PepsiCo. These agreements provide certain indemnities to PepsiCo.

Under terms of the agreement, we have indemnified PepsiCo for any costs or losses it incurs with respect to all letters of credit, guarantees and contingent liabilities relating to our businesses under which PepsiCo remains liable. As of December 31, 2005, PepsiCo remains liable for approximately $28 million on a nominal basis related to these contingencies. This obligation ends at the time PepsiCo is released, terminated or replaced by a qualified letter of credit. We have not been required to make any payments under this indemnity.

Under the Separation Agreements, PepsiCo maintains full control and absolute discretion with regard to any combined or consolidated tax filings for periods through October 6, 1997. PepsiCo also maintains full control and absolute discretion regarding any common tax audit issues. Although PepsiCo has contractually agreed to, in good faith, use its best efforts to settle all joint interests in any common audit issue on a basis consistent with prior practice, there can be no assurance that determinations made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach, acting on our own behalf. Through December 31, 2005, there have not been any determinations made by PepsiCo where we would have reached a different determination.

The first three quarters of 2005 have been restated pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R.  See Note 2.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a $6 million reduction to correct our previously recorded gain associated with the sale of our Poland/Czech Republic business.  See Note 7.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an $11.5 million ($7 million after tax) adjustment primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the underlying term of the lease. See Note 2.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other information included in this annual report. The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include certain amounts based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. Other financial information presented in the annual report is derived from the financial statements.

We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The system is supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of Conduct program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity. We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the
adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system,
and appropriate actions are taken to address significant
control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving
the system as they are identified.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited and reported on by our independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board. We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were valid and appropriate. Additionally, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited and reported on by KPMG LLP.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, provides oversight to our financial reporting process and our controls to safeguard assets through periodic meetings with our independent auditors, internal auditors and management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee.

Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 31, 2005 provide reasonable assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded.
