PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Our Business

Echostar Communications Corporation, through its DISH Network, is a
leading provider of satellite delivered digital television entertainment
services to customers across the United States. DISH Network provides advanced
digital satellite television services, including hundreds of video, audio and
data channels, interactive television channels, personal video recording, high
definition television, international programming, professional installation and
24-hour customer service.

We started offering subscription television services on the DISH Network
in March 1996. As of December 31, 2002, the DISH Network had approximately 8.18
million subscribers. We now have eight direct broadcast satellites in operation
that enable us to offer over 500 video and audio channels to consumers across
the United States. We believe that the DISH Network offers programming packages
that have a better “price-to-value” relationship than packages currently
offered by most other subscription television providers. As of December 31,
2002, there were over 19 million subscribers to direct broadcast satellite and
other direct-to-home satellite services in the United States. We believe that
there are more than 89 million total pay television subscribers in the United
States, and there continues to be significant unsatisfied demand for high
quality, reasonably priced television programming services.

DISH Network and EchoStar Technologies Corporation

We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries
and operate two principal business units:

•

The DISH Network

— which provides a direct broadcast
satellite subscription television service we refer to as “DBS” in
the United States: and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation —

which designs and
develops DBS set-top boxes, antennae and other digital equipment
for the DISH Network. We refer to this equipment collectively as
“EchoStar receiver systems.” EchoStar Technologies Corporation
also designs, develops and distributes similar equipment for
international satellite service providers.

Other Information

Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol “DISH”. Our principal executive offices are located at 5701 South
Santa Fe Drive, Littleton, Colorado 80120 and our telephone number is (303)
723-1000. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are
accessible free of charge at our website www.echostar.com.

Recent Developments

Redemption of the 9 1/4% Seven Year Notes

. Effective February 1, 2003,
EDBS redeemed all of its outstanding 9 1/4 % Senior Notes due 2006. In
accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $375
million principal amount of the notes was repurchased at 104.625 percent, for a
total of approximately $392 million. The premium paid of approximately $17
million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $3
million, have been recorded as charges to earnings as of February 1, 2003.

Termination of the Proposed Merger with Hughes.

On December 9, 2002 we
reached a termination, settlement and release agreement with General Motors and
Hughes Electronic Corporation to terminate our proposed merger with Hughes.
For more information please see Note 1 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Under the terms of the settlement, Hughes retained its 81%
ownership interest in PanAmSat, which we



were previously obligated to purchase at a price of $22.47 per share, or
approximately $2.7 billion. We also paid a $600 million merger termination fee
to Hughes.

Vivendi Universal.

Effective December 23, 2002 we repurchased all of our
outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock from Vivendi Universal. For
more information please see Note 1 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

DISH NETWORK

Programming

Programming Packages.

We use a “value-based” strategy in structuring the
content and pricing of programming packages available from the DISH Network.
For example, we currently sell our entry-level “America’s Top 50” programming
package, which includes 50 of the most popular video channels, to consumers in
digital format for $24.99 per month. We estimate cable operators charge over
$35 per month, on average, for their entry-level expanded basic service that
typically consists of approximately 55 analog channels, including local
channels. We believe that our “America’s Top 100” CD programming package, which
we currently sell for $33.99 per month, also compares favorably to similar
cable television programming. We believe that our “America’s Top 100” CD
programming package is similar to an expanded basic cable package plus a
digital music service. Based on cable industry statistics, we estimate that
cable operators would typically charge in excess of $45 per month for a similar
package, including local channels.

In addition to the above mentioned programming packages, we also offer our
“America’s Top 150” programming package for $42.99 per month and our “America’s
Everything Pak”, which combines our “America’s Top 150” programming package and
all four premium movie packages, which are discussed below, for $74.99 per
month. For an additional $5.99 per month, we can add satellite-delivered local
channels to any of the above packages for consumers in 59 of the largest
markets in the continental United States. Cable operators generally include
local channels in their programming packages at no additional charge. The use
of spot-beam technology on EchoStar VII and EchoStar VIII gives us the
ability to increase the number of markets where we provide local channels by
satellite, but will reduce the number of channels that could otherwise be
offered ubiquitously across the United States.

Premium Movie Packages.

We currently offer four premium movie packages
which include up to 10 movie channels per package. Currently consumers can
subscribe to a single premium movie package including 10 movie channels for
only $11.99 per month. We believe we currently offer more premium movie
channels than cable typically offers at a comparable price.

International Programming.

Currently, we offer more than 50
foreign-language channels including Spanish, Arabic, French, Hindi, Russian,
Chinese, and others. We also offer foreign-language programming packages. For
example, we believe that our “DISH Latino” package, which includes more than 20
Spanish-language programming channels for $21.99 per month, is one of the most
attractive Spanish-language packages available in the United States. We also
offer “DISH Latino Dos”, our bilingual programming package, which includes more
than 20 English and more than 20 Spanish-language programming channels for
$31.99 per month. In addition, during January 2002, we introduced “DISH Latino
Max”, which includes more than 60 English and more than 20 Spanish-language
programming channels for $41.99 per month. We believe we deliver some of the
most popular foreign-language programming to customers in the United States at
superior values. We also believe foreign-language programming is a valuable
niche product that attracts a number of new subscribers who are unable to get
similar programming elsewhere.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Sales and Marketing.

Independent distributors, retailers and consumer
electronics stores currently sell EchoStar receiver systems and solicit orders
for DISH Network programming services. While we also sell receiver systems and
programming directly, independent retailers are responsible for most of our
sales. These independent retailers are primarily local retailers who specialize
in TV and home entertainment systems. We also sell EchoStar receiver systems
through nationwide retailers such as Costco, Sears and Wal-Mart, and certain
regional consumer



electronic chains. In addition, in 2002, RadioShack Corporation began
selling EchoStar receiver systems and DISH Network programming services through
its more than 5,000 stores and dealers/franchises nationwide.

We currently have an agreement with JVC to distribute our receiver systems
under its label through certain of its nationwide retailers, and an agreement
with Thomson multimedia, Inc. to distribute our receiver systems under the RCA
label through certain of its nationwide retailers.

We offer our distributors and retailers what we believe is a competitive
incentive program. The program offers qualified distributors and retailers the
opportunity to receive, among other things, commissions upon new subscriber
activations and monthly residual incentives dependent, among other things, on
continued consumer subscription to qualified programming.

We use regional and national broadcast and print advertising to promote
the DISH Network. We also offer point-of-sale literature, product displays,
demonstration kiosks and signage for retail outlets. We provide guides to our
retailers and distributors at nationwide educational seminars and directly by
mail that describe DISH Network products and services. Our mobile sales and
marketing team visits retail outlets regularly to reinforce training and ensure
that these outlets quickly fulfill point-of-sale needs. Additionally, we
dedicate one DISH Network channel and provide a retailer specific website to
provide information about special services and promotions that we offer from
time to time.

Our future success in the subscription television industry depends on,
among other factors, our ability to acquire and retain DISH Network
subscribers. Beginning in 1996, to stimulate subscriber growth, expand retail
distribution of our products and build consumer awareness of the DISH Network
brand, we reduced the retail price charged to consumers for EchoStar receiver
systems. Accordingly, since August 1996, we have provided varying levels of
subsidies and incentives to attract customers, including free or subsidized
receiver systems, installations, antenna, programming and other items. The
amount of the subsidy varies depending on many factors. This marketing strategy
emphasizes our long-term business strategy of maximizing future revenue by
selling DISH Network programming to a large potential subscriber base and
rapidly increasing our subscriber base. Since we subsidize certain consumer
up-front costs, we incur significant costs each time we acquire a new
subscriber. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that we will be able
to fully recoup the up-front costs of subscriber acquisition from future
subscription television services revenue.

During July 2000, we began offering our DISH Network subscribers the
option to lease receiver systems under our Digital Home Plan promotion. The
Digital Home Plan offers consumers the ability to lease from one to four
receiver systems with a one-year commitment to one of several qualifying
programming packages. With each plan, consumers receive in-home service and pay
a one-time set-up fee. We expect this marketing strategy will reduce the cost
of acquiring future subscribers by maintaining ownership of the receiver
systems. Upon termination of the Digital Home Plan, subscribers are required to
return the receiver and certain other equipment to us. While we do not recover
all of the equipment upon termination of service, receivers and certain other
equipment that are recovered after deactivation are reconditioned and
re-deployed at a much lower cost than new equipment.

We base our marketing promotions, among other things, on current
competitive conditions. Generally, under most promotions, we subsidize the cost
and installation of EchoStar receiver systems or DISH Network programming in
order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. In some cases, if competition
increases, or we determine for any other reason that it is necessary to
increase our subscriber acquisition costs to attract new customers, our
profitability and costs of operation could be adversely affected.

Interactive Services.

We are continuing to expand our offerings to include
interactive services. During 2001, we began offering DISH Network customers an
interactive digital receiver with a built-in hard disk drive that permits
viewers to pause and record live programs without the need for videotape. We
now offer receivers capable of storing up to 90 hours of programming, and
expect to increase storage capacity on future models to over 250 hours. We also
are offering set-top boxes that can provide a wide variety of innovative
interactive television services and applications.

Broadband Services.

During 2002, we formed an agreement with EarthLink,
one of the nation’s largest Internet service providers, to combine DISH Network
satellite television service with EarthLink’s DSL Internet



access capabilities and offer bundled service packages to consumers. We
began offering these services in 2003. In addition, during 2002, SBC
Communications Inc. began offering a bundled discount to new subscribers who
subscribe to both SBC’s DSL package and our qualified programming packages.

Satellites

Overview of Our Satellites.

We presently have eight direct broadcast
satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator.
Our satellites are located in orbital positions, or slots, that are designated
by their western longitude. An orbital position describes both a physical
location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band. The
FCC has divided each DBS orbital position into 32 direct broadcast satellite
frequency channels. Each transponder on our satellites can exploit one
frequency channel. Through digital compression technology, we can currently
transmit between eight and ten digital video channels from each transponder, on
average. The FCC licensed us to operate 96 direct broadcast satellite
frequencies at various orbital positions including:

•

21 frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location and 29
frequencies at the 110 degree orbital location, both capable of
providing service to the entire continental United States;

•

11 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location, capable
of providing service to the Eastern and Central United States;

•

24 frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location, capable of
providing service to the Western United States;

•

11 additional as yet unassigned frequencies in the “western
arc,” which refers to orbital locations between 148 degrees and 175
degrees. See “— Government regulation.”

EchoStar I and EchoStar II each have 16 transponders that operate at 130
watts of power. Subject to the anomalies described below, EchoStar III and
EchoStar IV each have 32 transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts
per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per
channel. EchoStar V has 32 transponders that operate at approximately 110 watts
per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at approximately 220 watts
per channel. Each of EchoStar VI, EchoStar VII and EchoStar VIII has 32
transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to
16 transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel. EchoStar VII
and EchoStar VIII also include spot-beam technology. The use of spot-beams on
EchoStar VII and EchoStar VIII enables us to increase the number of markets
where we provide local channels, but reduces the number of video channels that
could otherwise be offered across the entire United States. Each transponder
can transmit multiple digital video, audio and data channels. Each of our
satellites has a minimum design life of 12 years.

Our primary orbital slots are the 110 and 119 degree orbital locations.
We currently broadcast the majority of our programming from these locations.
The majority of our customers have satellite receiver systems that are equipped
to receive signals from both of these locations.

EchoStar VII commenced operation at the 119 degree orbital location during
April 2002. EchoStar VIII commenced operation at the 110 degree orbital
location during October 2002.

Satellite Anomalies.

During January 2002, a transponder pair on EchoStar
III failed, resulting in a temporary interruption of service. The operation of
the satellite was quickly restored. Including five transponders pairs that
malfunctioned in prior years, these anomalies have resulted in the failure of a
total of 12 transponders on the satellite to date. While a maximum of 32
transponders can be operated at any time, the satellite was equipped with a
total of 44 transponders to provide redundancy. In addition, we are only
licensed by the FCC to operate 11 transponders at the 61.5 degree orbital
location (together with an additional six leased transponders). We will
continue to evaluate the performance of EchoStar III.

As a result of the failure of EchoStar IV solar arrays to fully deploy and
the failure of 38 transponders to date, a maximum of 6 of the 44 transponders
(including spares) on EchoStar IV are available for use at this time. In
addition



to transponder and solar array failures, EchoStar IV experienced anomalies
affecting its thermal systems and propulsion system. Consequently, the
estimated total remaining useful life of EchoStar IV is two to three years.
There can be no assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of
use, of EchoStar IV will not occur in the immediate future. Currently no
programming is being transmitted to customers on EchoStar IV, and the satellite
functions as an in-orbit spare.

During 2000 and 2001, EchoStar V experienced anomalies resulting in the
loss of two solar array strings, and during August 2002, EchoStar V experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array string. The
satellite has a total of approximately 96 solar array strings and approximately
92 are required to assure full power availability for the estimated 12-year
design life of the satellite. In addition, during January 2003, EchoStar V
experienced an anomaly in a spacecraft electronic component which affects the
ability to receive telemetry from certain on-board equipment. Other methods of
communication have been established to alleviate the effects of the failed
component. An investigation of the solar array and electronic component
anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the satellite,
is continuing. Until the root cause of these anomalies is finally determined,
there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses which
could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

During 2001, EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of
two solar array strings, and during July 2002, EchoStar VI experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array string. The
satellite has a total of approximately 112 solar array strings and
approximately 106 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year design life of the satellite. An investigation of the solar
array anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the
satellite, is continuing. Until the root cause of these anomalies is finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

During September and October 2002, two of the thrusters on EchoStar VIII
experienced anomalous events and are not currently in use. The satellite is
equipped with a total of 12 thrusters that help control spacecraft location,
attitude, and pointing and is currently operating using a combination of the
other 10 thrusters. This workaround requires more frequent maneuvers to
maintain the satellite at its specified orbital location, which are less
efficient and therefore result in accelerated fuel use. In addition, the
workaround will require certain gyroscopes to be utilized for aggregate periods
of time in excess of their originally qualified limits. However, neither of
these workarounds are expected to significantly reduce the estimated 12-year
design life of the satellite. An investigation of the thruster anomalies
including the development of additional workarounds for long term operations is
continuing. None of these events has impacted commercial operation of the
satellite to date. Until the root cause of these anomalies has been finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

Certain Risks to Our Satellites.

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat
to all in orbit geosynchronous satellites including EchoStar’s DBS satellites.
While the probability that our satellites will be damaged by meteoroids is very
small, that probability increases significantly when the Earth passes through
the particulate stream left behind by various comets.

Occasionally, increased solar activity poses a potential threat to all
in-orbit geosynchronous satellites including EchoStar’s direct broadcast
satellites. The probability that the effects from this activity will damage our
satellites or cause service interruptions is generally very small.

Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass
through the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to
operational spacecraft including EchoStar’s direct broadcast satellites. The
locations of these hazards are generally well known and may require EchoStar to
perform maneuvers to avoid collisions.

Satellites under Construction.

EchoStar IX, which is expected to operate
at the 121 degree orbital location, is being manufactured by Space
Systems/Loral. EchoStar IX will be capable of operating 32 Ku-band
transponders at 110 watts each, in addition to a Ka-band payload. EchoStar IX
is currently expected to be used for expanded DISH Network service such as
video and other services. The Ka-band portion will be used to test and verify



potential future broadband initiatives and to initiate those services.
Echo IX is expected to be put in service prior to December 2003.

Satellite Insurance.

The launch and/or in-orbit insurance policies for
EchoStar I through EchoStar VIII have expired. We have been unable to obtain
insurance on any of these satellites on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we
are currently self-insuring these satellites. To satisfy insurance covenants
related to EDBS’ senior notes, we have reclassified an amount equal to the
depreciated cost of four of our satellites from cash and cash equivalents to
cash reserved for satellite insurance on our balance sheet. As of December 31,
2002, cash reserved for satellite insurance totaled approximately $151 million.
The reclassifications will continue until such time, if ever, as we can again
insure our satellites on acceptable terms and for acceptable amounts, or until
the covenants requiring the insurance are no longer applicable. We believe we
have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously recover
transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites
fails. However, the cash reserved for satellite insurance is not adequate to
fund the construction, launch and insurance for a replacement satellite in the
event of a complete loss of a satellite. Programming continuity cannot be
assured in the event of multiple satellite losses.

In September 1998, we filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a total
loss under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The insurance
carriers offered us a total of approximately $88 million, or 40% of the total
policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance claim. We are
currently in arbitration with the insurers regarding this claim. See “Item 3 –
Legal Proceedings.”

Components of a DBS System

Overview.

In order to provide programming services to DISH Network
subscribers, we have entered into agreements with video, audio and data
programmers, who deliver their programming content to our digital broadcast
operations centers in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona, via commercial
satellites, fiber optic networks or microwave transmissions. We monitor those
signals for quality, and can add promotional messages, public service
programming, advertising, or other information. Equipment at our digital
broadcast operations centers then digitizes, compresses, encrypts and combines
the signal with other necessary data, such as conditional access information.
We then “uplink” or transmit the signals to one or more of our direct broadcast
satellites where we then broadcast directly to DISH Network subscribers.

In order to receive DISH Network programming, a subscriber needs:

•

a satellite antenna, which people sometimes refer to as a
“dish,” and related components;

•

an integrated receiver/decoder, which people sometimes refer
to as a “satellite receiver” or “set-top box”; and

•

a television set.

Set-top boxes communicate with our authorization center through telephone
lines to, among other things, report the purchase of pay-per-view movies and
other events.

EchoStar Receiver Systems.

EchoStar receiver systems include a small
satellite dish, a digital satellite receiver that decrypts and decompresses
signals for television viewing, a remote control, and other related components.
We offer a number of set-top box models. Our standard system comes with an
infrared universal remote control, an on-screen interactive program guide and
V-chip type technology for parental control. Our premium model includes a hard
disk drive enabling additional features such as personal video recording of up
to 90 hours of programming, a UHF/infrared universal remote, and an expansion
port for future upgradeability. We also offer a variety of specialized products
such as HDTV receivers. DISH Network reception equipment is incompatible with
competitors’ systems in the United States.

Although we internally design and engineer our receiver systems, we
outsource manufacturing to high-volume contract electronics manufacturers.
Sanmina-SCI Corporation (formerly known as SCI Systems, Inc.), a high-volume
contract electronics manufacturer, is the primary manufacturer of our receiver
systems. JVC also manufacturers some of our receiver systems. In addition,
during January 2002, we signed an agreement with



Thomson multimedia, S.A., a French company, to manufacture DISH Network
compatible satellite TV receivers under the RCA brand name.

Conditional Access System.

We use conditional access technology to encrypt
the programming so only those who pay can receive the programming. We use
microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, or “smart cards” to
control access to authorized programming content. ECC owns 50% of NagraStar
LLC, a joint venture that provides us with smart cards. Nagra USA owns the
other 50% of NagraStar. NagraStar purchases these smart cards from NagraCard
SA, a Swiss company which is the parent of Nagra USA. These smart cards, which
we can update or replace periodically, are a key element in preserving the
security of our conditional access system. When a consumer orders a particular
channel, we send a message by satellite that instructs the smart card to permit
decryption of the programming for viewing by that consumer. The set-top box
then decompresses the programming and sends it to the consumer’s television.

The delivery of subscription programming requires the use of encryption
technology to assure that only those who pay can receive programming. It is
illegal to create, sell or otherwise distribute mechanisms or devices to
circumvent that encryption. Theft of subscription television programming has
been widely reported and our signal encryption has been pirated and could be
further compromised in the future. Theft of our programming reduces future
potential revenue and increases our net subscriber acquisition costs. In
addition, theft of our competitors’ programming can also increase our churn.
We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security
measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult.
However there can be no assurance that these security measures or any future
security measures we may implement will be effective in reducing piracy of our
programming signals. Compromises of our encryption technology could, among
other things, adversely affect our ability to contract for video and audio
services provided by programmers.

Installation.

While many consumers have the skills necessary to install
our equipment in their homes, we believe that most installations are best
performed by professionals, and that on time, quality installations are
important to our success. Consequently, we have expanded our installation
business, which is conducted through our DISH Network Service Corporation
subsidiary. In addition to expanding our internal installation capability, we
also utilize independent installation providers. Independent installers are
held to DISH Network Service Corporation service standards to attempt to ensure
each DISH Network customer receives the same quality installation and service.
Our offices and independent installers are strategically located throughout the
continental United States, in order to enable us to provide service to a
greater number of DISH Network customers throughout the country. Although there
can be no assurance, we believe that our installation business will help to
improve quality control, decrease wait time on service calls and new
installations and help us to better accommodate anticipated subscriber growth.

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers.

Our principal digital broadcast
operations center is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1999, we acquired a
second digital broadcast operations center in Gilbert, Arizona. During 2000, we
completed the first phase of the “build-out” of the Gilbert facility for use as
a back up for our main digital broadcast operations center in Cheyenne. In
order to comply with “must-carry” rules, effective January 1, 2002 (see
“-Government Regulation”), we began utilizing the Gilbert facility as an
additional digital broadcast operations center. With the commercial operation
of our EchoStar VII and EchoStar VIII satellites, we expanded the role of the
Gilbert facility. Almost all of the functions necessary to provide
satellite-delivered services occur at the digital broadcast operations centers.
The digital broadcast operations centers use fiber optic lines and downlink
antennas to receive programming and other data. The digital broadcast
operations centers then uplink programming content to our direct broadcast
satellites via large uplink antennas. Equipment at our digital broadcast
operations centers performs substantially all compression and all encryption of
the DISH Network’s programming signals.

Customer Service Centers.

We currently own and operate customer service
centers in seven United States locations. These centers field substantially all
of our customer service calls. Potential and existing subscribers can call a
single telephone number to receive assistance for hardware, programming,
billing, installation and technical support. We continue to work to automate
simple phone responses and to increase Internet-based customer assistance in
order to better manage customer service costs.

Subscriber Management.

We presently use, and are dependent on, CSG Systems
International Inc.’s software system for the majority of DISH Network
subscriber billing and related functions.



Competition for Our Dish Network Business

The subscription television service industry is highly competitive. We
compete against a variety of established and newer, innovative companies that
offer services and programming similar to or in addition to our own, including
video, audio and interactive programming, telephony, broadband
Internet, and
other data and entertainment services. These competitors include cable
television and wireless companies, other DBS operators and companies that are
developing new technologies. Many of these competitors have substantially
greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our ability to
compete with these companies will depend on our ability to match or outperform
them in several of the following key areas: quality and variety of video, audio
and interactive programming, quality of picture, pricing, customer service,
access to service, and availability of related services such as broadband
Internet, telephony, and other data and entertainment services.

Cable Television

. Cable television operators are a source of significant
competition for us and they benefit from several competitive advantages we do
not possess. First, many cable companies have customer bases that are larger
and more firmly established than our customer base. Of the 97% of U.S.
television households in which cable television service is currently available,
approximately 69% currently subscribe to cable. In addition, many cable
operators also have significant investments in companies that provide
programming content. These investments may give them an advantage over us in
access to quality programming. Finally, cable operators already provide local
programming in substantially all geographic areas they serve.

Cable operators also enjoy certain competitive advantages inherent in
cable television technology. For example, cable companies are able to provide
analog service to multiple television sets within the same household at an
incremental cost to the consumer that is lower than our cost to service
multiple sets. Cable companies are also investing heavily in new digital
technologies that allow them to bundle traditional analog video offerings with
expanded high-quality digital video and other services, such as two-way
high-speed Internet access and telephone services. These bundled services may
be attractive to consumers due to discounting of the bundled services and the
fact that the consumer receives a single bill. We may have difficulty
competing effectively against cable television operators because of these
competitive advantages and our business could be adversely affected as a
result.

DirecTV and other DBS and Direct-to-Home System Operators.

Our primary
DBS competitor is DirecTV. DirecTV has launched seven high-powered direct
broadcast satellites and has 46 direct broadcast satellite frequencies that are
capable of full coverage of the continental United States. DirecTV has stated
that it currently offers approximately 800 digital-quality video and audio
channels and, as of December 31, 2002, had approximately 11.2 million
subscribers. We believe that DirecTV has been and could continue to be in an
advantageous position relative to us with regard to certain programming
packages, provision of local programming and, possibly, the ability to offer
volume discounts for programming offers. In addition, the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative, which is affiliated with DirecTV, competes with
us in certain territories through its members and affiliates.

DirecTV also has a highly-developed sales and distribution system. Its
satellite receivers are sold in a significantly greater number of consumer
electronics stores than ours. As a result of these and other factors, and
since we typically do less national advertising than DirecTV, our receivers and
programming services are less well known to consumers than those of DirecTV.
Due to this relative lack of consumer awareness and other factors, we are at a
competitive marketing disadvantage compared to DirecTV.

In addition, other companies in the United States have or are applying for
conditional permits or have leased transponders for direct broadcast satellite
assignments that can be used to provide service to portions of the United
States in competition with us. Also, the FCC has proposed to allocate
additional expansion spectrum for direct broadcast satellite services, which
could create significant additional competition in the market for subscription
television services. Moreover, as evidenced by a recent application filed at
the FCC, direct broadcast satellite service providers may seek and receive
authority to service the United States market from full-CONUS slots allocated
to other nations, particularly where such nations have entered into bilateral
agreements with the United States. Other competitors include C-Band satellite
providers and overlay services, which are particularly competitive in rural
areas. Finally, one company has applied to the FCC for permission to serve the
United States with DBS service from an orbital location midway



between the 110 degree orbital location and the 101 degree orbital
location. In summary, if the number of DBS operators increases in the future,
or if the number of DBS frequency assignments to our existing DBS competitors
increases, our business could be adversely affected.

VHF/UHF Broadcasters.

Most areas of the United States can receive
traditional terrestrial VHF/UHF television broadcasts of between 3 and 10
channels. These broadcasters provide local, network and syndicated
programming. The local content nature of the programming may be important to
the consumer, and VHF/UHF programming is typically provided free of charge. In
addition, the FCC has allocated additional digital spectrum to licensed
broadcasters. At least during a transition period, each existing television
station will be able to retain its present analog frequencies and also transmit
programming on a digital channel that may permit multiple programming services
per channel. Our business could be adversely affected by continued free
broadcast of local and other programming and increased program offerings by
traditional broadcasters.

New Technologies.

New technologies also could have a material adverse
effect on the demand for our direct broadcast satellite services. For example,
new and advanced local multi-point distribution services are currently being
implemented. In addition, entities such as regional telephone companies, which
are likely to have greater resources than we have, are implementing and
supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines and digital
“wireless cable.” Moreover, mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among
franchise, wireless or private cable television operators, regional Bell
operating companies and others may result in the creation of additional
providers capable of offering bundled cable television and telecommunications
services in competition with us. We may not be able to compete successfully
with existing competitors or new entrants in the market for subscription
television services.

ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

EchoStar Technologies Corporation (“ETC”), one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, internally designs and develops EchoStar receiver systems. Our
satellite receivers have won numerous awards from the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association, retailers, and industry trade publications. We
outsource the manufacture of EchoStar receiver systems to third parties who
manufacture the receivers in accordance with our specifications.

We created our ETC division in connection with the development of the DISH
Network. However, in addition to supplying EchoStar receiver systems for the
DISH Network, ETC also sells similar digital satellite receivers
internationally, either directly to television service operators or to our
independent distributors worldwide. This has created a source of additional
business for us and synergies that directly benefit DISH Network. For example,
our satellite receivers are designed around the Digital Video Broadcasting
standard, which is widely used in Europe and Asia. The same employees who
design EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network are also involved in
designing set-top boxes sold to international TV customers. Consequently, we
benefit from the possibility that ETC’s international projects may result in
improvements in design and economies of scale in the production of EchoStar
receiver systems for the DISH Network.

We believe that direct-to-home satellite service is particularly
well-suited for countries without extensive cable infrastructure, and we are
actively soliciting new business for ETC. However, there can be no assurance
that ETC will be able to develop additional international business or maintain
its existing customers.

Through 2002, our primary international customer was Bell ExpressVu, a
subsidiary of Bell Canada, Canada’s national telephone company. We currently
have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu, and we are actively
trying to secure new orders from other potential international customers.
However, we cannot guarantee at this time that those negotiations will be
successful. Our future international revenue depends largely on the success of
these and other international operators, which in turn, depends on other
factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of direct-to-home satellite
TV products and the increasing intensity of competition for international
subscription television subscribers.

ETC’s business also includes our Atlanta-based EchoStar Data Networks
Corporation and our UK-based Eldon Technology Limited subsidiaries. EchoStar
Data Networks is a supplier of technology for distributing Internet and other
content over satellite networks. Eldon Technology designs and tests various
software and other technology



used in digital televisions and set-top boxes, strengthening our product
design capabilities for satellite receivers and integrated televisions in both
the international and United States markets.

Competition for Our ETC Business

Through ETC we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic
companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, financial or
otherwise, than we have. We expect new competitors to enter this market because
of rapidly changing technology. Our ability to anticipate these technological
changes and introduce enhanced products expeditiously will be a significant
factor in our ability to remain competitive. We do not know if we will be able
to successfully introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis in
order to remain competitive.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Communications
Corporation, or FCC. To a more limited extent we are also subject to
regulation by other federal agencies, state and local authorities and the
International Telecommunications Union, or ITU.

Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or
regulations promulgated by these entities could result in suspension or
revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the termination or loss of
contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal
penalties.

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is not
intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and
legislation affecting the video programming distribution industry. Government
regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative
proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change our
industry to varying degrees. We cannot predict either the outcome of these
proceedings or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our
operations.

FCC Regulation Under the Communications Act

FCC Jurisdiction.

The Federal Communications Act of 1934, referred to as
the Communications Act, established the FCC and gave the agency broad authority
to regulate the use of the radio spectrum. We transmit our programming to and
from satellites using radio frequencies in a portion of this spectrum. The FCC
grants us licenses to use those frequencies and assigns the locations in space
where we are authorized to operate our satellites. More specifically, the
Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over the following
areas relating to DBS operations:

The FCC grants licenses and related authorizations to DBS operators that
meet its legal, technical and financial qualification requirements. These
licenses and authorizations are subject to numerous conditions imposed by the
FCC, including, among other things, satisfaction of ongoing due diligence
obligations, construction milestones, reporting and other requirements. In
addition, the FCC must grant approval for the relocation of satellites to
different orbital locations or the replacement of an existing satellite with a
new satellite.

Our Basic DBS Frequency Licenses and Authorizations.

We currently have
the following FCC DBS licenses: a license to use 21 frequencies at the 119
degree orbital location, which expires in 2006; licenses to operate 29
frequencies at the 110 degree orbital location, which we expect to expire in
2009; and a license to operate 11 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital
location, which expires in 2008. We also have an authorization to use 24
frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location. This authorization was granted
subject to the condition that we utilize all allocated frequencies at that
location by December 20, 2002 or



risk losing those frequencies that we are not
using. While we believe we have fulfilled this requirement, the FCC has not
confirmed that we are in compliance with this condition.

We also sublease six transponders (corresponding to six frequencies) at
the 61.5 degree orbital location from licensee Dominion, and we have special
temporary authority for another 13 frequencies at that location. However, this
special temporary authority is subject to several restrictive conditions and
there can be no assurance that the FCC will renew it. Moreover, The FCC
recently extended the permit of another company to construct and launch a
satellite that would use most of these additional frequencies. If our special
temporary authority to use these frequencies does not otherwise expire, it will
be terminated in the event that company constructs and launches a satellite to
the 61.5 degree orbital location.

We currently operate EchoStar IV and EchoStar VII at the 119 degree
orbital location. We operate EchoStar V, EchoStar VI and EchoStar VIII at the
110 degree orbital location, but we are in the process of moving EchoStar V to
the 119 degree orbital location. We operate EchoStar III at the 61.5 degree
orbital location and EchoStar I and II at the 148 degree orbital location.
While we have received temporary authority, the FCC has not yet granted us
permanent authority to operate EchoStar II, EchoStar V or EchoStar VI at the
locations described above, since those locations differ from those originally
assigned. There can be no assurance the FCC will grant those permanent
authorities, certain of which have been opposed by other parties. Our failure
to receive authority for these modifications could have a material adverse
effect on our business or financial performance.

We also have a conditional authorization and construction permit for 11
DBS frequencies at unspecified western orbital locations. In accordance with
FCC requests, we recently identified our preferred orbital locations for these
frequencies. The FCC has not yet issued a final ruling on where we may use
these frequencies.

Our DBS licenses have ten year terms, shorter than the useful life of a
healthy direct broadcast satellite. Generally speaking, all of our licenses
are subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC, and our special temporary
authorizations are granted for periods of 180 days or less, subject again to
possible renewal by the FCC. Moreover, several third parties have opposed, and
we expect them to continue to oppose, some of our authorizations and pending
and future requests to the FCC for extensions, modifications, waivers and
approvals of our licenses. In addition, we have not filed, or have not timely
filed, certain reports required in connection with our authorizations. The FCC
could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to extend or renew such
authorizations if we fail to comply with applicable Communications Act
requirements.

Ka-Band, Ku-Band and Extended Ku-Band Licenses.

We have received
conditional licenses from the FCC to operate satellites in the Ka-band and the
Ku-band, and we have an application pending for a system that would use
extended Ku-band frequencies (although that application has remained pending
for many years). Use of those licenses and conditional authorizations is
subject to certain technical and due diligence requirements, including the
requirement to construct and launch satellites according to specific milestones
and deadlines. Our projects to construct and launch Ku-band, extended Ku-band
and Ka-band satellites are in various stages of development. EchoStar IX, a
hybrid Ku/Ka/C-band satellite to be located at the 121 degree orbital location,
is expected to launch during the first half of 2003. Some companies with
interests adverse to ours are challenging our licenses, including our
conditional license for a Ku-band satellite system at the 83 and 121 degree
orbital locations, which is subject to pending petitions for reconsideration
and cancellation.

We cannot be certain that the FCC will sustain any of these licenses, that
it will grant the pending applications, or that we will be able to successfully
capitalize on any resulting business opportunities. In addition, the
construction, completion and launch milestones for both Ku-band satellites have
expired. We have filed a timely request for the extension of these milestones
for our Ku-band system, but there can be no assurance this extension will be
granted. With respect to our license for the Ka-band system at the 83 and 121
degree orbital locations, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation
of the satellite system



to be completed by June 25, 2005. The FCC has stated
that it may cancel our corresponding authorizations if we fail to file adequate
reports or to demonstrate progress in the construction of that satellite
system.

We also own a 90% interest in VisionStar, Inc., (“VisionStar”) which holds
a Ka-band license at the 113 degree orbital location. We did not complete
construction or launch of the satellite by the milestone deadlines and have
requested an extension of these milestones from the FCC. Failure to receive an
extension, of which there can be no assurance, will render the license invalid.

Rules Relating to Alaska and Hawaii.

The holders of DBS authorizations
issued after January 19, 1996 must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii
where such service is technically feasible from the authorized orbital
location, and must provide programming packages reasonably comparable to those
offered to the 48 contiguous United States. Our authorizations at the 110
degree orbital location and the 148 degree orbital location were both received
after January 19, 1996. While we provide service to Alaska and Hawaii from
both the 110 and 119 degree orbital locations, those states have expressed the
view our service should more closely resemble our service to the mainland
United States, and otherwise needs improvement. Further, the satellites we
currently operate at the 148 degree orbital location are not able to provide
service to Alaska and Hawaii. We have received temporary waivers of the
service requirement for the 148 degree orbital location subject to several
conditions. Alaska and Hawaii have requested, and it is possible that the FCC
could impose, additional conditions which we could not meet in connection with
our request to permanently operate EchoStar I and EchoStar II at that location.

Other In-Orbit Authorizations.

The telemetry, tracking and control
operations of EchoStar I use the C-band radio frequencies. Although the FCC
granted us conditional authority to use these frequencies for telemetry,
tracking and control, in January 1996, a foreign government raised an objection
to EchoStar I’s use of these frequencies. We cannot be certain whether that
objection will subsequently require us to relinquish the use of such C-band
frequencies for telemetry, tracking and control purposes. Further, EchoStar
II’s telemetry, tracking and control operations are in the “extended” C-band
radio frequencies. Our authorization to use these frequencies expired on
January 1, 1999. Although we have timely applied for extension of that
authorization to November 2006, we cannot be sure that the FCC will grant our
request. If we lose the ability to use these frequencies for control of these
satellites, we would not be able to use them for broadcast operations at these
locations. Recently, the FCC released a ruling that will allow commercial
terrestrial services and hamper future satellite operations in the “extended”
C-band frequencies. This ruling might have negative implications for us. Also,
our request to operate EchoStar II at the 148 degree orbital location includes
a request to use the extended C-band for telemetry, tracking and control at
that orbital location. We cannot be sure that the FCC will grant that request.

Certain Other Communications Act Provisions

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services.

The FCC imposes different rules for
“subscription” and “broadcast” services. We believe that because we offer a
subscription programming service, we are not subject to many of the regulatory
obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees. However, we cannot be certain
whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory
obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we
be treated as a broadcaster. If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast
licensee, it could require us to comply with all regulatory obligations imposed
upon broadcast licensees, which are generally subject to more burdensome
regulation than subscription television service providers like us.

Under a requirement of the Cable Act, the FCC imposed public interest
requirements on direct broadcast satellite licensees, such as us, to set aside
four percent of channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial programming for
which we must charge programmers below-cost rates and for which we may not
impose additional charges on subscribers. This could displace programming for
which we could earn commercial rates and could adversely affect our financial
results.

The FCC has commenced an inquiry into distribution of high-speed Internet
access services and a rulemaking concerning interactive television services. In
these proceedings, the FCC is considering whether to impose on distributors,
including satellite distributors like us, various types of “open access”



obligations (such as required carriage of independent content providers). We
cannot be sure that the FCC will not ultimately impose such obligations, which
could be very onerous and could create a significant strain on our capacity and
ability to provide other services.

Foreign Ownership Restrictions.

The Communications Act imposes certain
foreign ownership restrictions on licensees of radio spectrum, including
licensees of satellite services. The FCC has ruled that most of these foreign
ownership restrictions do not apply to DBS services, but some of these
restrictions remain applicable. For example, a DBS license may not be held by
a foreign government or representative of a foreign government. In addition,
it is possible that the FCC could revisit its interpretation of DBS foreign
ownership requirements in future proceedings.

Certain Other Rulemakings.

The FCC recently proposed to allocate
additional “expansion” spectrum for direct broadcast satellite operators
starting in 2007. We filed an application to use those expansion frequencies on
March 28, 2002. There can be no assurance that the FCC will grant our
application to use these expansion frequencies.

Foreign satellite systems also are potential providers of direct broadcast
satellite service within the United States. There is a risk that the FCC will
allow the U.S market to be served by a foreign licensee and this could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

The FCC has adopted a proposal to allow non-geostationary orbit fixed
satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency as
DBS and Ku-based FSS services. In the same rulemaking, the FCC authorized use
of the same direct broadcast satellite spectrum that we use by another
terrestrial consumer service originally proposed by Northpoint Technology, Ltd.
There can be no assurance these additional operations in the DBS spectrum will
not interfere with our operations.

On February 28, 2002, the FCC initiated a proceeding to examine and revise
its licensing process for orbital locations or spectrum used for the provision
of international or global satellite communications services. The extent to
which any change in the satellite licensing process could affect us is unclear.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act

The Copyright Act, as amended by the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement
Act, permits satellite retransmission of distant network channels only to
“unserved households.” Whether a household qualifies as “unserved” for the
purpose of eligibility to receive a distant network channel depends, in part,
on whether that household can receive a signal of “Grade B intensity” as
defined by the FCC. If the FCC adopts an overly restrictive regulatory
definition of “Grade B,” our ability to retransmit distant network channels
would be adversely affected.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act also established a process
whereby consumers predicted to be served by a local broadcast station may
request that the station waive the unserved household limitation so that the
requesting consumer may receive distant signals by satellite. If the waiver
request is denied, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act permits the
consumer to request an actual test in certain circumstances. Certain parties
have argued in some cases that we should be responsible for testing costs,
which could be substantial. The FCC staff has informally raised questions about
how we implement the testing process.

In addition, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act could adversely
affect us in several other respects. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act
prohibits us from providing individual customers with more than two distant
signals for each broadcasting network. Although we have implemented certain
measures in our effort to comply with the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement
Act, these requirements have hampered, and may further hamper, our ability to
retransmit distant network and superstation signals, and the burdens from the
rules upon us may become so onerous that we may be required to substantially
alter, or stop retransmitting, many or all superstation signals. In addition,
the FCC’s sports blackout requirements, which apply to all distant network
signals, may require costly upgrades to our system.



Retransmission Consents.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act
generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit
local broadcast channels, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of
the local station. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with
broadcasters who elect retransmission consents instead of mandatory “must
carry” carriage, then we cannot carry these broadcasters’ signals. Any
inability on our part to carry local channels could have an adverse effect on
our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that already
provide local channels to their customers.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and related FCC rules require
broadcasters to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. If
broadcasters fail to negotiate with satellite operators in good faith, the
rules allow the satellite operators to file complaints against those
broadcasters with the FCC. While we have been able to reach retransmission
consent agreements with most of the local network stations we currently carry,
any additional roll-out of local channels in other cities will require new
agreements, and we cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that
we will be able to renew existing agreements, some of which are short term
agreements, upon their expiration.

“Must Carry” and Other Requirements.

Many other provisions of the
Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act could adversely affect us. Among other
things, the law includes the imposition of “must carry” requirements on DBS
providers. The FCC has implemented that requirement and adopted detailed “must
carry” rules covering both commercial and non-commercial broadcast stations.
These rules require that satellite distributors that carry any broadcaster in a
given market must carry in a timely and appropriate manner all of the local
broadcast stations in that market requesting carriage. Since we have limited
satellite capacity and many stations in each market we serve elect “must
carry,” the number of markets in which we can offer local programming is
reduced by the “must carry” requirement. Several broadcasters have filed “must
carry” complaints against us at the FCC and we do not know whether the FCC will
rule against us in those proceedings. It is possible the FCC could require us
to carry many additional stations in the markets where we offer local stations.

In addition, we do not know whether the FCC will prohibit or restrict our
“must carry” compliance procedures. Currently, in most of the markets where we
provide local broadcast signals, subscribers must use a second dish antenna to
receive all of their local broadcast stations carried on our system. We
provide such second dishes free of any charge, in accordance with the “must
carry” statute and rules. The National Association of Broadcasters and
Association of Local Television Stations filed an emergency petition on January
4, 2002 asking the FCC to prohibit or restrict this 2-dish method. On April 4,
2002, the Media Bureau of the FCC issued a declaratory ruling and order finding
that our compliance plan violated certain provisions of the Satellite Home
Viewer Improvement Act and the FCC’s “must carry” regulations. The April 4
order recommended several ways we could come into compliance and required us to
file compliance reports within 30 days, 90 days and 150 days of the order’s
issuance, all of which we filed. Challenges to the April 4 order have been
filed by various parties, including us, and are presently pending. On April 15,
2002, the bureau issued an order granting in part numerous complaints filed
against us by individual broadcast stations that claimed violations of the
“must carry” requirements similar to those addressed in the April 4 order. The
April 15 order also required us to submit a compliance report within 30 days,
which we filed. While several broadcasters have attempted to force us through
“must carry” complaints to implement a single-dish solution, the FCC has to
date declined to force us to implement such a solution.

Depending upon the ultimate outcome of these proceedings (including the
extent to which our compliance reports are accepted), further orders by the
bureau or by the FCC itself could require that we reduce the number of local
markets where we offer local network programming. This, in turn, could
significantly increase our subscriber churn in those areas where local network
programming is no longer offered and impair our ability to gain new subscribers
in those areas. We could also be exposed to court actions under the “must
carry” rules and may be subject to damage claims if we are found by any court
to have violated the “must carry” requirements.

Finally, even though the FCC has decided for now not to impose dual
digital/analog carriage obligations — i.e., requiring us to carry a station’s
digital broadcast signal in addition to its analog one— the FCC has issued a
further notice of proposed rulemaking on this matter. We cannot be sure that
this



rulemaking will not result in further, more onerous, digital carriage
requirements, particularly if the FCC mandates high-definition carriage of
digital signals.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act also includes provisions which
could expose us to material monetary penalties and permanent prohibitions on
the sale of all local and distant network channels in the event we violate
provisions of that act, prior law or other FCC rules. Imposition of these
penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
performance.

Opposition to Our Delivery of Distant Signals

Until July 1998, we obtained distant broadcast network channels (ABC, NBC,
CBS and FOX) for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24. In
December 1998, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida entered a nationwide permanent injunction requiring PrimeTime 24 to
shut off distant network channels to many of its customers, and henceforth to
sell those channels to consumers in accordance with certain stipulations in the
injunction.

In December 1998, the networks filed a motion for a preliminary injunction
directly against us. In September 2000, the District Court granted this motion
and made several amendments to it. The injunction required us to terminate
distant network programming to certain of our subscribers. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stayed the injunction pending our
appeal. In September 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit vacated the District Court’s injunction, finding, among other things,
that it was too broad and remanded the case back to the District Court for an
evidentiary hearing. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit also rejected our argument that the “unserved households” restriction
of the law is unconstitutional, and the United States Supreme Court declined to
review that decision. If after the trial or an evidentiary hearing the
injunction is reinstated, it could force us to terminate delivery of distant
network channels to a substantial portion of our distant network subscriber
base. This could cause many of these subscribers to cancel their subscription
to our other services. Such terminations would result in a small reduction in
our reported average monthly revenue per subscriber and could result in a
temporary increase in churn. If we lose the case at trial, the judge could,
among other remedies, prohibit all future sales of distant network programming
by us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In order,
among other things, to plan for the potential re-implementation of the
injunction, we may terminate the delivery of distant network channels to
certain subscribers.

Dependence on Cable Act for Program Access

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from programmers
that are affiliated with the cable system operators. Current program access law
prohibits such programmers from refusing to sell us their content and imposes
certain pricing restrictions on them. Any relaxation of these requirements
could adversely affect our ability to acquire programming at all or to acquire
programming on a cost-effective basis.

We believe that the FCC generally has not shown a willingness to enforce
the program access rules strictly. As a result, we may be limited in our
ability to obtain access (or non-discriminatory access) to programming from
programmers that are affiliated with the cable system operators.

The International Telecommunication Union

ITU Standards.

Our direct broadcast satellite system also must conform to
the ITU broadcasting satellite service plan. If any of our operations are not
consistent with this plan, the ITU will only provide authorization on a
non-interference basis pending successful modification of the plan or the
agreement of all affected administrations to the non-conforming operations.
Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its broadcasting satellite
service plan to include the technical parameters of direct broadcast



satellite
applicants’ operations, our satellites, along with those of other direct
broadcast satellite operators, must not cause harmful electrical interference
with other assignments that are in conformance with the plan. Further, direct
broadcast satellites are not presently entitled to any protection from other
satellites that are in conformance with the plan. We believe the United States
government has filed modification requests
with the ITU for EchoStar I, EchoStar II and EchoStar III. The ITU has
requested certain technical information in order to process the requested
modifications. We have cooperated, and continue to cooperate, with the FCC in
the preparation of its responses to the ITU requests. We cannot predict when
the ITU will act upon these requests for modification or if they will be
granted.

Export Control Regulation

We are required to obtain import and general destination export licenses
from the United States Government to receive and deliver components of
direct-to-home satellite TV systems. In addition, the delivery of satellites
and related technical information for the purpose of launch by foreign launch
services providers is subject to strict export control and prior approval
requirements.

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the
future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or
affect products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a
court determines that one or more of our products infringes on intellectual
property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing
those products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual
property, or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing
the patent claims. If a competitor holds intellectual property rights, it may
not allow us to use its intellectual property at any price, which could
adversely affect our competitive position.

We cannot assure you that we are aware of all intellectual property rights
that our products may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in
the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office issues
a patent and, accordingly, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products
may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications. Further, it is
often not possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is
valid, absent protracted litigation.

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to
obtain intellectual property licenses or the availability and cost of any such
licenses. Those costs, and their impact on net income, could be material.
Damages in patent infringement cases may also include treble damages in certain
circumstances. To the extent that we are required to pay royalties to third
parties to whom we are not currently making payments, these increased costs of
doing business could negatively affect our liquidity and operating results. We
are currently being sued in patent infringement actions by, among others,
Starsight Telecast, Inc. and Gemstar. We cannot be certain the courts will
conclude these entities do not own the rights they claim, that our products do
not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from
these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain
such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid
infringement. See “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign
environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These
include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management.
We attempt to maintain compliance with all such requirements. We do not expect
capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in
2003 or 2004. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and
have become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance
that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future
in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

employees to be good.

Although a total of approximately 100 employees in four of our field
offices have voted to unionize, we are not currently a party to any
collective bargaining agreements. However, we are currently negotiating
collective



bargaining agreements at these offices. We also have votes pending in
two other field offices which involve approximately 65 employees.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Fee Dispute

We had a dispute regarding the contingent fee arrangement with the
attorneys who represented us in prior litigation with The News Corporation,
Ltd. In early July 2002, the parties resolved their dispute.

WIC Premium Television Ltd

During July 1998, a lawsuit was filed by WIC Premium Television Ltd., an
Alberta corporation, in the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division, against
General Instrument Corporation, HBO, Warner Communications, Inc., John Doe,
Showtime, United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc., EchoStar, and
certain EchoStar subsidiaries.

During September 1998, WIC filed another lawsuit in the Court of Queen’s
Bench of Alberta Judicial District of Edmonton against certain defendants,
including us. WIC is a company authorized to broadcast certain copyrighted
work, such as movies and concerts, to residents of Canada. WIC alleges that
the defendants engaged in, promoted, and/or allowed satellite dish equipment
from the United States to be sold in Canada and to Canadian residents and that
some of the defendants allowed and profited from Canadian residents purchasing
and viewing subscription television programming that is only authorized for
viewing in the United States. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, interim
and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from importing satellite
receivers into Canada and from activating satellite receivers located in Canada
to receive programming, together with damages in excess of $175 million.



The Court in the Alberta action denied our Motion to Dismiss, and our
appeal of that decision. The Federal action has been stayed pending the
outcome of the Alberta action. We intend to continue to vigorously defend the
suit. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the receipt in Canada
of programming from United States pay television providers is prohibited.
While we were not a party to that case, the ruling could aversely affect our
defense. It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the
litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, we obtained feeds of distant broadcast network channels
(ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX) for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24,
an independent third party programming provider. In December 1998, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a nationwide
permanent injunction requiring that provider to shut off distant network
channels to many of its customers, and henceforth to sell those channels to
consumers in accordance with certain stipulations in the injunction.

In October 1998, we filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC, NBC,
CBS and FOX in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
We asked the Court to enter judgment declaring that our method of providing
distant network programming did not violate the Satellite Home Viewer Act and
hence did not infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November 1998, the
networks and their affiliate groups filed a complaint against us in Miami
Federal Court alleging, among other things, copyright infringement. The Court
combined the case that we filed in Colorado with the case in Miami and
transferred it to the Miami Federal Court. The case remains pending in
Florida. While the networks have not sought monetary damages, they have sought
to recover attorney fees if they prevail.

In February 1999, the networks filed a “Motion for Temporary Restraining
Order, Preliminary Injunction and Contempt Finding” against DirecTV, Inc. in
Miami related to the delivery of distant network channels to DirecTV customers
by satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the networks. Under the terms
of the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV customers were
scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels
by July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by
December 31, 1999. Subsequently, substantially all providers of
satellite-delivered network programming other than us agreed to this cut-off
schedule, although we do not know if they adhered to this schedule.

In December 1998, the networks filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction
against us in the Florida case and asked the Court to enjoin us from providing
network programming except under limited circumstances. A preliminary
injunction hearing was held in September 1999. In March 2000, the networks
filed an emergency motion again asking the Court to issue an injunction
requiring us to cease providing network programming to certain of our
customers. At that time, the networks also argued that our compliance
procedures violated the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which was passed
by Congress in November 1999. We opposed the networks’ motion and again asked
the Court to hear live testimony before ruling upon the networks’ injunction
request.

During September 2000, the Court granted the networks’ motion for
preliminary injunction, denied the networks’ emergency motion, and denied our
request to present live testimony and evidence. The Court’s original order
required us to terminate network programming to certain subscribers “no later
than February 15, 1999,” and contained other dates with which it would be
physically impossible to comply. The order imposed restrictions on our past
and future sale of distant ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX channels similar to those
imposed on PrimeTime 24 (and, we believe, on DirecTV and others). Some of
those restrictions go beyond the statutory requirements imposed by the
Satellite Home Viewer Act and the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act.

Twice during October 2000, the Court amended its original preliminary
injunction order in an effort to fix some of the errors in the original order.
The twice-amended preliminary injunction order required us to shut off, by
February 15, 2001, all subscribers who were ineligible to receive distant
network programming under the Court’s order. We appealed the preliminary
injunction orders. During September 2001, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court’s nationwide preliminary
injunction, which the Eleventh Circuit had stayed in November 2000. The
Eleventh Circuit also rejected our First Amendment challenge to the Satellite
Home Viewer Act. However, the Eleventh Circuit found that the District Court
had made factual findings that were clearly erroneous and not supported by the
evidence, and that the District Court had misinterpreted and misapplied the
law. The Eleventh Circuit issued an order during January 2002 remanding the
case to the Florida District Court. During March 2002, the



Florida District Court entered an order setting the trial in the matter
for January 13, 2003 and setting a discovery and pretrial schedule. In this
order, the District Court denied certain of our outstanding motions to compel
discovery as moot and granted the networks’ motion to compel. The trial date
has now been moved to April 7, 2003. During April 2002, the District Court
denied the networks’ motion for preliminary injunction as moot. In June 2002,
we filed a counterclaim against the networks asking the District Court to find
that we are not violating the Satellite Home Viewer Act and seeking damages
resulting from the networks’ tortious interference with our business
relationships and from the networks’ conduct amounting to unfair competition.
The networks filed a motion to dismiss these claims. In August 2002, the
District Court denied the networks’ motion to dismiss. In September 2002, the
networks answered our counterclaim.

In April 2002, we reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. On
April 16, 2002, the District Court entered an order dismissing the claims
between ABC, Inc. and us. In November 2002, we reached a private settlement
with NBC, another of the plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a
stipulation of dismissal. On November 25, 2002, the District court entered an
order dismissing the claims between NBC and us. Six of the original eight
plaintiffs remain, including CBS and Fox, along with the associations
affiliated with each of the four networks. On January 28, 2003, the parties
participated in a court ordered mediation. The mediation did not resolve the
parties’ disputes. However, the parties agreed to continue the mediation and
participate in another mediation session.

If the District Court enters an injunction against us, the injunction
could force us to terminate delivery of distant network channels to a
substantial portion of our distant network subscriber base, which could also
cause many of these subscribers to cancel their subscription to our other
programming services. Any such terminations would result in a small reduction
in our reported average monthly revenue per subscriber and could result in a
temporary increase in churn. If we lose the case at trial, the judge could, as
one of many possible remedies, prohibit all future sales of distant network
programming by us, which would have a material adverse affect on our business.

Gemstar

During October 2000, Starsight Telecast, Inc., a subsidiary of Gemstar-TV
Guide International, Inc. (“Gemstar”), filed a suit for patent infringement
against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the United States District Court
for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent No. 4,706,121 (“the `121 Patent”)
which relates to certain electronic program guide functions. We have examined
this patent and believe that it is not infringed by any of our products or
services. This conclusion is supported by findings of the International Trade
Commission (“ITC”) which are discussed below. Gemstar has moved to stay the
North Carolina action pending appeal of the ITC decision. We have opposed
Gemstar’s motion.

In December 2000, we filed suit against Gemstar-TV Guide (and certain of
its subsidiaries) in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado alleging violations by Gemstar of various federal and state anti-trust
laws and laws governing unfair competition. The lawsuit seeks an injunction
and monetary damages. Gemstar filed counterclaims alleging infringement of
United States Patent Nos. 5,923,362 and 5,684,525 that relate to certain
electronic program guide functions. We examined these patents and believe they
are not infringed by any of our products or services. In August 2001, the
Federal Multi-District Litigation panel combined this suit, for pre-trial
purposes, with other lawsuits asserting antitrust claims against Gemstar, which
had previously been filed by other parties. In January 2002, Gemstar dropped
the counterclaims of patent infringement. During March 2002, the Court denied
Gemstar’s Motion to Dismiss our antitrust claims. A more recently filed motion
for summary judgment based generally on lack of standing has also been denied.
In its answer, Gemstar asserted new patent infringement counterclaims regarding
United States Patent Nos. 4,908,713 and 5,915,068 (which is expired). These
patents relate to onscreen programming of VCRs. We have examined these patents
and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or services.

In February 2001, Gemstar filed patent infringement actions against us in
the District Court in Atlanta, Georgia and with the ITC. These suits allege
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,252,066, 5,479,268 and 5,809,204,
all of which relate to certain electronic program guide functions. In
addition, the ITC action alleges infringement of the `121 Patent which is
asserted in the North Carolina case previously discussed. In the Georgia
district court case, Gemstar seeks damages and an injunction. The Georgia case
was stayed pending resolution of the ITC action and remains stayed at this
time. In December 2001, the ITC held a 15-day hearing before an administrative



law judge. Prior to the hearing, Gemstar dropped its allegations
regarding United States Patent No. 5,252,066 with respect to which we had
asserted substantial allegations of inequitable conduct. The hearing
addressed, among other things, Gemstar’s allegations of patent infringement and
respondents’ (SCI, Scientific Atlanta, Pioneer and us) allegations of patent
misuse. During June 2002, the judge issued a Final Initial Determination
finding that none of the patents asserted by Gemstar had been infringed. In
addition, the judge found that Gemstar was guilty of patent misuse with respect
to the `121 Patent and that the `121 Patent was unenforceable because it failed
to name an inventor. The parties then filed petitions for the full ITC to
review the judge’s Final Initial Determination. During August 2002, the full
ITC adopted the Judge’s findings regarding non-infringement and the
unenforceability of the `121 Patent. The ITC did not adopt, but did not
overturn, the Judge’s findings of patent misuse. Gemstar is appealing the
decision of the ITC to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. If the Federal Circuit were to overturn the Judge’s decision, such an
adverse decision in this case could temporarily halt the import of our
receivers and could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly
electronic programming guides and related features we currently offer to
consumers. Based upon our review of these patents, and based upon the ITC’s
decision, we continue to believe that these patents are not infringed by any of
our products or services. We intend to continue to vigorously contest the ITC,
North Carolina and Georgia suits and will, among other things, continue to
challenge both the validity and enforceability of the asserted patents.

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) also filed suit against us,
DirecTV and others in the United States District Court for the Western District
of North Carolina, Asheville Division, alleging infringement of United States
Patent Nos. 5,038,211, 5,293,357 and 4,751,578 which relate to certain
electronic program guide functions, including the use of electronic program
guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and declaratory relief
and damages in an unspecified amount. It is our understanding that these
patents may be licensed by Superguide to Gemstar. Gemstar was added as a party
to this case and asserted these patents against us. We have examined these
patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or
services. A Markman ruling interpreting the patent claims was issued by the
Court and in response to that ruling we filed motions for summary judgment of
non-infringement for each of the asserted patents. Gemstar filed a motion for
summary judgment of infringement with respect to one of the patents. During
July 2002, the Court issued a Memorandum of Opinion on the summary judgment
motions. In its Opinion, the Court ruled that none of our products infringe
the 5,038,211 and 5,293,357 patents. With respect to the 4,751,578 patent, the
Court ruled that none of our current products infringed that patent and asked
for additional information before it could rule on certain low-volume products
that are no longer in production. During July 2002, the Court summarily ruled
that the aforementioned low-volume products did not infringe any of the
asserted patents. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case and awarded us our
court costs. Superguide and Gemstar are appealing this case to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We will continue to
vigorously defend this case. In the event the Federal Circuit ultimately
determines that we infringe on any of the aforementioned patents, we may be
subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly
electronic programming guide and related features that we currently offer to
consumers. It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome of
the suits.

California Actions

A purported class action was filed against us in the California State
Superior Court for Alameda County during May 2001 by Andrew A. Werby. The
complaint, relating to late fees, alleges unlawful, unfair and fraudulent
business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code
Section 17200 et seq., false and misleading advertising in violation of
California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, and violation of the
California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. During September 2001, we filed an
answer denying all material allegations of the complaint, and the Court entered
an Order Pursuant to Stipulation for a provisional certification of the class,
for an orderly exchange of information and for mediation. The provisional
Order specifies that the class will be de-certified upon notice if mediation
does not resolve the dispute. A settlement has been reached with plaintiff’s
counsel and the Court issued its preliminary approval of the settlement on
October 18, 2002. The Court has set a March 7, 2003 date for hearing on final
approval after notice to the class. If the settlement is not approved, we
intend to deny all liability and to vigorously defend the lawsuit. The
settlement confirms that the late fee charged by EchoStar is appropriate and
will not change.

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal
clear digital video,” “CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and
with respect to the number of channels available in various programming
packages was also filed against us in the California State Superior Court for
Los Angeles County in 1999 by David



Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit unincorporated
association. The complaint alleges breach of express warranty and violation of
the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code Sections 1750, et seq.,
and the California Business & Professions Code Sections 17500 & 17200. A
hearing on the plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and our Motion for
Summary Judgment was held during June 2002. At the hearing, the Court issued a
preliminary ruling denying the plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.
However, before issuing a final ruling on Class Certification, the Court
granted our Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to all of the plaintiffs’
claims. Subsequently, we filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees which was denied
by the Court. The Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court’s Granting
of our Motion for Summary Judgment and we Cross-Appealed the Court’s ruling on
our Motion for Attorney’s Fees. It is not possible to make a firm assessment
of the probable outcome of the appeal or to determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

State Investigation

During April 2002, two state attorneys general commenced a civil
investigation concerning certain of our business practices. Over the course of
the next six months, 11 additional states ultimately joined the investigation.
The states allege failure to comply with consumer protection laws based on our
call response times and policies, advertising and customer agreement
disclosures, policies for handling consumer complaints, issuing rebates and
refunds and charging cancellation fees to consumers, and other matters. We
have cooperated fully in the investigation and are currently in settlement
discussions with the states. It is not possible to determine the extent of any
damages or injunctive relief which could result in the event a settlement is
not reached.

Retailer Class Actions

We have been sued by retailers in three separate purported class actions.
During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed in the Arapahoe County
District Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District Court
for the District of Colorado, respectively, by Air Communication & Satellite,
Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of themselves and a class of persons
similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify nationwide
classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The
plaintiffs are requesting the Courts to declare certain provisions of, and
changes to, alleged agreements between us and the retailers invalid and
unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and payments, charge
backs, and other compensation. We intend to vigorously defend against the
suits and to assert a variety of counterclaims. The United States District
Court for the District of Colorado stayed the Federal Court action to allow the
parties to pursue a comprehensive adjudication of their dispute in the Arapahoe
County State Court. John DeJong, d/b/a Nexwave, and Joseph Kelley, d/b/a
Keltronics, subsequently intervened in the Arapahoe County Court action as
plaintiffs and proposed class representatives. We have filed a Motion for
Summary Judgment on all counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have
filed a Motion for Additional Time to Conduct Discovery to enable them to
respond to our motion. The Court has not ruled on either of the two motions.
It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation
or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Satellite Dealers Supply, Inc. (“SDS”) filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas during September 2000,
on behalf of itself and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiff
was attempting to certify a nationwide class on behalf of sellers, installers,
and servicers of satellite equipment who contract with EchoStar and who allege
that we: (1) charged back certain fees paid by members of the class to
professional installers in violation of contractual terms; (2) manipulated the
accounts of subscribers to deny payments to class members; and (3)
misrepresented, to class members, who owns certain equipment related to the
provision of satellite television service. During September 2001, the Court
granted our Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction. The plaintiff
moved for reconsideration of the Court’s order dismissing the case. The Court
denied the Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration. The trial court denied our
Motions for Sanctions against SDS. Both parties have now perfected appeals
before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is not possible to make a firm
assessment of the probable outcome of the appeal or to determine the extent of
any potential liability or damages.

PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture

PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture (“PrimeTime 24”) filed suit against us during
September 1998 seeking damages in excess of $10 million and alleging breach of
contract, wrongful termination of contract, interference with contractual
relations, trademark infringement and unfair competition. We denied all of
PrimeTime 24’s allegations and asserted



various counterclaims. We have reached a settlement agreement with
PrimeTime 24 pursuant to which the parties agreed to release all parties from
any liability and dismiss the case with prejudice. The settlement amount was
not material.

StarBand Shareholder Lawsuit

On August 20, 2002, shareholders in StarBand filed an action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery against us and EchoBand Corporation, together with
four of our executives who sat on the Board of Directors of StarBand, for
alleged breach of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith and loyalty, and
also against us and EchoBand Corporation for aiding and abetting such alleged
breaches. Two of the individual defendants, Charles W. Ergen and David K.
Moskowitz, are members of our Board of Directors. The action stems from the
defendants’ involvement as directors, and EchoBand’s position as a shareholder,
in StarBand, a broadband Internet satellite venture that is currently in
bankruptcy. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to ensure
StarBand’s failure in order to guarantee that our then-pending merger with
Hughes would be successful. Plaintiffs seek an accounting of damages for their
$25 million investment in StarBand in addition to costs and disbursements.
Defendants deny the allegations in the complaint and intend to defend the
litigation vigorously. During October 2002, we, along with the other
defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety based on
lack of personal jurisdiction. These motions have been briefed and oral
argument has been set by the Court for March 18, 2003. It is too early to make
an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Merger Related Proceedings

On October 24, 2002, a purported shareholder filed a Shareholder’s
Derivative Action against us and the current members of our Board of Directors
and named us as a nominal defendant. The plaintiff filed the action in the
United States District Court of Clark County, Nevada. The complaint alleges
breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and other unlawful acts relating to
our agreement to (1) pay Hughes Electronics Corporation a $600 million
termination fee in certain circumstances and (2) acquire Hughes’ shareholder
interest in PanAmSat at a premium rate. The agreements to pay the termination
fee and acquire PanAmSat were required in the event that the merger with
DirecTV was not completed by January 21, 2003. No answer is due from the
defendants, and all parties have entered into a stipulation allowing the
defendants to answer only subject to 30-day notice from the plaintiff. We and
the individual defendants intend to deny all liability and to defend this
action vigorously. It is too early to make an assessment of the probable
outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability
or damages.

Satellite Insurance

In September 1998, we filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a total
loss under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The satellite
insurance consists of separate substantially identical policies with different
carriers for varying amounts that, in combination, create a total insured
amount of $219.3 million. The insurance carriers include La Reunion Spatiale;
AXA Reinsurance Company (n/k/a AXA Corporate Solutions Reinsurance Company),
United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc., United States Aircraft Insurance
Group; Assurances Generales De France I.A.R.T. (AGF); Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s, London; Great Lakes Reinsurance (U.K.) PLC; British Aviation Insurance
Group; If Skaadeforsikring (previously Storebrand); Hannover Re (a/k/a
International Hannover); The Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Company, Ltd.;
Marham Space Consortium (a/k/a Marham Consortium Management); Ace Global
Markets (a/k/a Ace London); M.C. Watkins Syndicate; Goshawk Syndicate
Management Ltd.; D.E. Hope Syndicate 10009 (Formerly Busbridge); Amlin
Aviation; K.J. Coles & Others; H.R. Dumas & Others; Hiscox Syndicates, Ltd.;
Cox Syndicate; Hayward Syndicate; D.J. Marshall & Others; TF Hart; Kiln;
Assitalia Le Assicurazioni D’Italia S.P.A. Roma; La Fondiaria Assicurazione
S.P.A., Firenze; Vittoria Assicurazioni S.P.A., Milano; Ras – Riunione
Adriatica Di Sicurta S.P.A., Milano; Societa Cattolica Di Assicurazioni,
Verano; Siat Assicurazione E Riassicurazione S.P.A, Genova; E. Patrick; ZC
Specialty Insurance; Lloyds of London Syndicates 588 NJM, 1209 Meb AND 861 Meb;
Generali France Assurances; Assurance France Aviation; and Ace Bermuda
Insurance Ltd.

The insurance carriers offered us a total of approximately $88 million, or
40% of the total policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance
claim. The insurers assert, among other things, that EchoStar IV was not a
total loss, as that term is defined in the policy, and that we did not abide by
the exact terms of the insurance policies. We strongly disagree and filed
arbitration claims against the insurers for breach of contract, failure to pay
a valid



insurance claim and bad faith denial of a valid claim, among other things.
Due to individual forum selection clauses in certain of the policies, we are
pursuing our arbitration claims against Ace Bermuda Insurance Ltd. in London,
England, and our arbitration claims against all of the other insurance carriers
in New York, New York. The New York arbitration is currently scheduled to
begin in late April 2003, but the Insurers have recently requested that that
hearing date be delayed. The parties to the London arbitration are currently
negotiating the schedule for a hearing, and, while there can be no assurance,
we anticipate that the hearing date in that proceeding will be set for later in
2003. There can be no assurance that we will receive the amount claimed in
either the New York or the London arbitrations or, if we do, that we will
retain title to EchoStar IV with its reduced capacity.

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to those
actions will not materially affect our financial position or results of
operations.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001.

Revenue

. “Total revenue” for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $4.821
billion, an increase of $820 million or 20% compared to “Total revenue” for the
year ended December 31, 2001 of $4.001 billion. The increase in “Total
revenue” was primarily attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber
growth. The increase in “Total revenue” was partially offset by our free and
reduced price programming promotions, discussed below.

DISH Network “Subscription television services” revenue totaled $4.412
billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $824 million or
23% compared to the same period in 2001. DISH Network “Subscription television
services” revenue principally consists of revenue from basic, premium, local,
international and pay-per-view subscription television services. This increase
was attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth. DISH Network
added approximately 1.35 million net new subscribers for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to approximately 1.57 million net new subscribers
during the same period in 2001. We believe the reduction in net new
subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to the same period
in 2001, resulted from a number of factors, including the continued weak U.S.
economy and stronger competition from advanced digital cable and cable modems.
Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base continues to increase, even if
percentage churn remains constant, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers
are required to sustain net subscriber growth. As of December 31, 2002, we had
approximately 8.18 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately
6.83 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately 20%. DISH
Network “Subscription television services” revenue will continue to increase to
the extent we are successful in increasing the number of DISH Network
subscribers and maintaining or increasing revenue per subscriber. While there
can be no assurance, notwithstanding our expectation of a continued slow U.S.
economy, we expect to add at least 1 million net new subscribers during 2003.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately $49.17 during the
year ended December 31, 2002 and approximately $49.32 during the same period in
2001. The decrease in monthly average revenue per subscriber is primarily
attributable to certain promotions, discussed below, under which new
subscribers received free programming for the first three months of their term
of service, and other promotions under which subscribers received discounted
programming for 12 months. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.00 price
increase in February 2002, the increased availability of local channels by
satellite and an increase in subscribers with multiple set up boxes.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules
governing the delivery of superstations and other factors could cause us to
terminate delivery of distant network channels and superstations to a material
portion of our subscriber base, which could cause many of those customers to
cancel their subscription to our other services. Any such terminations could
result in a small reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and could
result in an increase in our percentage churn.

In April 2002, the FCC concluded that our “must carry” implementation
methods were not in compliance with the “must carry” rules. If the FCC finds
our subsequent remedial actions unsatisfactory, we could be forced by capacity
constraints to reduce the number of markets in which we provide local channels.
This could cause a temporary increase in churn.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, “DTH equipment sales” totaled $288
million, an increase of $17 million compared to the same period during 2001.
“DTH equipment sales” consist of sales and maintenance of digital set-top boxes
and other digital satellite broadcasting equipment by our ETC subsidiary to
Bell ExpressVu, a subsidiary of Bell Canada, Canada’s national telephone
company, and sales of DBS accessories in the United States. The increase in
“DTH equipment sales” principally resulted from an increase in sales of DBS
accessories to DISH Network subscribers. This increase was partially offset by
a decrease in sales of digital set-top boxes to our international DTH
customers.



Through 2002, our primary international customer was Bell ExpressVu. We
currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu, and we are
actively trying to secure new orders from other potential international
customers. However, we cannot guarantee at this time that those negotiations
will be successful. Our future international revenue depends largely on the
success of these and other international operators, which in turn, depends on
other factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of direct-to-home
satellite TV products and the increasing intensity of competition for
international subscription television subscribers.

DISH Network Operating Expenses.

“DISH Network operating expenses”
totaled $2.218 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of
$460 million or 26% compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “DISH
Network operating expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the
number of DISH Network subscribers. “DISH Network operating expenses”
represented 50% and 49% of “Subscription television services” revenue during
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in
“DISH Network operating expenses” as a percentage of “Subscription television
services” revenue primarily resulted from the expansion of our DISH Network
Service Corporation, the opening of a new call center, increased costs in order
to meet the demands of current “must carry” requirements and costs associated
with offering additional markets where we carry local channels.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $1.766 billion during the year ended
December, 2002, an increase of $333 million compared to the same period in
2001. The increase in total “Subscriber-related expenses” is primarily
attributable to the increase in DISH Network subscribers. Such expenses, which
include programming expenses, copyright royalties, residuals currently payable
to retailers and distributors, and billing, lockbox and other variable
subscriber expenses, represented 40% of “Subscription television services”
revenues during each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001. Promotions under which subscribers received free or discounted
programming increased “subscriber-related expenses” as a percentage
of “subscription television services” revenue in 2002 as compared to
2001. This increase was offset by a variety of factors including
$1.00 price increase in February 2002, the increased availability of
local channels by satellite in 2002 and an increase in subscribers
with multiple set-top boxes.

“Customer service center and other” expenses principally consist of costs
incurred in the operation of our DISH Network customer service centers, such as
personnel and telephone expenses, as well as other operating expenses related
to our DISH Network Service Corporation business. “Customer service center and
other” expenses totaled $390 million during the year ended December 31, 2002,
an increase of $105 million as compared to the same period in 2001. “Customer
service center and other” expenses totaled 9% and 8% of “Subscription
television services” revenue during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The increase in “Customer service center and other” expenses in
total and as a percentage of “Subscription television services” revenue
primarily resulted from increased personnel and telephone expenses to support
the growth of the DISH Network, the opening of a new call center, increased
operating expenses related to the expansion of our DISH Network Service
Corporation business, increased competition and increased costs due to
second-dish installations in order to meet the demands of “must carry”. These
expenses and percentages could temporarily increase in the future as additional
infrastructure is added to meet future growth. We intend to continue to
implement the automation of simple telephone responses and to increase Internet
and satellite receiver-based customer assistance in the future in order to
better manage customer service costs.

“Satellite and transmission” expenses include expenses associated with the
operation of our digital broadcast centers and contracted satellite telemetry,
tracking and control services. “Satellite and transmission” expenses totaled
$61 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a $21 million increase
compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “Satellite and
transmission” expenses primarily resulted from increased operations at our
digital broadcast centers in order to meet the demands of current “must carry”
requirements and the launch of 18 additional local markets during the year
ended December 31, 2002. “Satellite and transmission” expenses totaled 1% of
“Subscription television services” revenue during each of the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001. “Satellite and transmission” expenses could
increase in the future as additional satellites are placed in service,
additional local markets are launched, to the extent we successfully obtain
commercial in-orbit insurance and to the extent we increase the operations at
our digital broadcast centers in order, among other reasons, to meet the
demands of current “must carry” requirements.

Cost of sales – DTH equipment.

“Cost of sales – DTH equipment” totaled
$179 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $9 million
compared to the same period in 2001. “Cost of sales – DTH equipment”
principally includes costs associated with digital set-top boxes and related
components sold to international DTH operators and DBS accessories. “Cost of
sales — DTH equipment” represented 62% and 69% of “DTH equipment sales”, during
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease, both
in aggregate and as a



percentage of revenue, related primarily to reductions in the cost of
set-top box equipment and increased sales of higher margin DBS accessories.

Subscriber Promotions.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, our
marketing promotions included our I Like 9, Free Dish, 1-2-3 Great TV, free
installation program, Free for All and Digital Home Plan, which are described
below.

I Like 9

– During August 2001, we commenced our I Like 9 promotion. Under
this promotion, subscribers who purchased an EchoStar receiver system for $199
or higher, received free installation and either our America’s Top 100 CD or
our DISH Latino Dos programming package for $9 a month for the first year.
Subscriber acquisition costs are materially lower under this plan compared to
historical promotions. This promotion expired January 31, 2002.

Free Dish –

Our Free Dish promotion, under which subscribers receive a
free base-level EchoStar receiver system, commenced during August 2001. To be
eligible, subscribers must provide a valid major credit card and make a
one-year commitment to subscribe to a qualified programming package. Effective
July 13, 2002, eligible subscribers are able to purchase a second receiver for
$49.99. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the
Free Dish promotion, we expect it to continue through at least July 31, 2003.

1-2-3 Great TV –

During January 2002, we commenced our 1-2-3 Great TV
promotion. Under this promotion, subscribers who purchased one or more
receivers, provided a valid major credit card and made a one-year commitment,
received the first three months of qualified programming and installation of up
to two receivers for free. This promotion expired on July 31, 2002.

Free for All –

Effective August 1, 2002, we commenced our Free for All
promotion. Under this promotion, subscribers who purchase up to two receivers
for $149 or more, depending on the models chosen, and subscribe to a qualifying
programming package, receive free installation, together with credits of $12.50
or $17.00 applied to their programming bill each month for a year. Although
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Free For All
promotion, we expect it to continue through at least July 31, 2003.

Digital Home Plan –

Our Digital Home Plan promotion offers several choices
to consumers, ranging from the use of one EchoStar receiver system and our
America’s Top 50 CD programming package for $29.99 per month, to providing
consumers our America’s Top 150 programming package and two or more EchoStar
receiver systems for $52.99 to $62.99 per month. Each plan includes in-home
service, and the consumer must agree to a one-year commitment, provide a valid
major credit card, have an acceptable credit score and incur a one-time set-up
fee of $49.99. From January to July 2002, the promotion also included the
first three months of qualified programming free for qualified Digital Home
Plan programming packages and for an additional $99, consumers could also
choose to include a Dish PVR in the Digital Home Plan. Effective August 1,
2002, the one-time set-up fee includes only the first month’s qualified
programming payment and for an additional $50, consumers can also choose to
include a Dish PVR in the Digital Home Plan. Dish PVR receivers include a
built-in hard drive that allows viewers to pause and record live programming
without the need for videotape. Since we retain ownership of equipment
installed pursuant to the Digital Home Plan promotion, equipment costs are
capitalized and depreciated over a period of approximately four years.
Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Digital
Home Plan promotion, we expect it to continue through at least July 31, 2003.

Free Installation –

Under our free installation program all subscribers
who purchase an EchoStar receiver system are eligible to receive free
professional installation of up to two receivers. Although there can be no
assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Free Installation promotion, we
expect it to continue through at least July 31, 2003.

Subscriber Acquisition Costs.

Generally, under most promotions, we
subsidize the installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar
receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. There is no
clear industry standard used in the calculation of subscriber acquisition
costs. Our subscriber acquisition costs include “Cost of sales – subscriber
promotion subsidies”, “Other subscriber promotion subsidies” and DISH Network
acquisition marketing expenses. “Cost of sales – subscriber promotion
subsidies” includes the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and
other distributors of our equipment and receiver systems sold directly by
EchoStar to subscribers. “Other subscriber promotion subsidies” includes net
costs related to our free installation promotion and other promotional
incentives.



During the year ended December 31, 2002, our subscriber acquisition costs
totaled approximately $1.163 billion, or approximately $421 per new subscriber
activation. Comparatively, our subscriber acquisition costs during the year
ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $1.074 billion, or approximately
$395 per new subscriber activation. Total subscriber acquisition costs for the
year ended December 31, 2002 include favorable adjustments which reduced the
costs related to the production of EchoStar receiver systems. During 2002, we
recorded adjustments of approximately $48 million as a result of favorable
litigation developments and the completion of royalty arrangements with more
favorable terms than estimated amounts previously accrued. The increase in
total subscriber acquisition costs primarily resulted from an increase in
“Other subscriber promotion subsidies” related to additional subsidies on
second receiver installations and a decrease in the sales price of manufactured
equipment, as well as an increase in “Advertising and other” expense related to
acquisition marketing and our 2002 marketing promotions. A decrease in
Digital Home Plan penetration in 2002 as compared to 2001 also
contributed to this increase. This increase was partially
offset by reductions in the cost of manufactured equipment and an increase in
installations we perform on behalf of retailers. Our subscriber acquisition
costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may
materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce other more
aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to
competition, or for other reasons.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion
from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude
payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital Home Plan
subscribers from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. Equipment
capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion totaled approximately $278
million and $338 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Payments and returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital
Home Plan subscribers, which became available for sale through other promotions
rather than being redeployed in the Digital Home Plan, totaled approximately
$38 million and $16 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

General and Administrative Expenses.

“General and administrative”
expenses totaled $387 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, an
increase of $9 million compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in
“G&A” expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and
infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses and litigation
settlements. “G&A” expenses represented 8% and 9% of “Total revenue” during
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Non-cash, Stock-based Compensation.

During 1999, we adopted an incentive
plan under our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, which provided certain key employees
with incentives including stock options. The payment of these incentives was
contingent upon our achievement of certain financial and other goals. We met
certain of these goals during 1999. Accordingly, during 1999 we recorded
approximately $179 million of deferred compensation related to post-grant
appreciation of stock options granted pursuant to the 1999 incentive plan. The
related deferred compensation, net of forfeitures, will be recognized over the
five-year vesting period. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2002
we recognized $11 million of compensation under this performance-based plan, a
decrease of $9 million compared to the same period in 2001. This decrease is
primarily attributable to proportionate vesting and stock option forfeitures.
The remaining deferred compensation of $9 million, which will be reduced by
future forfeitures, if any, will be recognized over the remaining vesting
period.

We report all non-cash compensation based on stock option appreciation as
a single expense category in our accompanying statements of operations. The
following table represents the other expense categories in our statements of
operations that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based compensation was
allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation for key
employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan (in thousands):

Options to purchase an additional 9.1 million shares are outstanding as of
December 31, 2002 and were granted with exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying shares on the date they were issued during 1999, 2000
and 2001 pursuant to a long term incentive plan under our 1995 Stock Incentive
Plan. The weighted-average exercise price of these options is $8.96. Vesting
of these options is contingent upon meeting certain longer-term goals which
have not yet been achieved. Consequently, no compensation was recorded during
the year ended December 31, 2002 related to these long-term options. EchoStar
will record the related compensation at the achievement of the performance
goals. Such compensation, if recorded, would likely result in material
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in our statements of operations.

Pre-Marketing Cash Flow.

Pre-marketing cash flow is comprised of EBITDA,
as defined below, plus “Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies,” “Other
subscriber promotion subsidies” and “Advertising and other” expenses.
Pre-marketing cash flow was $1.982 billion during the year ended December 31,
2002, an increase of $386 million or 24% compared to the same period in 2001.
Our pre-marketing cash flow as a percentage of “Total revenue” was
approximately 41% and 40% during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

. EBITDA is
defined as “Operating income (loss)” plus “Depreciation and amortization,” and
is adjusted for “Non-cash, stock-based compensation.” EBITDA was $806 million
during the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $511 million during the
same period in 2001. The improvement in EBITDA was directly attributable to
the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which continues to
result in revenue sufficient to support the cost of new and existing
subscribers, and to previously discussed adjustments totaling approximately $53
million which reduce the costs related to the production of receiver systems.
The improvement was partially offset by a decrease in Digital Home Plan
penetration compared to the same period in 2001, resulting in a reduction in
capitalized costs for the period. Our calculation of EBITDA for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 does not include approximately $11 million and
$20 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense resulting from
post-grant appreciation of employee stock options. In addition, EBITDA does
not include the impact of capital expenditures under our Digital Home Plan
promotion of approximately $278 million and $338 million during 2002 and 2001,
respectively. As previously discussed, to the extent we introduce more
aggressive marketing promotions and our subscriber acquisition costs materially
increase, our EBITDA results will be negatively impacted because subscriber
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred.

accompanying financial statements:

It is important to note that EBITDA and pre-marketing cash flow are
supplemental non-GAAP measures and do not represent cash provided or used by
operating activities. Through 2002, we used EBITDA and pre-marketing cash flow
as two of the measurements of operating efficiency and overall financial
performance and believed these can be helpful measures for those evaluating
companies in the multi-channel video programming distribution industry.
Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that
could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures because
EBITDA is independent of the actual leverage and capital expenditures employed
by the business. Pre-marketing cash flow measures EBITDA before costs incurred
to acquire subscribers to help assess the amount of income generated each
period to be used to service debt and acquire subscribers. EBITDA and
pre-marketing cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.



Depreciation and Amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense
totaled $373 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a $94 million
increase compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “Depreciation
and amortization” expense principally resulted from an increase in depreciation
related to the commencement of commercial operation of EchoStar VII in April
2002, commencement of commercial operations of EchoStar VIII in October 2002
and Digital Home Plan equipment and other additional depreciable assets placed
in service. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately
$19 million of amortization expense as a result of our adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“FAS 142”). In accordance with FAS
142, effective January 2002 we ceased amortization of our FCC authorizations.

Other Income and Expense.

“Other expense,” net, totaled $1.230 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $804 million compared
to the same period in 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to costs expensed upon termination of the merger of approximately $690 million, which consist of a $600 million termination fee paid to Hughes,
$57 million of previously capitalized merger costs and $33 million of fees paid in connection with merger financing activities. The
increase also resulted from an increase in “Other” related to net losses on
marketable and non-marketable investment securities of approximately $136
million recorded in 2002 compared to approximately $110 million recorded in
2001 and net charges of approximately $20 million relating to the Vivendi
contingent value rights which were outstanding during a portion of 2002. The
contingent value rights are described more fully in Note 1 to the accompanying
financial statements.



The increase in “Other expense” was partially offset by a
decrease in equity losses of affiliates. “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” increased as a result of the
issuance of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes in December 2001, the issuance of our 5 3/4%
Convertible Subordinated Notes in May 2001 and interest costs related to our merger
financing activities. Interest income increased as a result of higher cash balances in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Net loss.

“Net loss” was $882 million during the year ended December 31,
2002, an increase of $667 million compared to “Net loss” of $215 million for
the same period in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an
increase in “Other income (expense)” discussed above. The increase in net loss
was partially offset by an improvement in “Operating income (loss)” as
discussed above.

Net loss attributable to common shareholders.

“Net loss attributable to
common shareholders” was $444 million during the year ended December 31, 2002,
an increase of $228 million compared to “Net loss attributable to common
shareholders” of $216 million for the same period in 2001. The increase is
primarily attributable to the increase in “Net loss”, discussed above. The
increase was partially offset by a $437 million gain on the redemption of
Series D convertible preferred stock from Vivendi. The redemption is described
more fully in Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements.

Net cash flows from operating activities and purchases of property and
equipment.

“Net cash flows from operating activities,” as reported in our
consolidated statements of cash flows, includes net income or loss for the
period, adjusted for certain non-cash items including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization, realized and unrealized gains and losses on
investments, deferred tax expense, and non-cash, stock-based compensation.
“Net cash flows from operating activities” also includes changes in assets and
liabilities during the period. “Net cash flows from operating activities” does
not include investing activities or financing activities, nor does it include
charges relating to losses on investing or financing activities. “Net cash
flows from operating activities” was $67 million and $489 million during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in “Net
cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to the $600
million merger termination fee paid to Hughes. Our consolidated statements of
cash flows detail the significant components of “net cash flows from operating
activities.”

“Purchases of property and equipment” were $436 million and $637 million
during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This decrease
was primarily attributable to reduced spending on the construction of
satellites and the capitalization of less equipment under our Digital Home Plan
in 2002 as compared to 2001.

“Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and
equipment” was negative $369 million and negative $148 million for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease from 2001 was
primarily attributable to a Hughes merger termination fee noted above.
Exclusive of the $600 million merger termination fee, “net cash flows from
operating activities” less “purchases of property and equipment” would have
been $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. While there can be no
assurance, assuming the addition of 1 million net new subscribers, we currently
expect “net cash flows from operating activities” less “purchases of property
and equipment” to be greater than $231 million during 2003. Our estimate could
vary significantly depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth,
subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, operating efficiencies, the timing of
payments and receipts, inventory levels, increases or decreases in capital
expenditures and other factors. Our estimate includes capital expenditures of
approximately $300 million for satellite construction, local market expansion,
upgrades to our information technology infrastructure and other general
corporate purposes. Our capital expenditure estimate could increase or
decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or
other factors. In addition to these capital expenditures, we will have capital
expenditures for equipment under our Digital Home Plan promotion. The amount
of equipment capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion in 2003 will
depend upon the level of Digital Home Plan penetration during 2003. The cost
of equipment capitalized under the Digital Home Plan is included in “purchases
of property and equipment.” Net equipment costs for all other promotions is
generally expensed as incurred and included in “net cash flows from operating
activities.”

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000.

Revenue

. “Total revenue” for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $4.001
billion, an increase of $1.286 billion or 47% compared to total revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2000 of $2.715 billion. The increase in “total
revenue” was primarily attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth
and higher average revenue per subscriber.

DISH Network “Subscription television services” revenue totaled $3.588
billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.241 billion or
53% compared to the same period in 2000. This increase was directly
attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and higher average
revenue per subscriber. DISH Network added approximately 1.57 million net new
subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to approximately 1.85
million net new subscriber additions during the same period in 2000. As of
December 31, 2001, we had approximately 6.83 million DISH Network subscribers
compared to approximately 5.26 million at December 31, 2000, an increase of
approximately 30%. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately
$49.32 during the year ended December 31, 2001 and approximately $45.33 during
the same period in 2000. The increase in monthly average revenue per
subscriber is primarily due to the $1.00 price increase in May 2000 and
February 2001, the increased availability of local channels by satellite, the
introduction of our high-end America’s Top 150 basic programming package during
April 2000, together with an increase in subscriber penetration in our higher
priced Digital Home Plans.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, “DTH equipment sales” totaled $271
million, an increase of $11 million compared to the same period during 2000.
This increase in “DTH equipment sales” was primarily attributable to an
increase in sales of StarBand equipment and DBS accessories. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease in demand for digital set-top boxes from our two
primary international DTH customers.

DISH Network Operating Expenses.

“DISH Network operating expenses”
totaled $1.758 billion during the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$493 million or 39% compared to the same period in 2000. “DISH Network
operating expenses” represented 49% and 54% of “Subscription television
services” revenue during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in “DISH Network operating expenses” in total was
consistent with, and primarily attributable to, the increase in the number of
DISH Network subscribers.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $1.433 billion during the year ended
December 31, 2001, an increase of $463 million compared to the same period in
2000. The increase in total “Subscriber-related expenses” is primarily
attributable to the increase in DISH Network subscribers. Such expenses
represented 40% and 41% of “subscription television services” revenues during
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

“Customer service center and other” expenses totaled $285 million during
the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $34 million as compared to the
same period in 2000. The increase in “customer service center and other”
expenses primarily resulted from increased personnel and telephone expenses to
support the growth of the DISH



Network and from operating expenses related to
the expansion of our installation and service business. “Customer
service center and other” expenses totaled 8% of “subscription television
services” revenue during the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to 11%
during the same period in 2000. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio
primarily resulted from the reduction of on-going construction and start-up
costs of our fifth customer service center in Virginia and our sixth customer
service center in West Virginia which occurred during 2000, as well as
increased operating efficiencies during 2001.

“Satellite and transmission” expenses totaled $40 million during the year
ended December 31, 2001, a $4 million decrease compared to the same period in
2000. “Satellite and transmission” expenses totaled 1% and 2% of “subscription
television services” revenue during the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively

Cost of sales – DTH equipment.

“Cost of sales — DTH equipment” totaled
$188 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $7 million
compared to the same period in 2000. The decrease in “cost of sales — DTH
equipment” principally resulted from a decrease in sales of digital set-top
boxes to our two primary international DTH customers. “Cost of sales — DTH
equipment” represented 69% and 75% of “DTH equipment sales” revenue, during the
year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in this
expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from an increase in sales of
higher-margin DBS accessories during 2001.

Subscriber Acquisition Costs.

Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.074
billion during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1.155 billion for
the same period in 2000. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in
“Other subscriber promotion subsidies” as a result of higher penetration of our
Digital Home Plan promotion, pursuant to which certain equipment costs are
capitalized, as discussed below. This decrease was partially offset by an
increase in “Other subscriber promotion subsidies” due to increases in
installation subsidies for multiple receivers under the Digital Home Plan
promotion and an increase in advertising expense related to our 2001 marketing
promotions, primarily our I Like 9 promotion. “Other subscriber promotion
subsidies” includes the cost related to EchoStar receiver systems distributed
to retailers and other distributors of our equipment and net costs related to
our free installation promotion and other promotional incentives. “Advertising
and other” expenses totaled $147 million and $139 million during the year ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion
from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital Home Plan
subscribers from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. Equipment
capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion totaled approximately $338
million and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Payments and returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital
Home Plan subscribers, which became available for sale through other promotions
rather than being redeployed in Digital Home Plan, totaled approximately $16
million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Cash and returned equipment
were insignificant during 2000.

General and Administrative Expenses.

“General and administrative”
expenses totaled $378 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, an
increase of $128 million as compared to the same period in 2000. The increase
in “G&A” expenses was principally attributable to increased legal fees and
personnel expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. “G&A” expenses
represented 9% of “total revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000.

Non-cash, Stock-based Compensation.

As a result of substantial post-grant
appreciation of stock options, during the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000 we recognized $20 million and $51 million, respectively, of compensation
under the 1999 incentive plan. The remaining deferred compensation expense ,
which will be reduced by future forfeitures, if any, will be recognized over
the remaining vesting period.

We report all non-cash compensation based on stock option appreciation as
a single expense category in our accompanying statements of operations. The
following table represents the other expense categories in our statements of
operations that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based compensation was
allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation for key
employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan:

Pre-Marketing Cash Flow.

Pre-marketing cash flow is comprised of EBITDA,
as defined below, plus “cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies,” “other
subscriber subsidies” and “advertising and other” expenses. Pre-marketing cash
flow was $1.596 billion during the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
64% compared to the same period in 2000. Our pre-marketing cash flow as a
percentage of total revenue was approximately 40% during the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to 36% during the same period in 2000.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

. EBITDA is
defined as “operating income (loss)” plus “depreciation and amortization,” and
“non-cash, stock-based compensation.” EBITDA was $511 million during the year
ended December 31, 2001, compared to negative $187 million during the same
period in 2000. This improvement in EBITDA was directly attributable to the
increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers and higher average revenue
per subscriber, resulting in recurring revenue which was large enough to
support the cost of new and existing subscribers, together with the
introduction of our Digital Home Plan in July 2000. Our calculation of EBITDA
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 does not include approximately
$20 million and $51 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense
resulting from post-grant appreciation of employee stock options. In addition,
EBITDA does not include the impact of amounts capitalized under our Digital
Home Plan of approximately $338 million and $65 million during 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The following table reflects the reconciliation of pre-marketing cash flow

Depreciation and Amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expenses
aggregated $279 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, a $94 million
increase compared to the same period in 2000. The increase in depreciation and
amortization expenses principally resulted from an increase in depreciation
related to the commencement of operation of EchoStar VI in October 2000 and
other depreciable assets, including Digital Home Plan equipment, placed in
service during late 2000 and 2001.

Other Income and Expense.

“Other expense,” net, totaled $426 million
during the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $200 million compared
to the same period in 2000. This increase primarily resulted from an increase
in interest expense as a result of the issuance of our 10 3/8% Senior Notes in
September 2000 and the issuance of our 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes in
May 2001 and from net losses on marketable and non-marketable investment
securities of approximately $110 million. This increase in interest expense
was partially offset by an increase in interest income and capitalized interest
during 2001.

Net loss.

“Net loss” was $215 million during the year ended December 31,
2001, an improvement of $435 million compared to “Net loss” of $650 million for
the same period in 2000. This improvement is primarily attributable to
increases in “Subscription television services” revenue discussed above.

Net loss attributable to common shareholders.

“Net loss attributable to
common shareholders” was $216 million during the year ended December 31, 2001,
an improvement of $435 million compared to “Net loss available to common
shareholders” of $651 million for the same period in 2000. This improvement is
primarily attributable to the improvement in “Net loss”, as discussed above.

Net cash flows from operating activities and purchases of property and
equipment.

“Net cash flows from operating activities,” as reported in our
consolidated statements of cash flows, includes net income or loss for the
period, adjusted for certain non-cash items including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization, realized and unrealized gains and losses on
investments, deferred tax expense, and non-cash, stock-based compensation. “Net
cash flows from operating activities” also includes changes in assets and
liabilities during the period. “Net cash flows from operating activities” does
not include investing activities or financing activities, nor does it include
charges relating to losses on investing or financing activities. “Net cash flows
from operating activities” was $489 million and negative $119 million during the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement in “net
cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to the
improvement in net loss. Our consolidated statements of cash flows detail the
significant components of “net cash flows from operating activities.”

“Purchases of property and equipment” were $637 million and $331
million during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This
increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on the construction of
satellites and an increase of equipment capitalized under our Digital Home Plan
in 2001 as compared to 2000.

“Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property
and equipment” was negative $148 million and negative $450 million for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Sources

As of December 31, 2002, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash
equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $2.848 billion,
including $151 million of cash reserved for satellite insurance and
approximately $10 million of other restricted cash, compared to $2.952 billion,
including $122 million of cash reserved for satellite insurance and $1 million
of other restricted cash, as of December 31, 2001. For the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, we reported net cash flows from operating
activities of $67 million and $489 million, respectively. Net cash
flows from operating activities during 2002 includes approximately $600 million
of expenses related to termination of the merger with Hughes.

We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt
service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and
investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to
generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among
other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There
can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any or all of our
goals. The amount of capital required to fund our 2003 working capital and
capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate
at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition,
including capitalized costs associated with our Digital Home Plan. Our capital
expenditures will also vary depending on the number of satellites under
construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure
requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition
for subscription television customers, significant



satellite failures, or in the event of continued general economic
downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise
additional capital in the future.

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or
acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance
our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. As a
result, acquisition discussions and offers, and in some cases, negotiations may
take place and future material investments or acquisitions involving cash, debt
or equity securities or a combination thereof may result.

Investment Securities

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as
available-for-sale. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, we adjust the carrying value of our available-for-sale marketable
investment securities to fair market value and report the related temporary
unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit,
net of related deferred income tax, if applicable. Declines in the fair market
value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other than
temporary” must be recognized in the statement of operations, thus establishing
a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment
securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the
market value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly
evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our
marketable investment securities compared to the carrying value of these
securities, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any
market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally,
absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of
investments below cost basis for a period of less than six months are
considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a
period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine
whether any company or market-specific factors exist which would indicate that
such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of
investments below cost basis for greater than nine months are considered other
than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors
to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2002, we recorded unrealized gains of approximately $6
million as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit. During the year
ended December 31, 2002, we also recorded an aggregate charge to earnings for
other than temporary declines in the fair market value of certain of our
marketable investment securities of approximately $117 million and established
a new cost basis for these securities. This amount does not include realized
gains of approximately $12 million on the sales of marketable investment
securities. Our approximately $2.8 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash,
cash equivalents and marketable investment securities include debt and equity
securities which we own for strategic and financial purposes. The fair market
value of these strategic marketable investment securities aggregated
approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2002. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, our portfolio generally, and our strategic investments
particularly, experienced volatility. If the fair market value of our
marketable securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we
become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the
carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to
record additional charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of
the decline in fair value.

We also have made strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable
investment securities. The securities of these companies are not publicly
traded. Our ability to create realizable value from our strategic investments
in companies that are not public is dependent on the success of their business
and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans.
Since private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also
increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when
we desire to sell them that we will not be able to obtain full value for them.
We evaluate our non-marketable investment securities on a quarterly basis to
determine whether the carrying value of each investment is impaired. This
quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company
business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors
which may indicate an impairment in our investment. Such factors may include,
but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of
debt covenants and changes in business strategy.

We made a strategic investment in StarBand Communications, Inc. During
the first quarter of 2002, we determined that the carrying value of our
investment in StarBand, net of approximately $8 million of equity in losses of
StarBand already recorded during 2002, was not recoverable and recorded an
impairment charge of approximately $28 million to reduce the carrying value of
our StarBand investment to zero. This determination was based, among other
things, on our continuing evaluation of StarBand’s business model, including
further deterioration of StarBand’s limited available cash, combined with
increasing cash requirements, resulting in a critical need for additional
funding,



with no clear path to obtain that cash. Further, during April 2002, we
changed our sales and marketing relationship with StarBand and ceased
subsidizing StarBand equipment. StarBand subsequently filed for bankruptcy
during June 2002.

Subscriber Turnover

Our percentage monthly churn for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
approximately 1.59%, compared to our percentage churn for the same period in
2001 of approximately 1.60%. We calculate percentage monthly churn by dividing
the number of subscribers who terminate service during the month by total
subscribers as of the beginning of the month. We are not aware of any uniform
standards for calculating churn and believe presentations of churn may not be
calculated consistently by different entities in the same or similar
businesses. Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC
rules governing the delivery of superstations and other factors could cause us
to terminate delivery of distant network channels and superstations to a
material portion of our subscriber base, which could cause many of those
customers to cancel their subscription to our other services. Any such
terminations could result in a small reduction in average monthly revenue per
subscriber and could result in an increase in our percentage churn. In
addition, price increases, which were effective February 1, 2003, could cause a
temporary increase in churn. Increases in piracy or theft of our signal, or
our competitors’ signals, could cause churn to increase in future periods. In
April 2002, the FCC concluded that our “must carry” implementation methods were
not in compliance with the “must carry” rules. If the FCC finds our subsequent
remedial actions unsatisfactory, we could be forced by capacity constraints to
reduce the number of markets in which we provide local channels. This could
cause a temporary increase in churn.

Subscriber Acquisition Costs

As previously described, we generally subsidize the cost and installation
of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers.
Our average subscriber acquisition costs were approximately $421 per new
subscriber activation during the year ended December 31, 2002. While there can
be no assurance, we believe heightened credit procedures we implemented during
the first quarter of 2002, together with promotions tailored towards
subscribers with multiple receivers, will attract better long-term subscribers.
Our subscriber acquisition costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new
subscriber activation basis, may materially increase to the extent that we
introduce other more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are
necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion
from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude
payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital Home Plan
subscribers from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. Equipment
capitalized under our Digital Home Plan promotion totaled approximately $278
million and $338 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Payments and returned equipment received from disconnecting Digital
Home Plan subscribers, which became available for sale through other promotions
rather than being redeployed in the Digital Home Plan, totaled approximately
$38 million and $16 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Funds necessary to meet subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be
satisfied from existing cash and investment balances to the extent available.
We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these
requirements. If we decide to raise capital today, a variety of debt and
equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be
no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms,
or at all, if needed in the future.

Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now have and may in the
future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or
affect products or services directly or indirectly related to those that we
offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products
infringes on intellectual property held by others, we would be required to
cease developing or marketing those products, to obtain licenses to develop and
market those products from the holders of the intellectual property, or to
redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims.
Material damage awards, including the potential for triple damages under
patent laws, could also result. Various parties have asserted patent and other
intellectual property rights with respect to



components within our direct broadcast satellite system. Certain of these
parties have filed suit against us, including Gemstar, Starsight and
Superguide, as previously described. We cannot be certain that these persons
do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on these
rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on
commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses,
that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

Certain Gemstar patents are currently being reviewed by the International
Trade Commission. An adverse decision could temporarily halt the import of our
receivers and could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly
electronic programming guides and related features we currently offer to
consumers.

The indentures related to certain of EDBS’ senior notes contain
restrictive covenants that require us to maintain satellite insurance with
respect to at least half of the satellites we own or lease. All of our eight
in-orbit DBS satellites are currently owned by direct or indirect subsidiaries
of EDBS. Insurance coverage is therefore required for at least four of our
eight satellites. The launch and/or in-orbit insurance policies for EchoStar I
through EchoStar VIII have expired. We have been unable to obtain insurance on
any of these satellites on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we are
currently self-insuring these satellites. To satisfy insurance covenants
related to EDBS’ senior notes, we have reclassified an amount equal to the
depreciated cost of four of its satellites from cash and cash equivalents to
cash reserved for satellite insurance on our balance sheet. As of December 31,
2002, cash reserved for satellite insurance totaled approximately $151 million.
The reclassifications will continue until such time, if ever, as we can again
insure our satellites on acceptable terms and for acceptable amounts, or until
the covenants requiring the insurance are no longer applicable. We believe we
have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously recover
transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites
fails. However, the cash reserved for satellite insurance is not adequate to
fund the construction, launch and insurance for a replacement satellite in the
event of a complete loss of a satellite. Programming continuity cannot be
assured in the event of multiple satellite losses.

As of December 31, 2002, the following amounts were outstanding under
vendor financings for our satellites: Approximately $11 million for EchoStar
IV, which bears interest at 8 1/4% and is payable over five years



from launch; approximately $15 million for EchoStar VII, which bears
interest at 8% and is payable over 13 years from launch; and approximately $15
million for EchoStar VIII, which also bears interest at 8 % but is payable over
14 years from launch.

The repayment obligations of EDBS under the vendor financings for EchoStar
IV and Echostar Orbital Corporation under the vendor financing for EchoStar VII
are guaranteed by EchoStar. The maximum potential future payments under these
guarantees are equal to the respective amounts of outstanding principal and
accrued interest.

In addition to our DBS business plan, we have a business plan for a
two-satellite FSS Ku-band satellite system and a two-satellite FSS Ka-band
satellite system. We are currently funding the construction phase for one of
these satellites, EchoStar IX, a hybrid C/Ku/Ka-band satellite.

We currently own a 90% interest in VisionStar, Inc., (“VisionStar”) which
holds a Ka-band FCC license at the 113 degree orbital location. We did not
complete construction or launch of the satellite by the milestone deadlines and
have requested an extension of these milestones from the FCC. Failure to
receive an extension, of which there can be no assurance, would render the
license invalid. In the future, we may fund construction, launch and insurance
of this and additional satellites through cash from operations, public or
private debt or equity financing, joint ventures with others, or from other
sources, although there is no assurance that such funding will be available.

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or
acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance
our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. As a
result, acquisition discussions and offers, and in some cases, negotiations may
take place and future material investments or acquisitions involving cash, debt
or equity securities or a combination thereof may result.

We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt
service requirements will be satisfied from existing cash and investment
balances, and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive
future operating and net cash flows is dependent, among other things, upon our
ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers, our ability to manage the
growth of our subscriber base, and our ability to grow our ETC business. To
the extent future subscriber growth exceeds our expectations, it may be
necessary for us to raise additional capital to fund increased working capital
requirements. There may be a number of other factors, some of which are beyond
our control or ability to predict, that could require us to raise additional
capital. These factors include unexpected increases in operating costs and
expenses, a defect in or the loss of any satellite, or an increase in the cost
of acquiring subscribers due to additional competition, among other things. If
cash generated from our operations is not sufficient to meet our debt service
requirements or other obligations, we would be required to obtain cash from
other financing sources. However, there can be no assurance that such financing
would be available on terms acceptable to us, or if available, that the
proceeds of such financing would be sufficient to enable us to meet all of our
obligations.

Security Ratings

Our current credit ratings are B1 and B+ on our long-term senior notes,
and Caa1 and B

-

with respect to our convertible subordinated notes, as rated by
Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s Rating Services,
respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each
agency’s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they
come due. With respect to Moody’s, the B1 rating for senior debt indicates that
the assurance of interest and principal payment and principal security over any
long period of time is small. For S&P, the B+ and B- rating indicates the
issuer is vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations, but
the issuer has the capacity to meet its financial commitments on the
obligations. With respect to Moody’s, the Caa1 rating for the convertible
subordinated debt indicates that the security presents elements of significant
risk with respect to principal or interest. In general, lower ratings result
in higher borrowing costs. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any
time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating.



Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business
operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting
policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Note that our preparation of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. There can
be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”), which will require companies to
record exit, including restructuring, or disposal costs when they are incurred
and can be measured at fair value, and subsequently adjust the recorded
liability for changes in estimated cash flows. FAS 146 also provides specific
guidance on accounting for employee and contract terminations that are part of
restructuring activities. The new requirements in FAS 146 are effective
prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002. The application of FAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” (“FAS 148”), which (i)
amends FAS Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to
provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily
changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation (ii) amends the disclosure provisions of FAS 123 to require
prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s
accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation
and (iii) amends APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require
disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. Items (ii)
and (iii) of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. EchoStar has
included the requirements of item (ii) in Note 2 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
and will include the requirements of item (iii) beginning in its first interim
period after December 15, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirement for Guarantors, including Indirect
Guarantors of Indebtedness Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 creates new disclosure
and liability recognition requirements for certain guarantees, including,
obligations to stand ready to perform. The initial recognition and measurement
requirements of FIN 45 is effective prospectively for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002 and the disclosure requirements are effective
for financial statement periods ending after December 15, 2002. In accordance
with FIN 45, we have disclosed guarantee information.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN
46”), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities as
defined in the Interpretation. FIN 46 requires an assessment of equity
investments to determine if they are variable interest entities. FIN 46 is
immediately effective for all variable interest entities created after January
31, 2003. For variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied no later than the beginning of the first
interim period or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In
addition, if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or
disclose information about a variable interest entity, the enterprise shall
discuss the following information in all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003: (i) the nature, purpose, size or activities of the variable
interest entity and (ii) the enterprise’s maximum exposure to loss as a result
of its involvement with the variable interest entity. We are currently
evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 46 will have on
our financial position and results of operations.

Seasonality

Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription
television service industry, our first six months generally produce fewer new
subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any
period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses
that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues in the short-term until
the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods.

Inflation

Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three
years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our
products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive
pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products.



Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2002, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash
equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of
approximately $2.8 billion. Of that amount, a total of approximately $2.7
billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government
and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average
maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating
categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the
commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing
activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund
operations. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly
as cash is received and used in our business.

The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted
by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic
markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the
companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the
high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies),
reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by
interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2002, all of our investments in
this category were in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type
accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely
impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold
these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate
fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant gains or
losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of
reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds
would be re-invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Over time, any
net percentage decrease in interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding
net percentage decrease in our interest income. As of December 31, 2002 our
marketable securities portfolio balance was approximately $2.8 billion with an
average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2002 of approximately
2.6%. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease
of approximately $7 million in annual interest income.

We also invest in debt and equity of public and private companies for
strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2002, we held strategic
and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value
of approximately $73 million. We may make additional strategic and financial
investments in other debt and equity securities in the future.

The fair value of our strategic debt investments can be impacted by
interest rate fluctuations. Absent the effect of other factors, a hypothetical
10% increase in LIBOR would result in a decrease in the fair value of our
investments in these debt instruments of approximately $4.9 million. The fair
value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can also be
significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets
generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose
securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and
other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in
fair market value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the
underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of our
public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a
$7.3 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale marketable investment securities to
fair market value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses
as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit, net of related deferred
income tax, if applicable. Declines in the fair market value of a marketable
investment security which are estimated to be “other than temporary” must be
recognized in the statement of operations, thus establishing a new cost basis
for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities
portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the market
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation
consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable
investment securities compared to the carrying value of these securities, the
historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company
specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors
to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for
a period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in
the fair value of investments for a period of six to nine months are evaluated
on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market-specific
factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary.
Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for greater than
nine



months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to
earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2002, we recorded unrealized gains of approximately $6
million as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit. During the year
ended December 31, 2002, we also recorded an aggregate charge to earnings for
other than temporary declines in the fair market value of certain of our
marketable investment securities of approximately $117 million, and established
a new cost basis for these securities. This amount does not include realized
gains of approximately $12 million on the sales of marketable investment
securities. Our approximately $2.8 billion of restricted and unrestricted
cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities include debt and
equity securities which we own for strategic and financial purposes. The fair
market value of these strategic marketable investment securities aggregated
approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2002. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, our portfolio generally, and our strategic investments
particularly, experienced and continue to experience, volatility. If the fair
market value of our marketable securities portfolio does increase to cost basis
or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate
that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be
required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods equal to
the amount of the decline in fair value.

We also have made strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable
investment securities. The securities of these companies are not publicly
traded. Our ability to create realizable value from our strategic investments
in companies that are not public is dependent on the success of their business
and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans.
Since private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also
increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when
we desire to sell them that we will not be able to obtain full value for them.
We evaluate our non-marketable investment securities on a quarterly basis to
determine whether the carrying value of each investment is impaired. This
quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company
business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors
which may indicate an impairment in our investment. Such factors may include,
but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of
debt covenants and changes in business strategy.

We made a strategic investment in StarBand Communications, Inc. During
the first quarter of 2002, we determined that the carrying value of our
investment in StarBand, net of approximately $8 million of equity in losses of
StarBand already recorded during 2002, was not recoverable and recorded an
impairment charge of approximately $28 million to reduce the carrying value of
our StarBand investment to zero. This determination was based, among other
things, on our continuing evaluation of StarBand’s business model, including
further deterioration of StarBand’s limited available cash, combined with
increasing cash requirements, resulting in a critical need for additional
funding, with no clear path to obtain that cash. Further, during April 2002,
we changed our sales and marketing relationship with StarBand and ceased
subsidizing StarBand equipment. StarBand subsequently filed for bankruptcy
during June 2002.

As of December 31, 2002, we estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate
debt and mortgages and other notes payable to be approximately $5.9 billion
using quoted market prices where available, or discounted cash flow analyses.
The interest rates assumed in such discounted cash flow analyses reflect
interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to
borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and
mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10%
decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by
approximately $200 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs
of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our
debt. As of December 31, 2002, a hypothetical 10% increase in assumed interest
rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $46 million.

We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. We have not hedged or otherwise protected against the risks
associated with any of our investing or financing activities.

issuance. In addition, during 1995 and 2001 we adopted Nonemployee Director
Plans to provide incentive to attract and retain our Nonemployee Directors. We
currently have reserved 240,000 shares and 250,000 shares of our class A common
stock related to the 1995 and 2001 Nonemployee Director Plans, respectively.
In 2002, we adopted our Class B CEO Stock Option Plan, under which we have
reserved 20 million shares of our class B common stock for issuance. No
options have been granted to date under our Class B CEO Stock Option Plan.

2001 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan

Our 2001 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan was adopted in 2001 by
EchoStar’s Board of Directors (our “Board”), effective as of June 12, 2001, to
attract and retain qualified persons who are not our employees for service as
members of our Board. The plan is administered by a committee consisting of
members of our Board (the “Committee”). Upon initial election or appointment
eligible non-employee directors are granted options to purchase 10,000 shares
of our Class A common stock, effective as of the last day of the calendar
quarter in which such person is elected or appointed to our Board. The
Committee has discretion to make further option grants to plan participants.
However no non-employee director may be awarded options to purchase more than
10,000 shares in any twelve month period. The exercise price of options
granted under the plan is 100% of the fair market value of our Class A common
stock as of the last day of the calendar quarter in which the non-employee
director receiving the option is elected, appointed or reelected to our Board,
as applicable. We currently have reserved 250,000 shares of our class A common
stock for granting awards under this plan. All options granted under the plan
expire not later than five years after the date of grant and typically vest
immediately upon grant.

Additional information required by this Item will be set forth in our
Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 6,
2003, under the captions “Election of Directors” and “Equity Security
Ownership,” which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

There have been no significant changes (including corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our

REPORT OF KPMG LLP, INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the 2002 financial statements of Echostar Communications
Corporation as listed in the accompanying index. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The 2001
and 2000 financial statements of Echostar Communications Corporation as listed
in the accompanying index were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations. Those auditors’ report, dated February 27, 2002, on these
financial statements was unqualified and included an explanatory note that
stated that they did not audit the financial statements of Starband
Communications, Inc., an investment using the equity method of accounting which
was reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Echostar
Communications Corporation as of December 31, 2002, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

REPORT OF ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP, INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The below report is a copy of a previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP report
and this report has not been reissued.

To EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar
Communications Corporation (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of StarBand
Communications Inc., the investment in which is reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2001 using the equity method of accounting. The investment in StarBand
Communications Inc. represents approximately 0.6% percent of total assets as of
December 31, 2001, and the equity in its net losses represents approximately
16.7% percent of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001. The financial
statements of StarBand Communications Inc. were audited by other auditors whose
report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for StarBand Communications Inc., is based solely on the
report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of EchoStar Communications
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Business Activities

Principal Business

The operations of EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC,” and together
with its subsidiaries, or referring to particular subsidiaries in certain
circumstances, “EchoStar” or the “Company”) include two interrelated business
units:

•

The DISH Network

— a direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription
television service in the United States. and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”) — engaged in the design and
development of DBS set-top boxes, antennae and other digital equipment
for the DISH Network (“EchoStar receiver systems”) and the design,
development and distribution of similar equipment for international
satellite service providers.

Since 1994, EchoStar has deployed substantial resources to develop the
“EchoStar DBS System.” The EchoStar DBS System consists of EchoStar’s
FCC-allocated DBS spectrum, eight DBS satellites (“EchoStar I” through
“EchoStar VIII”), EchoStar receiver systems, digital broadcast operations
centers, customer service facilities, and other assets utilized in its
operations. EchoStar’s principal business strategy is to continue developing
its subscription television service in the United States to provide consumers
with a fully competitive alternative to cable television service.

Recent Developments

Termination of the Proposed Merger of EchoStar with Hughes

During October, 2001, EchoStar signed agreements with Hughes Electronics
Corporation (“Hughes”) and General Motors (“GM”), which is Hughes’ parent
company, related to a proposed merger with Hughes in a stock-for-stock
transaction.

On October 10, 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
announced that it had declined to approve the application for transfer of the
licenses necessary to allow our merger with Hughes to close and designated the
application for hearing by an administrative law judge. On October 31, 2002,
the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), twenty-three states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint for permanent injunctive relief in
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against EchoStar,
GM and Hughes.

On December 9, 2002, EchoStar reached a settlement with GM and Hughes to
terminate the proposed merger. In connection with the proposed merger and
subsequent termination, EchoStar recorded charges to earnings for the following
fees:

•

Termination fee: Upon termination of the merger, we recorded
a charge to earnings of approximately $690 million related to merger
termination costs. These costs consisted of a $600 million
termination fee paid to Hughes, approximately $57 million related to
capitalized merger costs which were charged to earnings upon
termination of the merger and approximately $33 million related to
unamortized bridge commitment fees, which were expensed upon
termination of the merger.

•

Bridge Commitment fees: In connection with the proposed
merger, EchoStar and Hughes obtained a $5.525 billion bridge
financing commitment and EchoStar paid approximately $55 million of
commitment fees. Approximately $7 million of deferred commitment
fees were expensed upon issuance of the 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009
by EchoStar DBS Corporation ("EDBS") and approximately $15 million of deferred commitment
fees were expensed upon closing of the $1.5 billion equity
investment in EchoStar by Vivendi. The remaining $33 million was
expensed upon termination of the merger explained above.

F-8


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

•

Ticking fees: A fee of .50% per year on the aggregate bridge
financing commitment outstanding was payable quarterly, in arrears,
until termination of the agreements relating to the bridge
commitments. These fees were expensed as incurred as a component of
interest expense. EchoStar recorded charges to earnings of
approximately $5 million and approximately $17 million during the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, related to
bridge financing ticking fees.

Under the terms of the settlement, Hughes retained its 81% ownership
interest in PanAmSat, which EchoStar was previously obligated to purchase at a
price of $22.47 per share, or approximately $2.7 billion.

Vivendi Universal

In connection with Vivendi’s purchase of our Series D convertible
preferred stock during January 2002, Vivendi received contingent value rights.
The terms of those rights provided that if, as of the settlement date specified
below, the average price of EchoStar’s class A common stock was above the
$26.04 class A common stock equivalent price per share paid by Vivendi, then no
amount would be payable to Vivendi. If the average price of EchoStar’s class A
common stock during the relevant 20 day period was below that price, then we
were obligated to pay Vivendi the difference between $26.04, the price paid by
Vivendi, and the then current average price of EchoStar’s class A common stock,
up to a maximum payment of $525 million. Any amount owed under these rights,
which was payable in cash or in EchoStar’s class A common stock at EchoStar’s
option, would have been settled 30 months after termination of the merger
agreement and the PanAmSat stock purchase agreement. The terms of the
contingent value rights also provided that, generally, in the event that the
price of EchoStar’s class A common stock was at or above $31.25 for 90
consecutive calendar days prior to maturity of the contingent value rights, the
rights automatically expired.

The class A common stock equivalent per share conversion price for the
Series D convertible preferred stock was set at $26.04 upon execution of the
investment agreement on December 14, 2001. Further, the effective class A
common stock equivalent per share value of the Series D convertible preferred
stock excluding the contingent value rights was calculated as $25.51. However,
the investment was not consummated until January 22, 2002, when the price of
EchoStar’s class A common stock was $26.58. Since the price as of the date of
consummation of the investment was above the effective per share value and
since consummation of the investment was contingent upon regulatory approval,
the Series D preferred stock was deemed to be issued with a beneficial
conversion feature. This feature required the difference between the effective
per share value and the price as of the date of consummation to be recorded as
a discount on the Series D convertible preferred stock. Since the Series D
convertible preferred stock was immediately convertible at the holder’s option,
the discount on Series D convertible preferred stock related to the beneficial
conversion feature was accreted as a charge to retained earnings of
approximately $61.9 million as of the date of issuance.

EchoStar used a Black-Scholes pricing model, a widely accepted tool which
is commonly used to value financial instruments such as options, warrants,
etc., and applied certain other assumptions and judgments to value the
contingent rights from the date of their issuance through December 17, 2002,
the date on which EchoStar and Vivendi agreed to a repurchase of this stake as
discussed below. Changes in the estimated value were recorded as charges to
earnings from January 22, 2002 through December 17, 2002. The contingent value
rights were originally assigned a value of $30.7 million. This amount was
recorded as a discount on the Series D convertible preferred stock at the date
of issuance. As of December 17, 2002, the estimated value of the contingent
value rights was approximately $62.3 million. The issuance costs of
approximately $16.5 million related to the Series D convertible preferred stock
were also recorded as a discount on the Series D convertible preferred stock at
the date of issuance.

Effective December 23, 2002, EchoStar repurchased Vivendi’s stake in
EchoStar. As part of this transaction, immediately prior to the repurchase
Vivendi converted its Series D Convertible Preferred stock into approximately
57.6 million shares of EchoStar class A Common stock. These shares were then
acquired by us at a price of $18.50 per common share, for a total transaction
price of approximately $1.066 billion. As a result of this transaction,
Vivendi’s contingent value rights terminated in accordance with the original
terms of the Contingent

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Value Rights Agreement. As a result of this
termination, all potential obligations associated with the contingent value
rights, which had a recorded estimated fair value of approximately $171 million
as of September 30, 2002 and $62.3 million as of December 17, 2002, the date on
which we and Vivendi agreed to the repurchase, were eliminated.

As of December 17, 2002, the Series D convertible preferred stock was
carried on EchoStar’s balance sheet at approximately $1.453 billion, including
the $61.9 million beneficial conversion feature, and had a fair market value of
approximately $1.256 billion. The contingent value rights were carried at
their estimated fair value of $62.3 million, and the beneficial conversion
feature was carried at approximately $61.9 million. The consideration paid to
Vivendi was allocated between the contingent value rights, the beneficial
conversion feature and the Series D convertible preferred stock. The
consideration of approximately $1.066 billion was allocated using a relative
fair value method which resulted in: (i) approximately $50.4 million of the
consideration being allocated to the contingent value rights and (ii)
approximately $1.015 billion being allocated to the Series D convertible
preferred stock and beneficial conversion feature. Of the approximately $1.015
billion allocated to the Series D convertible preferred stock and beneficial
conversion feature, approximately $61.9 million was first allocated to the
beneficial conversion feature and the remaining $953 million was allocated to
the Series D convertible preferred stock. The allocation to the contingent
value rights resulted in a credit to earnings of approximately $11.9 million,
which represents the difference between the consideration allocated to the
contingent value rights and their estimated value at December 17, 2002. The
allocation of consideration to the Series D convertible preferred stock and
beneficial conversion feature resulted in a credit to retained earnings and a
reduction of net loss attributable to common shareholders of approximately
$437.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which represents the difference between the consideration
allocated to the Series D convertible preferred stock and the beneficial
conversion feature and their aggregate carrying value at December 17, 2002.

Debt Exchange

Effective November 5, 2002, EDBS completed its offer to exchange all of
the $1 billion principal outstanding of EchoStar Broadband Corporation’s 10
3/8% Senior Notes due 2007 (the “EBC Notes”) for substantially identical notes
of EDBS. Tenders were received from holders of over 99% of the EBC Notes. In
accordance with the terms of the indenture related to the EBC Notes, since at
least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding EBC Notes accepted
the exchange offer, all of the then outstanding EBC Notes were deemed to have
been exchanged for EDBS Notes.

Organization and Legal Structure

During 1999, EchoStar placed ownership of all of its direct broadcast
satellites and related FCC licenses into subsidiaries of EDBS. Dish, Ltd. and
EchoStar Satellite Broadcasting Company were merged into EDBS. EchoStar IV and
the related FCC licenses were transferred to EchoStar Satellite Corporation.
During 2002, ownership of EchoStar VII and EchoStar VIII were transferred to
EDBS. Contracts for the construction and launch of EchoStar IX are held in
EchoStar Orbital Corporation II. Substantially all of EchoStar’s operations are
conducted by subsidiaries of EDBS.

Significant Risks and Uncertainties

Substantial Leverage.

EchoStar is highly leveraged, which makes it
vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions. As of December 31, 2002,
EchoStar had outstanding long-term debt (including both the current and
long-term portions) totaling approximately $5.7 billion. EchoStar has
semi-annual cash debt service obligations for all of its outstanding long-term
debt securities, as follows:

*Effective February 1, 2003, these notes were redeemed. See Note 14 –
Subsequent Events for further discussion.

Semi-annual debt service requirements related to EchoStar’s 9 1/8% Senior
Notes due 2009 commenced on July 15, 2002. There are no scheduled principal
payment or sinking fund requirements prior to maturity of any of these notes.
EchoStar’s ability to meet its debt service obligations will depend on, among
other factors, the successful execution of its business strategy, which is
subject to uncertainties and contingencies beyond EchoStar’s control.

Expected Operating Losses.

Since 1996, EchoStar has reported significant
operating and net losses. Improvements in EchoStar’s future results of
operations are largely dependent upon its ability to increase its customer base
while maintaining its overall cost structure, controlling subscriber turnover
and effectively managing its subscriber acquisition costs. The high cost of
obtaining new subscribers magnifies the negative effects of subscriber
turnover. No assurance can be given that EchoStar will be effective with
regard to these matters.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
EchoStar and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. EchoStar accounts
for investments in 50% or less owned entities using the equity or cost method,
except for its investments in marketable equity securities, which are carried
at fair value.

F-11


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

During the three months ended June 30, 2002, EchoStar recorded an
adjustment to “Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies” of approximately
$17 million to reduce accrued royalty expenses related to the production of
EchoStar receiver systems. The reduction in accrued royalty expenses primarily
resulted from the completion of royalty arrangements with more favorable terms
than the estimate previously accrued.

During the three months ended September 30, 2002, as a result of favorable
litigation developments, EchoStar recorded a non-recurring reduction in the
cost of set-top box equipment. The following details the decrease in the
financial statement line items affected by this adjustment (in thousands):

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses

The functional currency of the majority of EchoStar’s foreign subsidiaries
is the U.S. dollar because their sales and purchases are predominantly
denominated in that currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction
gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on
period-end translation) or realized (upon settlement of the transaction). Net
transaction gains (losses) during 2000, 2001 and 2002 were not material to
EchoStar’s results of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

EchoStar considers all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of
their maturity to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of December 31,
2001 and 2002 consist of money market funds, corporate notes and commercial
paper. The cost of these investments approximates their fair market value.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Investment Securities and Restricted Cash

EchoStar currently classifies all marketable investment securities as
available-for-sale. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, EchoStar adjusts the carrying value of its available-for-sale
marketable investment securities to fair market value and reports the related
temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’
deficit, net of related deferred income tax, if applicable. Declines in the
fair market value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be
“other than temporary” must be recognized in the statement of operations, thus
establishing a new cost basis for such investment. EchoStar evaluates its
marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine
whether declines in the market value of these securities are other than
temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other
things, the fair value of EchoStar’s marketable investment securities compared
to the carrying value of these securities, the historical volatility of the
price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to
each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in
the fair value of investments below cost basis for a period of less than six
months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of
investments for a period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case
basis to determine whether any company or market-specific factors exist which
would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the
fair value of investments below cost basis for greater than nine months are
considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent
specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2002, EchoStar recorded unrealized gains of
approximately $6 million as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, EchoStar also recorded an aggregate
charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value
of certain of its marketable investment securities of approximately $117
million, and established a new cost basis for these securities. This amount
does not include realized gains of approximately $12 million on the sales of
marketable investment securities. EchoStar’s approximately $2.8 billion of
restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment
securities include debt and equity securities which EchoStar owns for strategic
and financial purposes. The fair market value of these strategic marketable
investment securities aggregated approximately $73 million as of December 31,
2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, EchoStar’s portfolio generally,
and EchoStar’s strategic investments particularly, experienced and continue to
experience volatility. If the fair market value of EchoStar’s marketable
securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if EchoStar becomes
aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying
value of certain of its securities is impaired, EchoStar may be required to
record additional charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of
the decline in fair value.

EchoStar also has made strategic equity investments in certain
non-marketable investment securities. The securities of these companies are
not publicly traded. EchoStar’s ability to create realizable value from its
strategic investments in companies that are not public is dependent on the
success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to
execute their business plans. Since private markets are not as liquid as
public markets, there is also increased risk that EchoStar will not be able to
sell these investments, or that when EchoStar desires to sell them that it will
not be able to obtain full value for them. EchoStar evaluates its
non-marketable investment securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether
the carrying value of each investment is impaired. This quarterly evaluation
consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current
financial statements, if available, for factors which may indicate an
impairment in EchoStar’s investment. Such factors may include, but are not
limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt
covenants and changes in business strategy.

EchoStar made a strategic investment in StarBand Communications, Inc.
During the first quarter of 2002, EchoStar determined that the carrying value
of its investment in StarBand, net of approximately $8 million of equity in
losses of StarBand already recorded during 2002, was not recoverable and
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $28 million to reduce the
carrying value of its StarBand investment to zero. This determination was
based, among other things, on EchoStar’s continuing evaluation of StarBand’s
business model, including further deterioration of StarBand’s limited available
cash, combined with increasing cash requirements, resulting in a critical need
for additional funding, with no clear path to obtain that cash. Further,
during April 2002, EchoStar changed its

StarBand and ceased subsidizing StarBand equipment. StarBand subsequently
filed for bankruptcy during June 2002.

Restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, include restricted cash placed in
trust for the purpose of repaying a note payable as of December 31, 2001 and

satellites under construction are capitalized during the construction phase,
assuming the eventual successful launch and in-orbit operation of the
satellite. If a satellite were to fail during launch or while in-orbit, the
resultant loss would be charged to expense in the period such loss was
incurred. The amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of
insurance proceeds received, if any, as a result of the launch or in-orbit
failure. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis

over lives ranging
from two to forty years. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense
when incurred. Renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Long-lived assets

EchoStar accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provision
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 44”). EchoStar reviews its
long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. For assets which are held and used in
operations, the asset would be impaired if the book value of the asset exceeded
the undiscounted future net cash flows related to the asset. Once an
impairment is determined, the actual impairment is measured using discounted
cash flows. Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. EchoStar considers
relevant cash flow, estimated future operating results, trends and other
available information including the fair value of frequency rights owned, in
assessing whether the carrying value of assets are recoverable.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“FAS 142”), which requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives to no longer be amortized but to be tested for impairment at least
annually. Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be
amortized over their estimated useful lives. The amortization and
non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 will be applied to all goodwill and
intangible assets acquired after September 30, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002,
EchoStar adopted the provisions of FAS 142 and ceased amortization of its FCC
authorizations, which were determined to have indefinite lives. In accordance
with FAS 142, EchoStar tested its FCC authorizations for impairment as of the
date of adoption and determined that there was no impairment. The following
table reconciles previously reported net income (loss) and basic and diluted
loss per common share as if the provisions of FAS 142 were in effect for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively, (in thousands).

As of December 31, 2001 and 2002, EchoStar had approximately $51 million
and $53 million of gross identifiable intangibles with related accumulated
amortization of approximately $22 million and $33 million as of the end of each
period, respectively. These identifiable intangibles primarily include
acquired contracts and technology-based intangibles. Amortization of these
intangible assets with an average finite useful life of approximately five
years was $10 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2002, respectively. EchoStar estimates that such amortization expense will
aggregate approximately $10 million annually for the remaining useful life of
these intangible assets of approximately 2 years. In addition, during the year
ended December 31, 2002 EchoStar’s business unit DISH Network acquired
approximately $3 million of goodwill.

Income Taxes

EchoStar establishes a provision for income taxes currently payable or
receivable and for income tax amounts deferred to future periods in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). FAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets or
liabilities be recorded for the estimated future tax effects of differences
that exist between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets are offset by valuation allowances in accordance with FAS 109.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair values for EchoStar’s high-yield debt are based on quoted market
prices. The fair values of EchoStar’s mortgages and other notes payable are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. The interest rates assumed in
such discounted cash flow analyses reflect interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs and Debt Discount

Costs of issuing debt are generally deferred and amortized to interest
expense over the terms of the respective notes (see Notes 4 and 14).

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from the provision of DISH Network subscription television
services and other satellite services is recognized as revenue in the period
such services are provided. Revenue from international sales of digital
set-top boxes and related accessories is recognized upon shipment to customers.
Specific revenue and subscriber acquisition cost recognition policies relating
to the significant marketing promotions for the period are discussed below.

I Like 9

– During August 2001, we commenced our I Like 9 promotion. Under
this promotion, subscribers who purchased an EchoStar receiver system for $199
or higher received free installation and either our America’s Top 100 CD or our
DISH Latino Dos programming package for $9 a month for the first year.
Subscriber acquisition costs are materially lower under this plan compared to
historical promotions. This promotion expired January 31, 2002.

Free Dish –

Our Free Dish promotion, under which subscribers receive a
free base-level EchoStar receiver system, commenced during August 2001. To be
eligible, subscribers must provide a valid major credit card and make a
one-year commitment to subscribe to a qualified programming package. Effective
July 13, 2002, eligible subscribers are able to purchase a second receiver for
$49.99.

1-2-3 Great TV –

During January 2002, we commenced our 1-2-3 Great TV
promotion. Under this promotion, subscribers who purchased one or more
receivers, provided a valid major credit card and made a one-year commitment,
received the first three months of qualified programming and installation of up
to two receivers for free. This promotion expired on July 31, 2002.

Free for All –

Effective August 1, 2002, we commenced our Free for All
promotion. Under this promotion, subscribers who purchase up to two receivers
for $149 or more, depending on the models chosen, and subscribe to a
qualifying programming package, receive free installation, together with
credits of $12.50 or $17.00 applied to their programming bill each month for a
year.

F-17


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Free Installation –

Under our free installation program all subscribers
who purchase an EchoStar receiver system are eligible to receive free
professional installation of up to two receivers.

Digital Home Plan –

Our Digital Home Plan promotion offers several choices
to consumers, ranging from the use of one EchoStar receiver system and our
America’s Top 50 CD programming package for $29.99 per month, to providing
consumers our America’s Top 150 programming package and two or more EchoStar
receiver systems for $52.99 to $62.99 per month. Each plan includes in-home
service, and the consumer must agree to a one-year commitment, provide a valid
major credit card, have an acceptable credit score and incur a one-time set-up
fee of $49.99. From January to July 2002, the promotion also included the
first three months of qualified programming free for qualified Digital Home
Plan programming packages and for an additional $99, consumers could also
choose to include a Dish PVR in the Digital Home Plan. Effective August 1,
2002, the one-time set-up fee includes only the first month’s qualified
programming payment and for an additional $50, consumers can also choose to
include a Dish PVR in the Digital Home Plan. Dish PVR receivers include a
built-in hard drive that allows viewers to pause and record live programming
without the need for videotape. Since EchoStar retains ownership of equipment
installed pursuant to the Digital Home Plan promotion, equipment costs are
capitalized and depreciated over a period of approximately four years.
Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Digital
Home Plan promotion, we expect it to continue through at least July 31, 2003.

EchoStar’s promotions which include programming discounts fall under the
scope of EITF Issue No. 00-14, “Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives” (“EITF
00-14”). In accordance with EITF 00-14, programming revenue under these
promotions are recorded at the discounted monthly rate charged to the
subscriber. See Subscriber Promotions Subsidies and Subscriber Acquisition
Costs below for discussion regarding the accounting for costs under these
promotions.

EchoStar’s dealer sales under its I like 9, Free Dish, 1-2-3 Great TV, and
Free for All fall under the scope of EITF Issue No. 00-25, “Vendor Income
Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products” (“EITF 00-25”). In accordance with the consensus guidance for Issue 2
of EITF 00-25, “buydowns” should be characterized as a reduction of revenue.
As such, certain commissions and equipment reimbursements paid to dealers are
recorded as a reduction of the net proceeds received by EchoStar from the
dealers. See additional discussion under Subscriber Promotions Subsidies and
Subscriber Acquisition Costs below.

StarBand.

Effective September 27, 2001, in connection with EchoStar’s
increased equity interest in StarBand, EchoStar began subsidizing the cost of
equipment to the subscriber by offering discounted equipment through its
independent dealers. As such, beginning September 27, 2001, EchoStar accounted
for the sale of StarBand equipment similar to the accounting for its dealer
sales under the I like 9, 1-2-3 Great TV and Free for All promotions. EchoStar
offered a bundled price of $100.99 for EchoStar’s America’s Top 150 (“AT 150”)
programming and the Starband Internet service. For StarBand customers who
activated for this bundled price, as a retailer of the StarBand service,
EchoStar recognized the entire $100.99 of revenue for the video and Internet
service and recorded costs equal to the monthly payment made by EchoStar to
Starband for providing the service. In the event EchoStar did not collect the
monthly programming and Internet payments from a subscriber, EchoStar was still
obligated to remit payment to Starband for the cost of providing the Internet
service to the customer.

Subscriber Promotion Subsidies and Subscriber Acquisition Costs

“Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies” includes the cost of
EchoStar receiver systems distributed to retailers and other distributors of
EchoStar’s equipment and receiver systems sold directly by EchoStar to
subscribers.
“Other subscriber promotion subsidies” includes net costs related to various
installation promotions and other promotional incentives. EchoStar makes
payments to its independent dealers as consideration for equipment installation
services and for equipment buydowns (commissions and rebates). EchoStar
expenses payments for equipment installation services as “Other subscriber
promotion subsidies”. EchoStar’s payments for equipment buydowns represent a
partial or complete return of the dealer’s purchase price and are, therefore,
netted against the proceeds received from the dealer. EchoStar reports the net
cost from its various sales promotions through its independent dealer

network
as a component of “Other subscriber promotion subsidies”. No proceeds from the
sale of subscriber related equipment is recognized as revenue. Accordingly,
subscriber acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred except for
under EchoStar’s Digital Home Plan which was initiated during 2000 wherein the
Company retains title to the receiver and certain other equipment resulting in
the capitalization and depreciation of such equipment cost over its estimated
useful life.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development costs totaled $17 million, $19 million and $33 million for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

EchoStar has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB 25”) and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 7. Under APB 25, EchoStar generally does not
recognize compensation expense on the issuance of stock under its Stock
Incentive Plan because the option terms are typically fixed and typically the
exercise price equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on
the date of grant. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting and Disclosure of
Stock-Based Compensation,” (“FAS No. 123”) which established an alternative
method of expense recognition for stock-based compensation awards to employees
based on fair values. EchoStar elected to not adopt FAS No. 123 for expense
recognition purposes.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS No. 123 and has been determined as if EchoStar had accounted
for its stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed
by that statement. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period.
All options are initially assumed to vest. Compensation previously recognized
is reversed to the extent applicable to forfeitures of unvested options. The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if
EchoStar had accounted for its stock-based compensation plans using the fair
value method prescribed by FAS 123 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

F-19


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

For purposes of this pro forma presentation, the fair value of each option
grant was estimated at the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of stock-based compensation awards.

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”
(“FAS 128”) requires entities to present both basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
and diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised or
convertible securities were converted to common stock. EchoStar had net losses
for the years ending December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Therefore, the effect
of the common stock equivalents and convertible securities is excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share since the effect is
anti-dilutive.

Earnings per share amounts for all periods are presented below in
accordance with the requirements of FAS 128.

As of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, options to purchase approximately
25,118,000; 22,748,000 and 20,829,000 shares of class A common stock were
outstanding, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”), which will require companies to
record exit, including restructuring, or disposal costs when they are incurred
and can be measured at fair value, and subsequently adjust the recorded
liability for changes in estimated cash flows. FAS 146 also provides specific
guidance on accounting for employee and contract terminations that are part of
restructuring activities. The new requirements in FAS 146 are effective
prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002. The application of FAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on
EchoStar’s financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” (“FAS 148”), which (i)
amends FAS Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to
provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily
changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation (ii) amends the disclosure provisions of FAS 123 to require
prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s
accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation
and (iii) amends APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require
disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. Items (ii)
and (iii) of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. EchoStar has
included the requirements of item (ii) in Note 2 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and will include the requirements of item (iii) beginning
in its first interim period after December 15, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirement for Guarantors, including Indirect
Guarantors of Indebtedness Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 creates new disclosure
and liability recognition requirements for certain guarantees, including,
obligations to stand ready to perform. The initial recognition and measurement
requirements of FIN 45 is effective prospectively for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002 and the disclosure requirements are effective
for financial statement periods ending after December 15, 2002. In accordance
with FIN 45, EchoStar has disclosed guarantee information.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN
46”), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities as
defined in the Interpretation. FIN 46 requires an assessment of equity
investments to determine if they are variable interest entities. FIN 46 is
immediately effective for all variable interest entities created after January
31, 2003. For variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied no later than the beginning of the first
interim period or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In
addition, if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or
disclose information about a variable interest entity, the enterprise shall
discuss the following information in all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003: (i) the nature, purpose, size or activities of the variable
interest entity and (ii) the enterprise’s maximum exposure to loss as a result
of its involvement with the variable interest entity. EchoStar is currently
evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 46 will have on
its financial position and results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Cost of sales and operating expense categories included in EchoStar’s
accompanying consolidated statements of operations do not include depreciation
expense related to satellites or digital home plan equipment.

EchoStar III

During January 2002, a transponder pair on EchoStar III failed, resulting
in a temporary interruption of service. The operation of the satellite was
quickly restored. Including five transponders pairs that malfunctioned in prior
years, these anomalies have resulted in the failure of a total of 12
transponders on the satellite to date. While a maximum of 32 transponders can
be operated at any time, the satellite was equipped with a total of 44
transponders to provide redundancy. In addition, we are only licensed by the
FCC to operate 11 transponders at the 61.5 degree orbital location (together
with an additional six leased transponders). We will continue to evaluate the
performance of EchoStar III.

EchoStar V

During 2000 and 2001, EchoStar V experienced anomalies resulting in the
loss of two solar array strings, and during August 2002, EchoStar V experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array string. The
satellite has a total of approximately 96 solar array strings and approximately
92 are required to assure full power availability for the estimated 12-year
design life of the satellite. In addition, during January 2003, EchoStar V
experienced an anomaly in a spacecraft electronic component which affects the
ability to receive telemetry from certain on-board equipment. Other methods of
communication have been established to alleviate the effects of the failed
component. An investigation of the solar array and electronic component
anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the satellite,
is continuing. Until the root cause of these anomalies is finally determined,
there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses which
could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VI

During 2001, EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of
two solar array strings, and during July 2002, EchoStar VI experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array string. The
satellite has a total of approximately 112 solar array strings and
approximately 106 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year design life of the satellite. An investigation of the solar
array anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the
satellite, is continuing. Until the root cause of these anomalies is finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VIII

During October 2002, EchoStar VIII, which launched successfully on August
21, 2002 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, reached its final orbital
location at 110 degrees West Longitude and commenced commercial operation after
completing in-orbit testing.

During September and October 2002, two of the thrusters on EchoStar VIII
experienced anomalous events and are not currently in use. The satellite is
equipped with a total of 12 thrusters that help control spacecraft location,
attitude, and pointing and is currently operating using a combination of the
other 10 thrusters. This workaround requires more frequent maneuvers to
maintain the satellite at its specified orbital location, which are less
efficient and therefore result in accelerated fuel use. In addition, the
workaround will require certain gyroscopes to be utilized for aggregate periods
of time in excess of their originally qualified limits. However, neither of
these workarounds are expected to significantly reduce the estimated 12-year
design life of the satellite. An investigation of the thruster anomalies
including the development of additional workarounds for long term operations is
continuing. None of these events has impacted commercial operation of the
satellite to date. Until the root cause of these anomalies has been finally

determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

Satellite Insurance

As a result of the failure of EchoStar IV solar arrays to fully deploy and
the failure of 38 transponders to date, a maximum of 6 of the 44 transponders
(including spares) on EchoStar IV are available for use at this time. In
addition to transponder and solar array failures, EchoStar IV experienced
anomalies affecting its thermal systems and propulsion system. There can be no
assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use, of EchoStar
IV will not occur in the immediate future. Currently no programming is being
transmitted to customers on EchoStar IV, and the satellite functions as an
in-orbit spare.

In September 1998, EchoStar filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a
total loss under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The
satellite insurance consists of separate substantially identical policies with
different carriers for varying amounts that, in combination, create a total
insured amount of $219.3 million. The insurance carriers include La Reunion
Spatiale; AXA Reinsurance Company (n/k/a AXA Corporate Solutions Reinsurance
Company), United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc., United States Aircraft
Insurance Group; Assurances Generales De France I.A.R.T. (AGF); Certain
Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London; Great Lakes Reinsurance (U.K.) PLC; British
Aviation Insurance Group; If Skaadeforsikring (previously Storebrand); Hannover
Re (a/k/a International Hannover); The Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Company,
Ltd.; Marham Space Consortium (a/k/a Marham Consortium Management); Ace Global
Markets (a/k/a Ace London); M.C. Watkins Syndicate; Goshawk Syndicate
Management Ltd.; D.E. Hope Syndicate 10009 (Formerly Busbridge); Amlin
Aviation; K.J. Coles & Others; H.R. Dumas & Others; Hiscox Syndicates, Ltd.;
Cox Syndicate; Hayward Syndicate; D.J. Marshall & Others; TF Hart; Kiln;
Assitalia Le Assicurazioni D’Italia S.P.A. Roma; La Fondiaria Assicurazione
S.P.A., Firenze; Vittoria Assicurazioni S.P.A., Milano; Ras — Riunione
Adriatica Di Sicurta S.P.A., Milano; Societa Cattolica Di Assicurazioni,
Verano; Siat Assicurazione E Riassicurazione S.P.A, Genova; E. Patrick; ZC
Specialty Insurance; Lloyds of London Syndicates 588 NJM, 1209 Meb AND 861 Meb;
Generali France Assurances; Assurance France Aviation; and Ace Bermuda
Insurance Ltd.

The insurance carriers offered us a total of approximately $88 million, or
40% of the total policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance
claim. The insurers assert, among other things, that EchoStar IV was not a
total loss, as that term is defined in the policy, and that we did not abide by
the exact terms of the insurance policies. EchoStar strongly disagrees and
filed arbitration claims against the insurers for breach of contract, failure
to pay a valid insurance claim and bad faith denial of a valid claim, among
other things. Due to individual forum selection clauses in certain of the
policies, EchoStar is pursuing its arbitration claims against Ace Bermuda
Insurance Ltd. in London, England, and its arbitration claims against all of
the other insurance carriers in New York, New York. The New York arbitration
is currently scheduled to begin in late April 2003, but the Insurers have
recently requested that that hearing date be delayed. The parties to the
London arbitration are currently negotiating the schedule for a hearing, and,
while there can be no assurance, EchoStar anticipates that the hearing date in
that proceeding will be set for later in 2003. There can be no assurance that
EchoStar will receive the amount claimed in either the New York or the London
arbitrations or, if EchoStar does, that EchoStar will retain title to EchoStar
IV with its reduced capacity.

At the time EchoStar filed its claim in 1998, EchoStar recognized an
impairment loss of $106 million to write-down the carrying value of the
satellite and related costs, and simultaneously recorded an insurance claim
receivable for the same amount. EchoStar will have to reduce the amount of the
receivable if a final settlement is reached for less than this amount.

As a result of the thermal and propulsion system anomalies, EchoStar
reduced the estimated remaining useful life of EchoStar IV to approximately 4
years during January 2000. EchoStar will continue to evaluate the performance
of EchoStar IV and may modify its loss assessment as new events or
circumstances develop.

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

The indentures related to certain of EDBS’ senior notes contain
restrictive covenants that require EchoStar to maintain satellite insurance
with respect to at least half of the satellites it owns or leases. All of
EchoStar’s eight in-orbit DBS satellites are currently owned by direct or
indirect subsidiaries of EDBS. Insurance coverage is therefore required for at
least four of EchoStar’s eight satellites. The launch and/or in-orbit
insurance policies for EchoStar I through EchoStar VIII have expired. EchoStar
has been unable to obtain insurance on any of these satellites on terms
acceptable to EchoStar. As a result, EchoStar is currently self-insuring these
satellites. To satisfy insurance covenants related to EDBS’ senior notes,
EchoStar has reclassified an amount equal to the depreciated cost of four of
its satellites from cash and cash equivalents to cash reserved for satellite
insurance on its balance sheet. As of December 31, 2002, cash
reserved for satellite insurance totaled approximately $151 million. The
reclassifications will continue until such time, if ever, as EchoStar can again
insure its satellites on acceptable terms and for acceptable amounts, or until
the covenants requiring the insurance are no longer applicable.

4. Long-Term Debt

9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes

On January 25, 1999, EDBS sold $375 million principal amount of the 9 1/4%
Seven Year Notes which mature February 1, 2006 and $1.625 billion principal
amount of the 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes which mature February 1, 2009. Interest
accrues at annual rates of 9 1/4% and 9 3/8%, respectively, and is payable
semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year,
commencing August 1, 1999.

Concurrently with the closing of the 9 1/4% Seven Year Notes and 9 3/8%
Ten Year Notes offering, EchoStar used approximately $1.658 billion of net
proceeds received from the sale of the 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year
Notes to complete tender offers for its then outstanding senior notes issued in
1994, 1996 and 1997. In February 1999, EchoStar used approximately $268
million of net proceeds received from the sale of the 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9
3/8% Ten Year Notes to complete the tender offers related to the 12 1/8% Senior
Exchange Notes due 2004, issued on January 4, 1999, in exchange for all issued
and outstanding 12 1/8% Series B Senior Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred
Stock.

With the exception of certain de minimis domestic and foreign
subsidiaries, the 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes are fully,
unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by all subsidiaries of
EDBS. The 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes are general senior
unsecured obligations which:

•

rank

pari passu

in right of payment to each other and to all
existing and future senior unsecured obligations;

•

rank senior to all existing and future junior obligations;
and

•

are effectively junior to secured obligations to the extent
of the collateral securing such obligations, including any
borrowings under future secured credit facilities.

Except under certain circumstances requiring prepayment premiums, and in
other limited circumstances, the 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes
are not redeemable at EDBS’ option prior to February 1, 2003 and February 1,
2004, respectively. The 9 1/4% Seven Year Notes are subject to redemption, at
the option of EDBS, in whole or in part, at redemption prices decreasing from
104.625% during the year commencing February 1, 2003 to 100% on or after
February 1, 2005, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
redemption date. EDBS elected to retire all of its outstanding 9 1/4 % Senior
Notes due 2006, three years early pursuant to its optional early redemption
right (Note 14). The 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes are subject to redemption, at the
option of EDBS, in whole or in part, at redemption prices decreasing from
104.688% during the year commencing February 1, 2004 to 100% on or after
February 1, 2008, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
redemption date.

The indentures related to the 9 1/4% Seven Year and 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes
(the “Seven and Ten Year Notes Indentures”) contain restrictive covenants that,
among other things, impose limitations on the ability of EDBS to:

In addition, EDBS may pay dividends on its equity securities only if no
default shall have occurred or is continuing under the Seven and Ten Year Notes
Indentures; and after giving effect to such dividend and the incurrence of any
indebtedness (the proceeds of which are used to finance the dividend), EDBS’
ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (calculated in accordance with the
Indentures) would not exceed 8.0 to 1.0. Moreover, the aggregate amount of
such dividends generally may not exceed the sum of the difference of cumulative
consolidated cash flow (calculated in accordance with the Indentures) minus
120% of consolidated interest expense of EDBS (calculated in accordance with
the Indentures) in each case from April 1, 1999, plus an amount equal to 100%
of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by EDBS and its subsidiaries from
the issuance or sale of certain equity interests of EDBS or EchoStar.

In the event of a change of control, as defined in the Seven and Ten Year
Notes Indentures, EDBS will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of
the 9 3/8% Ten Year Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to
the date of repurchase.

10 3/8% Seven Year Notes

On September 25, 2000, our wholly-owned subsidiary, EchoStar Broadband
Corporation (“EBC”), sold $1 billion principal amount of the 10 3/8% Seven Year
Notes which mature October 1, 2007. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 10
3/8% and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1
of each year. The proceeds of the 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes will be used
primarily by EchoStar’s subsidiaries for the construction and launch of
additional satellites, strategic acquisitions and other general working capital
purposes.

Under the terms of the 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes Indenture, EBC agreed to
cause its subsidiary, EDBS to make an offer to exchange (the “EDBS Exchange
Offer”) all of the outstanding 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes for a new class of
notes issued by EDBS as soon as practical following the first date (as
reflected in EDBS’ most recent quarterly or annual financial statements) on
which EDBS was permitted to incur indebtedness in an amount equal to the
outstanding principal balance of the 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes under the
“Indebtedness to Cash Flow Ratio” test contained in the indentures (the “EDBS
Indentures”) governing the EDBS 9 1/4% Seven Year Notes and 9 3/8% Ten Year
Notes, and such incurrence of indebtedness would not otherwise cause any breach
or violation of, or result in a default under, the terms of the EDBS
Indentures.

Effective November 5, 2002, EDBS completed its offer to exchange all of
the $1 billion principal outstanding of EBC’s 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes for
substantially identical notes of EDBS. Tenders were received from holders of
over 99% of the EBC Notes. Per the terms of the indenture related to the EBC
Notes, if at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding EBC
Notes have accepted the exchange offer, then all of the then outstanding EBC
Notes shall be deemed to have been exchanged for the EDBS Notes.

Except under certain circumstances requiring prepayment premiums, and in
other limited circumstances, the 10 3/8% Seven Year Notes are not redeemable at
EchoStar’s option prior to October 1, 2004. Thereafter, the 10 3/8% Seven Year
Notes will be subject to redemption, at EchoStar’s option, in whole or in part,
at redemption prices decreasing from 105.188% during the year commencing
October 1, 2004 to 100% on or after October 1, 2006, together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

future payments under these
guarantees are equal to the respective amounts of outstanding principal and
accrued interest.

5. Income Taxes

As of December 31, 2002, EchoStar had net operating loss carryforwards
(“NOL’s”) for federal income tax purposes of approximately $3.082 billion and
capital loss and credit carryforwards of approximately $9 million. The NOL’s
begin to expire in the year 2011 and capital loss and credit carryforwards will
begin to expire in the year 2006.

During 2002, EchoStar increased its valuation allowance by approximately
$289 million to fully offset all net deferred tax assets. Included in this
increase is $222 million relating to deferred tax assets generated during 2002
and $67 million relating to the balance of the net deferred tax asset that was
not offset by a valuation allowance at December 31, 2001.

The federal NOL includes amounts related to tax deductions totaling
approximately $160 million for exercised stock options. The tax benefit of
these deductions has been allocated directly to contributed capital and has
been offset by a valuation allowance.

During 2002, stock option compensation expenses related to the 1999
Incentive Plan, for which an estimated deferred tax benefit was previously
recorded, exceeded the actual tax deductions allowed. Tax charges associated
with the reversal of the prior tax benefit have been allocated to additional
paid-in capital in accordance with Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. During 2002, a charge of $7
million was made to additional paid-in capital.

The components of the (provision for) benefit from income taxes are as

Internal Revenue Service

During 2001 the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) conducted an audit of
EchoStar’s consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1997, 1998,
and 1999. As a result of this review the IRS challenged the timing of
deduction of certain subscriber acquisition costs. In July 2002, EchoStar
received notification from the IRS of their decision to allow the deduction of
the subscriber acquisition costs in accordance with EchoStar’s filed returns.

6. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)

Common Stock

The class A, class B and class C common stock are equivalent in all
respects except voting rights. Holders of class A and class C common stock are
entitled to one vote per share and holders of class B common stock are entitled
to 10 votes per share. Each share of class B and class C common stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of class A common
stock. Upon a change in control of ECC, each holder of outstanding shares of
class C common stock is entitled to 10 votes for each share of class C common
stock held. ECC’s principal stockholder owns all outstanding class B common
stock and all other stockholders own class A common stock. There are no shares
of class C common stock outstanding.

7. Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Incentive Plan

EchoStar has adopted stock incentive plans to provide incentive to attract
and retain officers, directors and key employees. EchoStar currently has
reserved 80 million shares of its class A common stock for granting awards
under its 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and an additional 80 million shares of its
class A common stock for granting awards under its 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.
In general, stock options granted through December 31, 2002 have included
exercise prices not less than the fair market value of EchoStar’s class A
common stock at the date of grant, and vest, as determined by EchoStar’s Board
of Directors, generally at the rate of 20% per year.

During 1999, EchoStar adopted an incentive plan under its 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan, which provided certain key employees a contingent incentive
including stock options and cash. The payment of these incentives was
contingent upon the achievement of certain financial and other goals of
EchoStar. EchoStar met certain of these goals during 1999. Accordingly, in
1999, EchoStar recorded approximately $179 million of deferred compensation
related to post-grant appreciation of options to purchase approximately 4.2
million shares. The related deferred compensation, net of forfeitures, will be
recognized over the five-year vesting period. During the year ended December
31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, EchoStar recognized expense of $51 million, $20
million and $11 million, respectively, under the 1999 incentive plan. The
remaining deferred compensation of $9 million, which will be reduced by future
forfeitures, if any, will be recognized over the remaining vesting period.

EchoStar reports all non-cash compensation based on stock option
appreciation as a single expense category in our accompanying statements of
operations. The following table represents the other expense categories in our
statements of operations that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based
compensation was allocated to the same expense categories as the base
compensation for key employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan (in
thousands):

certain longer-term goals
which have not yet been achieved. Consequently, no compensation was recorded
during the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 related to these
long-term options. EchoStar will record the
related compensation at the achievement of the performance goals. Such
compensation, if recorded, would likely result in material non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense in our statements of operations.

8. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved an employee
stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), effective beginning October 1, 1997. Under
the ESPP, EchoStar is authorized to issue a total of 800,000 shares of class A
common stock. Substantially all full-time employees who have been employed by
EchoStar for at least one calendar quarter are eligible to participate in the
ESPP. Employee stock purchases are made through payroll deductions. Under the
terms of the ESPP, employees may not deduct an amount which would permit such
employee to purchase capital stock of EchoStar under all stock purchase plans
of EchoStar at a rate which would exceed $25,000 in fair market value of
capital stock in any one year. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the

F-33


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

closing price of the class A common stock on the last business day of each
calendar quarter in which such shares of class A common stock are deemed sold
to an employee under the ESPP. The ESPP shall terminate upon the first to
occur of (i) October 1, 2007 or (ii) the date on which the ESPP is terminated
by the Board of Directors. During
2000, 2001 and 2002 employees purchased approximately 58,000; 80,000 and
108,000 shares of class A common stock through the ESPP, respectively.

401(k) Employee Savings Plan

EchoStar sponsors a 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for
eligible employees. Voluntary employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be
matched 50% by EchoStar, subject to a maximum annual contribution by EchoStar
of $1,000 per employee. Matching 401(k) contributions totaled approximately
$1.6 million, $2.1 million and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31,
2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. EchoStar also may make an annual
discretionary contribution to the plan with approval by EchoStar’s Board of
Directors, subject to the maximum deductible limit provided by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These contributions may be made in cash or
in EchoStar stock. Forfeitures of unvested participant balances which
are retained by the 401(k) Plan may be used to fund matching and
discretionary contributions. Expense recognized relating to discretionary contributions
was approximately $7 million, $225 thousand and $17 million during the years
ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

Purchase Commitments

As of December 31, 2002, EchoStar’s purchase commitments totaled
approximately $359 million. The majority of these commitments relate to
EchoStar receiver systems and related components. All of the purchases related
to these commitments are expected to be made during 2003. EchoStar expects to
finance these purchases from existing unrestricted cash balances and future
cash flows generated from operations.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of EchoStar’s competitors, now have and may
in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover
or affect products or services directly or indirectly related to those that
EchoStar offers. EchoStar may not be aware of all patents and other
intellectual property rights that its products may potentially infringe.
Damages in patent infringement cases can include a tripling of actual damages
in certain cases. Further, EchoStar cannot estimate the extent to which it may
be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by
others and the availability and cost of any such licenses. Various parties
have asserted patent and other

F-34


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

intellectual property rights with respect to
components within EchoStar’s direct broadcast satellite system. EchoStar
cannot be certain that these persons do not own the rights they claim, that its
products do not infringe on these rights, that it would be able to obtain
licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if it was
unable to obtain such licenses, that it would be able to redesign its products
to avoid infringement.

Fee Dispute

EchoStar had a dispute regarding the contingent fee arrangement with the
attorneys who represented EchoStar in prior litigation with The News
Corporation, Ltd. In early July 2002, the parties resolved their dispute.

WIC Premium Television Ltd

During July 1998, a lawsuit was filed by WIC Premium Television Ltd., an
Alberta corporation, in the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division, against
General Instrument Corporation, HBO, Warner Communications, Inc., John Doe,
Showtime, United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc., EchoStar, and
certain EchoStar subsidiaries.

During September 1998, WIC filed another lawsuit in the Court of Queen’s
Bench of Alberta Judicial District of Edmonton against certain defendants,
including EchoStar. WIC is a company authorized to broadcast certain
copyrighted work, such as movies and concerts, to residents of Canada. WIC
alleges that the defendants engaged in, promoted, and/or allowed satellite dish
equipment from the United States to be sold in Canada and to Canadian residents
and that some of the defendants allowed and profited from Canadian residents
purchasing and viewing subscription television programming that is only
authorized for viewing in the United States. The lawsuit seeks, among other
things, interim and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendants from
importing satellite receivers into Canada and from activating satellite
receivers located in Canada to receive programming, together with damages in
excess of $175 million.

The Court in the Alberta action denied EchoStar’s Motion to Dismiss, and
EchoStar’s appeal of that decision. The Federal action has been stayed pending
the outcome of the Alberta action. EchoStar intends to continue to vigorously
defend the suit. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the receipt
in Canada of programming from United States pay television providers is
prohibited. While EchoStar was not a party to that case, the ruling could
aversely affect EchoStar’s defense. It is too early to make an assessment of
the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, EchoStar obtained feeds of distant broadcast network
channels (ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX) for distribution to its customers through
PrimeTime 24, an independent third party programming provider. In December
1998, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
entered a nationwide permanent injunction requiring that provider to shut off
distant network channels to many of its customers, and henceforth to sell those
channels to consumers in accordance with certain stipulations in the
injunction.

In October 1998, EchoStar filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC,
NBC, CBS and FOX in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado. EchoStar asked the Court to enter judgment declaring that its method
of providing distant network programming did not violate the Satellite Home
Viewer Act and hence did not infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November
1998, the networks and their affiliate groups filed a complaint against
EchoStar in Miami Federal Court alleging, among other things, copyright
infringement. The Court combined the case that EchoStar filed in Colorado with
the case in Miami and transferred it to the Miami Federal Court. The case
remains pending in Florida. While the networks have not sought monetary
damages, they have sought to recover attorney fees if they prevail.

In February 1999, the networks filed a “Motion for Temporary Restraining
Order, Preliminary Injunction and Contempt Finding” against DirecTV, Inc. in
Miami related to the delivery of distant network channels to DirecTV

F-35


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

customers
by satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the networks. Under the terms
of the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV customers were
scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels
by July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by
December 31, 1999. Subsequently, substantially all providers of
satellite-delivered network programming other than EchoStar agreed to this
cut-off schedule, although EchoStar does not know if they adhered to this
schedule.

In December 1998, the networks filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction
against Echostar in the Florida case and asked the Court to enjoin EchoStar
from providing network programming except under limited circumstances. A
preliminary injunction hearing was held in September 1999. In March 2000, the
networks filed an emergency motion again asking the Court to issue an
injunction requiring EchoStar to cease providing network programming to certain
of its customers. At that time, the networks also argued that EchoStar’s
compliance procedures violated the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which
was passed by Congress in November 1999. EchoStar opposed the networks’ motion
and again asked the Court to hear live testimony before ruling upon the
networks’ injunction request.

During September 2000, the Court granted the networks’ motion for
preliminary injunction, denied the networks’ emergency motion, and denied
EchoStar’s request to present live testimony and evidence. The Court’s
original order required EchoStar to terminate network programming to certain
subscribers “no later than February 15, 1999,” and contained other dates with
which it would be physically impossible to comply. The order imposed
restrictions on EchoStar’s past and future sale of distant ABC, NBC, CBS and
FOX channels similar to those imposed on PrimeTime 24 (and, EchoStar believes,
on DirecTV and others). Some of those restrictions go beyond the statutory
requirements imposed by the Satellite Home Viewer Act and the Satellite Home
Viewer Improvement Act.

Twice during October 2000, the Court amended its original preliminary
injunction order in an effort to fix some of the errors in the original order.
The twice-amended preliminary injunction order required EchoStar to shut off,
by February 15, 2001, all subscribers who were ineligible to receive distant
network programming under the Court’s order. EchoStar appealed the preliminary
injunction orders. During September 2001, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court’s nationwide preliminary
injunction, which the Eleventh Circuit had stayed in November 2000. The
Eleventh Circuit also rejected EchoStar’s First Amendment challenge to the
Satellite Home Viewer Act. However, the Eleventh Circuit found that the
District Court had made factual findings that were clearly erroneous and not
supported by the evidence, and that the District Court had misinterpreted and
misapplied the law. The Eleventh Circuit issued an order during January 2002
remanding the case to the Florida District Court. During March 2002, the
Florida District Court entered an order setting the trial in the matter for
January 13, 2003 and setting a discovery and pretrial schedule. In this order,
the District Court denied certain of EchoStar’s outstanding motions to compel
discovery as moot and granted the networks’ motion to compel. The trial date
has now been moved to April 7, 2003. During April 2002, the District Court
denied the networks’ motion for preliminary injunction as moot. In June 2002,
EchoStar filed a counterclaim against the networks asking the District Court to
find that EchoStar is not violating the Satellite Home Viewer Act and seeking
damages resulting from the networks’ tortious interference with EchoStar’s
business relationships and from the networks’ conduct amounting to unfair
competition. The networks filed a motion to dismiss these claims. In August
2002, the District Court denied the networks’ motion to dismiss. In September
2002, the networks answered our counterclaim.

In April 2002, EchoStar reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one
of the plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of
dismissal. On April 16, 2002, the District Court entered an order dismissing
the claims between ABC, Inc. and EchoStar. In November 2002, EchoStar reached
a private settlement with NBC, another of the plaintiffs in the litigation and
jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. On November 25, 2002, the District
court entered an order dismissing the claims between NBC and EchoStar. Six of
the original eight plaintiffs remain, including CBS and Fox, along with the
associations affiliated with each of the four networks. On January 28, 2003,
the parties participated in a court ordered mediation. The mediation did not
resolve the parties’ disputes. However, the parties agreed to continue the
mediation and participate in another mediation session.

If the District Court enters an injunction against EchoStar, the
injunction could force EchoStar to terminate delivery of distant network
channels to a substantial portion of its distant network subscriber base, which
could also

F-36


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

cause many of these subscribers to cancel their subscription to
EchoStar’s other programming services. Any such terminations would result in a
small reduction in EchoStar’s reported average monthly revenue per subscriber
and could result in a temporary increase in churn. If EchoStar loses the case
at trial, the judge could, as one of many possible remedies, prohibit all
future sales of distant network programming by EchoStar, which would have a
material adverse affect on its business.

Gemstar

During October 2000, Starsight Telecast, Inc., a subsidiary of Gemstar-TV
Guide International, Inc. (“Gemstar”), filed a suit for patent infringement
against EchoStar and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States District
Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent No. 4,706,121 (“the `121 Patent”)
which relates to certain electronic program guide functions. EchoStar has
examined this patent and believes that it is not infringed by any of its
products or services. This conclusion is supported by findings of the
International Trade Commission (“ITC”) which are discussed below. Gemstar has
moved to stay the North Carolina action pending appeal of the ITC decision.
EchoStar has opposed Gemstar’s motion.

In December 2000, EchoStar filed suit against Gemstar-TV Guide (and
certain of its subsidiaries) in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado alleging violations by Gemstar of various federal and
state anti-trust laws and laws governing unfair competition. The lawsuit seeks
an injunction and monetary damages. Gemstar filed counterclaims alleging
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,923,362 and 5,684,525 that relate
to certain electronic program guide functions. EchoStar examined these patents
and believe they are not infringed by any of its products or services. In
August 2001, the Federal Multi-District Litigation panel combined this suit,
for pre-trial purposes, with other lawsuits asserting antitrust claims against
Gemstar, which had previously been filed by other parties. In January 2002,
Gemstar dropped the counterclaims of patent infringement. During March 2002,
the Court denied Gemstar’s Motion to Dismiss EchoStar’s antitrust claims. A
more recently filed motion for summary judgment based generally on lack of
standing has also been denied. In its answer, Gemstar asserted new patent
infringement counterclaims regarding United States Patent Nos. 4,908,713 and
5,915,068 (which is expired). These patents relate to onscreen programming of
VCRs. EchoStar has examined these patents and believes that they are not
infringed by any of its products or services.

In February 2001, Gemstar filed patent infringement actions against
EchoStar in the District Court in Atlanta, Georgia and with the ITC. These
suits allege infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,252,066, 5,479,268 and
5,809,204, all of which relate to certain electronic program guide functions.
In addition, the ITC action alleges infringement of the `121 Patent which is
asserted in the North Carolina case previously discussed. In the Georgia
district court case, Gemstar seeks damages and an injunction. The Georgia case
was stayed pending resolution of the ITC action and remains stayed at this
time. In December 2001, the ITC held a 15-day hearing before an administrative
law judge. Prior to the hearing, Gemstar dropped its allegations regarding
United States Patent No. 5,252,066 with respect to which EchoStar had asserted
substantial allegations of inequitable conduct. The hearing addressed, among
other things, Gemstar’s allegations of patent infringement and respondents’
(SCI, Scientific Atlanta, Pioneer and EchoStar) allegations of patent misuse.
During June 2002, the judge issued a Final Initial Determination finding that
none of the patents asserted by Gemstar had been infringed. In addition, the
judge found that Gemstar was guilty of patent misuse with respect to the `121
Patent and that the `121 Patent was unenforceable because it failed to name an
inventor. The parties then filed petitions for the full ITC to review the
judge’s Final Initial Determination. During August 2002, the full ITC adopted
the Judge’s findings regarding non-infringement and the unenforceability of the
`121 Patent. The ITC did not adopt, but did not overturn, the Judge’s findings
of patent misuse. Gemstar is appealing the decision of the ITC to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. If the Federal Circuit were
to overturn the Judge’s decision, such an adverse decision in this case could
temporarily halt the import of EchoStar receivers and could require EchoStar to
materially modify certain user-friendly electronic programming guides and
related features it currently offer to consumers. Based upon EchoStar’s review
of these patents, and based upon the ITC’s decision, EchoStar continues to
believe that these patents are not infringed by any of its products or
services. EchoStar intends to continue to vigorously contest the ITC, North
Carolina and Georgia suits and will, among other things, continue to challenge
both the validity and enforceability of the asserted patents.

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) also filed suit against
EchoStar, DirecTV and others in the United States District Court for the
Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division, alleging infringement
of United States Patent Nos. 5,038,211, 5,293,357 and 4,751,578 which relate to
certain electronic program guide functions, including the use of electronic
program guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and declaratory
relief and damages in an unspecified amount. It is EchoStar’s understanding
that these patents may be licensed by Superguide to Gemstar. Gemstar was added
as a party to this case and asserted these patents against EchoStar. EchoStar
has examined these patents and believes that they are not infringed by any of
its products or services. A Markman ruling interpreting the patent claims was
issued by the Court and in response to that ruling EchoStar filed motions for
summary judgment of non-infringement for each of the asserted patents. Gemstar
filed a motion for summary judgment of infringement with respect to one of the
patents. During July 2002, the Court issued a Memorandum of Opinion on the summary judgment motions. In its Opinion,
the Court ruled that none of EchoStar’s products infringe the 5,038,211 and
5,293,357 patents. With respect to the 4,751,578 patent, the Court ruled that
none of EchoStar’s current products infringed that patent and asked for
additional information before it could rule on certain low-volume products that
are no longer in production. During July 2002, the Court summarily ruled that
the aforementioned low-volume products did not infringe any of the asserted
patents. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case and awarded EchoStar its
court costs. Superguide and Gemstar are appealing this case to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. EchoStar will continue to
vigorously defend this case. In the event the Federal Circuit ultimately
determines that EchoStar infringes on any of the aforementioned patents,
EchoStar may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble
damages and/or an injunction that could require EchoStar to materially modify
certain user-friendly electronic programming guide and related features that
EchoStar currently offers to consumers. It is too early to make an assessment
of the probable outcome of the suits.

California Actions

A purported class action was filed against EchoStar in the California
State Superior Court for Alameda County during May 2001 by Andrew A. Werby.
The complaint, relating to late fees, alleges unlawful, unfair and fraudulent
business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code
Section 17200 et seq., false and misleading advertising in violation of
California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, and violation of the
California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. During September 2001, EchoStar filed
an answer denying all material allegations of the complaint, and the Court
entered an Order Pursuant to Stipulation for a provisional certification of the
class, for an orderly exchange of information and for mediation. The
provisional Order specifies that the class will be de-certified upon notice if
mediation does not resolve the dispute. A settlement has been reached with
plaintiff’s counsel and the Court issued its preliminary approval of the
settlement on October 18, 2002. The Court has set a March 7, 2003 date for
hearing on final approval after notice to the class. If the settlement is not
approved, EchoStar intends to deny all liability and to vigorously defend the
lawsuit. The settlement confirms that the late fee charged by EchoStar is
appropriate and will not change.

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal
clear digital video,” “CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and
with respect to the number of channels available in various programming
packages was also filed against EchoStar in the California State Superior Court
for Los Angeles County in 1999 by David Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a
nonprofit unincorporated association. The complaint alleges breach of express
warranty and violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil
Code Sections 1750, et seq., and the California Business & Professions Code
Sections 17500 & 17200. A hearing on the plaintiffs’ Motion for Class
Certification and EchoStar’s Motion for Summary Judgment was held during June
2002. At the hearing, the Court issued a preliminary ruling denying the
plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. However, before issuing a final
ruling on Class Certification, the Court granted EchoStar’s Motion for Summary
Judgment with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ claims. Subsequently, EchoStar
filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees which was denied by the Court. The
Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court’s Granting of EchoStar’s
Motion for Summary Judgment and EchoStar Cross-Appealed the Court’s ruling on
EchoStar’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees. It is not possible to make a firm
assessment of the probable outcome of the appeal or to determine the extent of
any potential liability or damages.

State Investigation

During April 2002, two state attorneys general commenced a civil
investigation concerning certain of EchoStar’s business practices. Over the
course of the next six months, 11 additional states ultimately joined the
investigation. The states allege failure to comply with consumer protection
laws based on EchoStar’s call response times and policies, advertising and
customer agreement disclosures, policies for handling consumer complaints,
issuing rebates and refunds and charging cancellation fees to consumers, and
other matters. EchoStar has cooperated fully in the investigation and is
currently in settlement discussions with the states. It is not possible to
determine the extent of any damages or injunctive relief which could result in
the event a settlement is not reached.

Retailer Class Actions

EchoStar has been sued by retailers in three separate purported class
actions. During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed in the Arapahoe
County District Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District
Court for the District of Colorado, respectively, by Air Communication &
Satellite, Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of themselves and a class of
persons similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify
nationwide classes on behalf of certain of EchoStar’s satellite hardware
retailers. The plaintiffs are requesting the Courts to declare certain
provisions of, and changes to, alleged agreements between EchoStar and the
retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives
and payments, charge backs, and other compensation. EchoStar intends to
vigorously defend against the suits and to assert a variety of counterclaims.
The United States District Court for the District of Colorado stayed the
Federal Court action to allow the parties to pursue a comprehensive
adjudication of their dispute in the Arapahoe County State Court. John DeJong,
d/b/a Nexwave, and Joseph Kelley, d/b/a Keltronics, subsequently intervened in
the Arapahoe County Court action as plaintiffs and proposed class
representatives. EchoStar has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all counts
and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Additional
Time to Conduct Discovery to enable them to respond to EchoStar’s motion. The
Court has not ruled on either of the two motions. It is too early to make an
assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent
of any potential liability or damages.

Satellite Dealers Supply, Inc. (“SDS”) filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas during September 2000,
on behalf of itself and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiff
was attempting to certify a nationwide class on behalf of sellers, installers,
and servicers of satellite equipment who contract with EchoStar and who allege
that EchoStar: (1) charged back certain fees paid by members of the class to
professional installers in violation of contractual terms; (2) manipulated the
accounts of subscribers to deny payments to class members; and (3)
misrepresented, to class members, who owns certain equipment related to the
provision of satellite television service. During September 2001, the Court
granted EchoStar’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction. The
plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the Court’s order dismissing the case.
The Court denied the Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration. The trial court
denied EchoStar’s Motions for Sanctions against SDS. Both parties have now
perfected appeals before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is not possible
to make a firm assessment of the probable outcome of the appeal or to determine
the extent of any potential liability or damages.

PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture

PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture (“PrimeTime 24”) filed suit against EchoStar
during September 1998 seeking damages in excess of $10 million and alleging
breach of contract, wrongful termination of contract, interference with
contractual relations, trademark infringement and unfair competition. EchoStar
denied all of PrimeTime 24’s allegations and asserted various counterclaims.
EchoStar has reached a settlement agreement with PrimeTime 24 pursuant to which
the parties agreed to release all parties from any liability and dismiss the
case with prejudice. The settlement amount was not material.

StarBand Shareholder Lawsuit

On August 20, 2002, a shareholder in StarBand filed an action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation, together
with four EchoStar executives who sat on the Board of Directors for StarBand,
for alleged breach of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith and loyalty,
and also against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation for aiding and abetting such
alleged breaches. Two of the individual defendants, Charles W. Ergen and David
K. Moskowitz, are members of the Board of Directors of EchoStar. The action
stems from the defendants’ involvement as directors, and EchoBand’s position as
a shareholder, in StarBand, a broadband Internet satellite venture that is
currently in bankruptcy. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to
ensure StarBand’s failure in order to guarantee that EchoStar’s then-pending
merger with Hughes would be successful. Plaintiffs seek an accounting of
damages for their $25 million investment in StarBand in addition to costs and
disbursements. Defendants deny the allegations in the complaint and intend to
defend the litigation vigorously. During October 2002, EchoStar, along with
the other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety
based on lack of personal jurisdiction. These motions have been briefed and
oral argument has been set by the Court for March 18, 2003. It is too early to
make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine
the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Merger Related Proceedings

On October 24, 2002, a purported shareholder filed a Shareholder’s
Derivative Action against EchoStar and the current members of its Board of
Directors and named EchoStar as a nominal defendant. The Plaintiff filed the
action in the United States District Court of Clark County, Nevada. The
complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and other
unlawful acts relating to EchoStar’s agreement to (1) pay Hughes Electronics
Corporation a $600 million termination fee in certain circumstances and (2)
acquire Hughes’ shareholder interest in PanAmSat at a premium rate. The
agreements to pay the termination fee and acquire PanAmSat were required in the
event that the merger with DirecTV was not completed by January 21, 2003. No
answer is due from the defendants, and all parties have entered into a
stipulation allowing the defendants to answer only subject to 30-day notice
from the plaintiff. EchoStar and the individual defendants intend to deny all
liability and to defend this action vigorously. It is too early to make an
assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent
of any potential liability or damages.

EchoStar is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims which
arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of those actions will not
materially affect EchoStar’s financial position or results of operations.

Meteoroid Events

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in orbit geosynchronous
satellites including EchoStar’s DBS satellites. While the probability that
EchoStar’s satellites will be damaged by meteoroids is very small, that
probability increases significantly when the Earth passes through the
particulate stream left behind by various comets.

Occasionally, increased solar activity poses a potential threat to all
in-orbit geosynchronous satellites including EchoStar’s DBS satellites. The
probability that the effects from this activity will damage our satellites or
cause service interruptions is generally very small.

Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass
through the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to
operational spacecraft including EchoStar’s DBS satellites. The locations of
these hazards are generally well known and may require EchoStar to perform
maneuvers to avoid collisions.

both United States and International customers. Europe revenue includes
transactions with customers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. During the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, United States revenue included export
sales to two international customers which totaled $187 million and $176
million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2002, United States
revenue included export sales to one international customer which totaled $169
million. These international sales accounted for approximately 7%, 4% and 3.5%
of EchoStar’s total revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2000,
2001 and 2002, respectively. Revenues from these customers are included within
the EchoStar Technologies Corporation operating segment.

11. Summary Financial Information of Equity Method Investee

EchoStar originally invested $50 million in StarBand Communications Inc.
in April 2000. Effective September 27, 2001, EchoStar invested an additional
$50 million in StarBand, increasing its equity interest from approximately 19%
to approximately 32%. As a result of the increased equity stake, this
investment was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As
required by APB Opinion No. 18, the equity method accounting was retroactively
applied back to April 2000, the date of EchoStar’s original investment in
StarBand. During the first quarter of 2002, EchoStar reduced the carrying
value of its StarBand investment to zero. StarBand subsequently filed for
bankruptcy during June 2002. As such, StarBand is no longer considered a
significant subsidiary.

Summarized financial information for StarBand has been derived from
StarBand’s audited financial statements as of December 31, 2001 for Balance
Sheet data and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 for the Statement
of Operations data, which were audited by other auditors (whose reports

concern) and is as follows (in thousands):
