PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Our Business

EchoStar Communications Corporation, through its DISH Network, is a leading provider of satellite
delivered digital television to customers across the United States. DISH Network services include
hundreds of video, audio and data channels, interactive television channels, digital video
recording, high definition television, international programming, professional installation and
24-hour customer service.

We started offering subscription television services on the DISH Network in March 1996. As of
December 31, 2005, the DISH Network had approximately 12.040 million subscribers. We currently
have 14 owned or leased in-orbit satellites which enable us to offer over 2,300 video and audio
channels to consumers across the United States. Since we use many of these channels for local
programming, no particular consumer could subscribe to all channels, but all are available using
small consumer satellite antennae, or dishes. We believe that the DISH Network offers programming
packages that have a better “price-to-value” relationship than packages currently offered by most
other subscription television providers. As of December 31, 2005, there were over 27.0 million
subscribers to direct broadcast satellite services in the United States. We believe that there are
more than 94.2 million pay television subscribers in the United States, and there continues to be
unsatisfied demand for high quality, reasonably priced television programming services.

DISH Network and EchoStar Technologies Corporation

EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC”) is a holding company. Its subsidiaries (which together
with ECC are referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) operate two
interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k — which provides a direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription
television service in the United States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”) — which designs and develops DBS set-top
boxes, antennae and other digital equipment for the DISH Network. We refer to this
equipment collectively as “EchoStar receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and
distributes similar equipment for international satellite service providers.

We have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS System.” The EchoStar DBS
System consists of our FCC allocated DBS spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, EchoStar
receiver systems, digital broadcast operations centers, customer service facilities, and certain
other assets utilized in our operations. Our principal business strategy is to continue developing
our subscription television service in the United States to provide consumers with a competitive
alternative to cable television service.

Other Information

We were organized in 1995 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our common stock
is publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol “DISH.” Our principal executive
offices are located at 9601 South Meridian Boulevard, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and our telephone
number is (303) 723-1000.

Recent Developments

EchoStar X.

EchoStar X, a DBS satellite which can operate up to 49 spot beams using up
to 42 active 140 watt TWTAs, was launched on February 15, 2006. Assuming successful completion of
in-orbit testing, the satellite is expected to commence commercial operations during the second
quarter of 2006 at the 110 degree orbital location. The spot beams on EchoStar X are designed to
increase the number of markets where we can offer local channels by satellite, including high
definition local channels.



$1.5 Billion Senior Notes Offering.

On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion aggregate principal
amount of our ten-year, 7 1/8% Senior Notes due February 1, 2016 in a private placement. The
proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to redeem our outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due
2009 and are also intended to be used for other general corporate purposes.

9 1/8% Senior Notes Redemption.

Effective February 17, 2006, we redeemed the balance of our
outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing
the notes, the remaining principal amount of the notes of approximately $442.0 million was redeemed
at 104.563% of the principal amount, for a total of approximately $462.1 million. The premium paid
of approximately $20.1 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $2.8
million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2006.

DISH NETWORK

Programming

Basic Programming Packages

.

We use a “value-based” strategy in structuring the content and pricing
of programming packages available from the DISH Network. For example, we currently sell our
“America’s Top 60” package for $29.99 per month. This package includes 60 of our most popular
video channels in digital format. We estimate that cable operators would typically charge over
$40.00 per month, on average, for comparable expanded basic service.

Our “America’s Top 120” package currently sells for $39.99 per month and is similar to an expanded
basic cable package plus more than 30 commercial-free, CD-quality music channels. We estimate that
cable operators would typically charge over $50.00 per month, on average, for a similar package.

Our “America’s Top 180” currently sells for $49.99 per month, and our “America’s Everything Pak,”
which combines our “America’s Top 180” package and more than 30 commercial-free premium movie
channels including HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and Starz, currently sells for $84.99 per month.

We also offer satellite-delivered local broadcast channels for an additional $5.99 per month in 164
markets in the United States, representing over 95% of all of U.S. television households. Cable
operators typically include local channels in their programming packages at no additional cost. In
addition, generally, subscribers to any of our basic packages may add a digital video recorder to
their system for an additional cost of only $5.98 per month.

High Definition Programming Packages.

We offer high definition (“HD”) programming in our DishHD
Bronze ($49.99), DishHD Silver ($59.99), DishHD Gold ($69.99) and DishHD Platinum ($99.99) packages
which include from 60 to 180 of our most popular video channels in digital format and 23 channels
in HD. The 23 HD channel package may be purchased for $29.99. In addition, HBO and Showtime are
offered in HD for those customers who subscribe to these channels. We also currently offer
satellite delivered HD local channels in 13 markets and expect to reach more than 50 percent of
U.S. households with local HD channels by the end of 2006.

Family-Friendly Programming Package.

We recently added a new programming tier, DishFAMILY, which
offers 40 “family- friendly” channels including sports, news, children’s programming, lifestyle,
hobbies, shopping and public interest, for $19.99 per month, or $24.99 including local channels
where available. Comparatively, the family tier prices announced by most pay TV providers are more
than $30 per month, and often more than $35 per month.

DISH Latino Programming Packages

.

We also offer a variety of Spanish-language programming
packages. Our “DISH Latino” package includes more than 35 Spanish-language programming channels
for $24.99 per month. We also offer “DISH Latino Dos,” which includes over 150 English and
Spanish-language programming channels for $34.99 per month. Our “DISH Latino Max” includes more
than 175 Spanish and English-language channels for $44.99 per month.



Prepaid Programming Card.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we began test marketing a prepay
program, “DISH Now.” This program allows consumers who might not be attracted by our existing
promotions to purchase a satellite receiver system and a prepaid card which can be refreshed
periodically through additional prepayments. We have not yet determined whether this program will
be offered broadly. Certain of our business metrics could be impacted to the extent we ultimately
acquire a significant number of subscribers through “DISH Now.” For example, while “DISH Now” may
attract subscribers more likely to churn than our traditional customers, our subscriber acquisition
costs under this program will also be substantially lower.

Movie Packages

.

We offer five premium movie packages starting at $11.99 per month and including as
many as 10 channels. We believe our movie packages are a better value than similar packages
offered by most other multi-channel video providers.

International Programming

.

We offer over 115 foreign-language channels including Arabic, South
Asian, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Greek and many others. DISH Network remains the pay-TV leader in
delivering foreign-language programming to customers in the United States, and our foreign-language
programming contributes significantly to our subscriber growth. We believe foreign-language
programming is a valuable niche product that attracts new subscribers to DISH Network who are
unable to get similar programming elsewhere, and we will continue to explore opportunities to add
foreign language programming.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Sales Channels.

We currently distribute EchoStar receiver systems and solicit orders for
DISH Network programming services through direct marketers, independent retailers, consumer
electronics stores, independent distributors and telecommunication providers. We also offer
receiver systems and programming through our own direct sales channels. Independent retailers are
primarily local retailers who specialize in TV and home entertainment systems. We also acquire
customers through nationwide retailers such as Costco, Sears and certain regional consumer
electronic chains. In addition, RadioShack Corporation offers EchoStar receiver systems and
markets DISH Network programming services through approximately 5,200 corporate stores, in
approximately 1,000 dealer franchise stores nationwide and in over 500 kiosks located throughout
the United States primarily in Sam’s Clubs.

We generally pay distributors, direct marketers and other retailers a fee upon activation of each
new subscriber they acquire for us. We also typically make a small monthly payment for as long as
the customer continues to subscribe to our programming.

Marketing

.

We use print, radio and television, on a local and national basis, to
advertise and promote the DISH Network. We also offer point-of-sale literature, product displays,
demonstration kiosks and signage for retail outlets. We provide guides that describe DISH Network
products and services to our retailers and distributors and conduct periodic educational seminars.
Our mobile sales and marketing team visits retail outlets regularly to reinforce training and
ensure that these outlets have proper point-of-sale materials for our current promotions.
Additionally, we dedicate a DISH Network television channel and websites to provide retailers and
customers with information about special services and promotions that we offer from time to time.

Promotional Subsidies

.

Our future success in the subscription television industry depends on,
among other factors, our ability to acquire and retain DISH Network subscribers. We provide
varying levels of subsidies and incentives to attract customers, including leased, free or
subsidized receiver systems, installations, programming and other items. This marketing strategy
emphasizes our long-term business strategy of maximizing future revenue by selling DISH Network
programming to a large potential subscriber base and rapidly increasing our subscriber base. Since
we subsidize consumer up-front costs, we incur significant costs each time we acquire a new
subscriber. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that, on average, we will be able to
fully recoup the up-front costs of subscriber acquisition from future subscription television
services revenue.



During July 2000, we began offering our DISH Network subscribers the option to lease receiver
systems. Our current equipment lease program, the DHA promotion, offers new customers the ability
to lease receivers serving up to four rooms, including various premium models such as advanced digital video recorders and HD
receivers, when they subscribe to one of several qualifying programming packages. Although there
can be no assurance, we expect this marketing strategy will reduce the cost of acquiring future
subscribers because we retain ownership of the receiver systems. Upon termination of service, DHA
subscribers are required to return the receiver and certain other equipment to us. While we do not
recover all of the equipment upon termination of service, equipment that is recovered after
deactivation is reconditioned and re-deployed at a lower cost than new equipment. The
effectiveness of our plan to reduce subscriber acquisition costs through redeployment of leased
equipment is dependent on our ability to retrieve and cost-effectively recondition leased equipment
from subscribers who terminate service. Our ability to realize reduced equipment costs from
redeploying reconditioned equipment will be negatively impacted by new compression and other
technologies that will inevitably render some portion of our current and future EchoStar receivers
obsolete. We will incur additional costs, which may be substantial, to upgrade or replace these
set-top boxes.

We base our marketing promotions, among other things, on current competitive conditions. In some
cases, if competition increases, or we determine for any other reason that it is necessary to
increase our subscriber acquisition costs to attract new customers, our profitability and costs of
operation would be adversely affected.

Digital Video Recording and Interactive Service

We continue to expand our offerings to include advanced products such as digital video recorders,
or “DVRs” and interactive programming services. DISH Network customers can purchase or lease
receivers with built-in hard disk drives that permit viewers to pause and record live programs,
including programming in HD, without the need for videotape. We now offer receivers capable of
storing more than 210 hours of standard definition programming and expect to increase storage
capacity on future receiver models. We also currently offer receivers that provide a wide variety
of innovative interactive television services and applications, including shopping and weather
channels and interactive games.

Bundling Alliances

We have agreements to allow our partners, such as AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”), formerly known as SBC
Communications, Inc., to offer a bundled package of services combining DISH Network satellite
television with voice and data services.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, AT&T commenced sales of a co-branded service featuring our
DISH Network service bundled together with AT&T’s telephony, high-speed data and other
communications services. AT&T markets the bundled service and is responsible for certain
integrated order-entry, customer service and billing. Initially, AT&T also purchased set-top box
equipment from us to lease to bundled service customers. AT&T out-sourced installation and certain
customer service functions to us for a fee. As part of the agreement, AT&T paid us certain
development and implementation fees during 2003 and 2004.

During the first half of 2005, AT&T shifted its DISH Network marketing and sales efforts to focus
on limited geographic areas and customer segments. As a result of AT&T’s de-emphasized sales of
DISH Network services, a decreasing percentage of our new subscriber additions were derived from
our relationship with AT&T. During fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution
and sales agency agreement with AT&T. We believe our overall economic return will be similar under
both arrangements.

While we expect to continue to pursue opportunities to bundle our DISH Network satellite television
service with the voice and data services of AT&T and other telecommunications providers, AT&T has
begun deployment of fiber-optic networks that will allow it to offer video services directly to
millions of homes as early as the second half of 2006. Other telecommunications companies have
announced similar plans. While it is possible that the fourth quarter 2005 revision to our AT&T
agreement may drive increased subscriber growth, our net new subscriber additions and certain of
our other key operating metrics could continue to be adversely affected to the extent AT&T further
de-emphasizes, or discontinues altogether, its efforts to acquire DISH Network subscribers, and as
a result of competition from video services offered by AT&T or other telecommunications companies.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing significant new
bundling opportunities with other telecommunications companies.



Our Satellites

Our satellites operate in the “Ku” and “Ka” band portions of the microwave radio spectrum used for
satellite communications. The FCC has split the Ku-band spectrum into two segments. The 11.7 to
12.2 GHz downlink band, which is the low and medium power portion of the Ku-band, is known as the
Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) band. The high power portion of the Ku-band within the 12.2 to
12.7 GHz downlink band is known as the Broadcast Satellite Service (“BSS”) band, which is also
referred to as Direct Broadcast Satellite or the “DBS” band.

Unlike the DBS spectrum, the FSS spectrum has no predefined frequency plan such that the number and
bandwidth of each individual channel can vary and satellite orbital locations are routinely as
close together as two degrees. In addition, there are more severe power limitations placed on FSS
spectrum. The result of these differences generally means that, while FSS spectrum can be
satisfactorily used for delivery of direct-to-home (“DTH”) services, it can carry somewhat less
capacity and generally requires a slightly larger user antenna or consumer dish to adequately
receive signals from a satellite.

Ka-band is a higher frequency band than Ku-band and roughly ranges from 18 to 40 GHz. For
commercial users, the downlink spectrum is generally considered to consist of frequencies between
18.3 — 18.8 GHz and 19.7 — 20.2 GHz. This part of the Ka-band is also considered to be FSS
spectrum, and therefore Ka-band orbital locations can routinely be as close together as two
degrees. The higher frequency and closer spacing generally make Ka-band spectrum transmissions
more susceptible to various types of signal interference, including interference caused by rain and
snow. While several companies in the satellite communications industry have business plans for the
use of Ka-band spectrum for video, data and broadband services, the use of Ka-band spectrum for
commercial satellite communication services is still in the developmental stage.

Most of our programming is currently transmitted to our customers on DBS frequencies within the
Ku-band spectrum. However, we continue to explore other opportunities including partnerships and
investments to expand our capacity through the use of other available spectrum, such as FSS
services in the Ku and Ka-bands.

Overview of Our Satellites and FCC Authorizations

.

Our satellites are located in orbital
positions, or slots, that are designated by their western longitude. An orbital position describes
both a physical location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band. The FCC
has divided each DBS orbital position into 32 frequency channels. Each transponder on our
satellites typically exploits one frequency channel. Through digital compression technology, we
can currently transmit between nine and 13 digital video channels from each transponder. Several
of our satellites also include spot-beam technology which enables us to increase the number of
markets where we provide local channels, but reduces the number of video channels that could
otherwise be offered across the entire United States.

The FCC has licensed us to operate 104 direct broadcast satellite frequencies at various
orbital positions including:

•

21 frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location and 29 frequencies at the 110
degree orbital location, both capable of providing service to the entire
continental United States (“CONUS”);

•

22 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location, capable of providing service
to the Eastern and Central United States;

•

32 frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location, capable of providing service
to the Western United States.

In addition, we currently have the right to use 32 frequencies at a Canadian DBS slot at the 129
degree orbital location, capable of providing service to most of CONUS. A new 32 transponder
Canadian satellite, Ciel 2, is being constructed for operation at that location. We will have the
right to at least 50% of the capacity of that satellite, with the remaining 50% required by
Canadian regulations to be offered for use by Canadians until the time of launch of the satellite.
Consequently, until Ciel 2 is launched, we will not know the exact amount of capacity available to
us on that satellite.



We also hold licenses or have entered into agreements to lease capacity on satellites at three FSS
orbital locations including:

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 32 frequencies at the 121 degree orbital
location, capable of providing CONUS service, plus 500 MHz of Ka spectrum at the
121 degree orbital location capable of providing service into select spot
beams;

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 24 frequencies at the 105 degree
orbital location, currently capable of providing service to CONUS, Alaska and
Hawaii, plus approximately 720 MHz of Ka spectrum capable of providing service
through spot beams to CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii; and

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 24 frequencies at the 85 degree orbital
location, currently capable of providing service to CONUS, plus approximately 720
MHz of Ka spectrum capable of providing service through spot beams to CONUS.

In addition, we were the winning bidder for the remaining 29 DBS frequencies at the 157 degree
orbital location at an FCC auction conducted in July 2004. However, the Washington, D.C. Court of
Appeals overturned the auction and the FCC has not yet decided how it will allocate those orbital
slots and frequencies. We have also applied for the two remaining frequencies at the 61.5 slot.
We cannot be certain that the FCC will ultimately grant us the licenses for the additional
frequencies at the 61.5 or 157 degree orbital locations.

We currently broadcast the majority of our programming from the 110 and 119 degree orbital
locations. Almost all of our customers have satellite receiver systems that are equipped to
receive signals from both of these locations.

Satellite Fleet

We presently have 14 owned or leased satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles
above the equator. Each of the satellites we own had an original minimum design life of at least
12 years. Our satellite fleet is a major component of our EchoStar DBS System. While we believe
that overall our satellite fleet is generally in good condition, during 2005 and prior periods,
certain satellites within our fleet have experienced various anomalies, some of which have had a
significant adverse impact on their commercial operation.

Owned Satellites

We currently own 11 in-orbit satellites.

EchoStar I and II.

EchoStar I and II currently operate at the 148 degree orbital location. Each
of these Series 7000 class satellites, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation
(“Lockheed”), has 16 transponders that operate at approximately 130 watts of power. While both
satellites are currently functioning properly in orbit, similar Lockheed Series 7000 class
satellites owned by third parties have experienced total in-orbit failure. While no telemetry or
other data indicates EchoStar I or EchoStar II would be expected to experience a similar failure,
Lockheed has been unable to conclude these and other Series 7000 satellites will not experience
similar failures. EchoStar I and II are each equipped with 24 Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers
(“TWTA”), of which 16 are required to support full operation on each satellite. Prior to 2005,
anomalies left each satellite with 23 usable TWTAs. While we do not expect a large number of
additional TWTAs to fail in any year, it is likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from
time to time in the future, and that those failures may impact commercial operation of the
satellites. The TWTA failures have not reduced the remaining estimated useful life of the
satellite.

EchoStar III.

Our EchoStar III satellite operates at the 61.5 degree orbital location. While
originally designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel,
switchable to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per channel, the satellite was equipped
with a total of 44 TWTAs to provide redundancy. As of January 8, 2006, this satellite has
experienced 11 transponder pair (22 TWTA) failures. As a result, EchoStar III can now operate a
maximum of 22 transponders, but due to redundancy switching limitations and specific channel
authorizations, it currently can only operate 17 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies we utilize at
the 61.5 degree west orbital location for this spacecraft. While we don’t expect a large number of
additional TWTAs to fail in any year, it is likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from
time to time in the future, and that those failures will further impact commercial operation of the satellite. The TWTA failures have not
reduced the remaining estimated useful life of the satellite.



EchoStar IV.

Our EchoStar IV satellite was originally designed to operate a maximum of 32
transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at
over 230 watts per channel. During July 2005, we relocated our EchoStar IV satellite from our 157
degree orbital location to a third party Mexican DBS orbital slot located at 77 degrees. During
the relocation, EchoStar IV experienced a thruster anomaly which has not impacted commercial
operation of the satellite. Prior to 2004, this satellite experienced failures with the deployment
of its solar arrays and with 38 of its 44 transponders (including spares), and further experienced
anomalies affecting its thermal systems and propulsion systems. Several years ago, we filed an
insurance claim for a total loss under the launch insurance policies covering this satellite.
During March 2005, we settled this insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad
faith with the insurers for a net amount of $240.0 million (see Note 3 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). During September
2004, the south solar array on EchoStar IV deployed fully and appears to be producing nominal
current. There can be no assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use, of
EchoStar IV will not occur in the immediate future. As discussed above, EchoStar IV is only
capable of operating six of its 44 transponders and is fully depreciated.

EchoStar V.

EchoStar V, which is currently located at the 129 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 110 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at over 220 watts per channel. Momentum wheel failures on this
satellite in prior years resulted in increased fuel consumption and caused a minor reduction of
spacecraft life. During 2005, we determined those anomalies will reduce the life of EchoStar V
more than previously estimated, and as a result, we reduced the estimated remaining useful life of
the satellite from approximately seven years to approximately six years effective January 2005.
EchoStar V has been utilized as an in-orbit spare since February 2003. On June 30, 2005, the FCC
approved our request to use this satellite to provide service to the United States from a third
party Canadian DBS orbital slot located at the 129 degree orbital location. Due to the increase in
fuel consumption resulting from the relocation of EchoStar V from the 119 degree orbital location
to the 129 degree orbital location, effective July 1, 2005, we further reduced the satellite’s
estimated remaining useful life from approximately six years to approximately 40 months. These
reductions in estimated remaining useful life during 2005 increased our depreciation expense
related to the satellite by approximately $9.2 million in 2005 and will increase it by
approximately $15.3 million annually thereafter. Prior to 2005, EchoStar V experienced anomalies
resulting in the loss of five solar array strings out of a total of 96 available, reducing solar
array power to approximately 95% of its original capacity. During August 2005, EchoStar V lost an
additional solar array string. The loss is not expected to impact commercial operation of the
satellite or its remaining useful life. There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not
further impact the useful life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VI.

EchoStar VI, which currently operates at the 110 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 225 watts per channel. This satellite has a total of 108
solar array strings. Approximately 102 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year estimated useful life of the satellite. Prior to 2005, EchoStar VI lost a total
of five solar array strings. During 2005, EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss
of 11 additional solar array strings bringing the total number of string losses to 16, and reducing
the number of functional solar array strings available to 92. The solar array anomalies will
prevent the use of some of those transponders for the full 12-year estimated useful life of the
satellite. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the solar array
anomalies have not impacted commercial operation of the satellite or reduced its estimated useful
life below 12 years. There can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses
which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VII.

EchoStar VII, which currently operates at the 119 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel. Each transponder can transmit
multiple digital video, audio and data channels. EchoStar VII also includes spot beam technology.
During 2004, our EchoStar VII satellite lost a solar array circuit. EchoStar VII was designed with
24 solar array circuits and needs 23 for the spacecraft to be fully operational at end of life.
While this anomaly is not expected to reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less
than 12 years and has not impacted commercial operation of the satellite to date, an investigation
of the anomaly is continuing. Until the root causes are finally determined, there can be no assurance future
anomalies will not cause further losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.



EchoStar VIII.

EchoStar VIII, which currently operates at the 110 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel. EchoStar VIII also includes
spot-beam technology. During January 2005, one of the computer components in its control
electronics experienced an anomaly. The processors were successfully reset during April 2005,
restoring full redundancy in the spacecraft control electronics. During July 2005, a thruster
experienced a “bubble” event in a propellant line which caused improper pointing of the satellite
resulting in a loss of service. Service was restored within several hours and the thruster is
currently operating normally. During February 2005, EchoStar VIII lost a solar array string,
reducing solar array power to approximately 99% of its original capacity. Until the root cause of
these anomalies are determined, there can be no assurance that a repeat of the July 2005 anomaly,
or other anomalies, will not cause further losses which could materially impact its commercial
operation, or result in a total loss of the satellite. These and other anomalies previously
disclosed have not reduced the 12-year estimated useful life of the satellite. We depend on
EchoStar VIII to provide local channels to over 40 markets at least until such time as our EchoStar
X satellite has commenced commercial operation, which is currently expected during second quarter
2006. In the event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could
transmit many, but not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

EchoStar IX.

EchoStar IX, which currently operates at the 121 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 Ku-band transponders at approximately 110 watts per channel, along with
transponders that can provide services in Ka-Band (a “Ka-band payload”). EchoStar IX provides
expanded video and audio channels to DISH Network subscribers who install a specially-designed
dish. The Ka-band spectrum is being used to test and verify potential future broadband initiatives
and to implement those services. The satellite also includes a C-band payload which is owned by a
third party.

EchoStar X.

EchoStar X, a DBS satellite which can operate up to 49 spot beams using up
to 42 active 140 watt TWTAs, was launched on February 15, 2006. Assuming successful completion of
in-orbit testing, the satellite is expected to commence commercial operations during the second
quarter of 2006 at the 110 degree orbital location. The spot beams on EchoStar X are designed to
increase the number of markets where we can offer local channels by satellite, including high
definition local channels.

EchoStar XII.

EchoStar XII, previously known as Rainbow 1, currently operates at the 61.5 degree
orbital location. This direct broadcast satellite, which was purchased in November 2005 from
Rainbow DBS Co., a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation, was designed to provide all
CONUS, all Spot Beam, or a mixture of CONUS and Spot Beam coverage. In the all CONUS
configuration, the spacecraft can operate 13 transponders (26 TWTAs) at 270 watts per channel. In
the all Spot Beam mode, the spacecraft can operate up to 22 spot beams using a combination of 135
and 65 watt TWTAs. We are currently using the payload in the all CONUS configuration.

EchoStar XII experienced one north solar array circuit failure during May 2005 and one south solar
array circuit failure during September 2004. The south solar array circuit has since partially
recovered. The reason for the failures is unknown, but believed to be caused by an internal
electrical short circuit. While this anomaly is not expected to reduce the remaining useful life
of the satellite to less than 10 years and has not impacted commercial operation of the satellite
to date, an investigation of the anomaly is continuing. Until the root causes are finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses, which could
impact commercial operation of the satellite.



Leased Satellites

We currently lease three in-orbit satellites.

AMC-2.

AMC-2 currently operates at the 85 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS
satellite is equipped with 24 medium power Ku FSS transponders. Our lease of this satellite is
scheduled to continue through 2006.

AMC-15.

AMC-15 currently operates at the 105 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS
satellite is equipped with 24 Ku FSS transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per
channel and a Ka FSS payload consisting of 12 spot beams. We currently use the capacity on AMC-15
to offer a combination of programming including local channels. This programming is expected to be
transferred to our EchoStar X satellite following completion of in-orbit testing. We currently do
not have a plan to utilize the capacity of AMC-15 once this programming is transferred to EchoStar
X. We could use this satellite to offer local network channels in additional markets, together
with satellite-delivered high-speed internet services.

AMC-16

.

AMC-16 is currently located at the 85 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS
satellite is virtually identical to AMC-15 and is equipped with 24 Ku FSS transponders that operate
at approximately 120 watts per channel and a Ka FSS payload consisting of 12 spot beams capable of
covering CONUS from the 85 degree orbital location. We could use this satellite to offer local
network channels in additional markets, together with satellite-delivered high-speed internet
services. We have applied to the FCC for permission to use the AMC-16 satellite at the 118.7
degree orbital location.

Satellites under Construction

We have entered into contracts to construct six new satellites.

•

EchoStar XI, a Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (“SSL”) DBS satellite, is expected to be
completed during 2007. EchoStar XI will enable better bandwidth utilization, provide
back-up protection for our existing offerings, and could allow DISH Network to offer other
value-added services.

•

Five additional SSL Ka and/or Ku expanded band satellites are contractually scheduled to
be completed during 2008 and 2009 and will enable better bandwidth utilization and could
allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services including 2-way broadband and video.

We have also entered into satellite service agreements to lease capacity on three additional
satellites currently under construction.

•

An SES Americom DBS satellite (AMC-14) expected to launch during late 2006 and commence
commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. This
satellite could be used as additional backup capacity and to offer other value-added
services.

•

The Telesat Anik F3 FSS satellite expected to launch during 2006 and commence commercial
operation at the 118.7 degree orbital location. This satellite could allow DISH Network to
offer other value-added services.

•

A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently scheduled to be launched during
2008 and is expected to be located at the 129 degree orbital location.

We are significantly increasing our satellite capacity as a result of the agreements discussed
above and other satellite service agreements currently under negotiation. While we are currently
evaluating various opportunities to make profitable use of this capacity (including, but not
limited to, launching satellite two-way and wireless broadband, increasing our international
programming and other services, and expanding our local and HD programming), we do not have firm
plans to utilize all of the additional satellite capacity we expect to acquire. In addition, there
can be no assurance that we can successfully develop the business opportunities we currently plan
to pursue with this additional capacity. Future costs associated with this additional capacity
will negatively impact our margins if we
do not have sufficient growth in subscribers or in demand for new programming or services to
generate revenue to offset the costs of this increased capacity.



Components of a DBS System

Overview

.

In order to provide programming services to DISH Network subscribers, we have entered
into agreements with video, audio and data programmers who generally make their programming content
available to our digital broadcast operations centers via commercial satellites or fiber optic
networks. We monitor those signals for quality, and can add promotional messages, public service
programming, advertising, and other information. Equipment at our digital broadcast operations
centers then digitizes, compresses, encrypts and combines the signal with other necessary data,
such as conditional access information. We then “uplink” or transmit the signals to one or more of
our satellites and broadcast directly to DISH Network subscribers.

In order to receive DISH Network programming, a subscriber needs:

•

a satellite antenna, which people sometimes refer to as a “dish,” and related components;

•

a “satellite receiver” or “set-top box”; and

•

a television.

EchoStar Receiver Systems

.

EchoStar receiver systems include a small satellite dish, a digital
satellite receiver that decrypts and decompresses signals for television viewing, a remote control
and other related components. We offer a number of set-top box models. Our standard system comes
with an infrared universal remote control, an on-screen interactive program guide and V-chip type
technology for parental control. Our premium models include a hard disk drive enabling additional
features such as digital video recording of more than 210 hours of programming and a UHF/infrared
universal remote. Certain of our standard and premium systems allow independent satellite TV
viewing on two separate televisions. We also offer a variety of specialized products including HD
receivers. Set-top boxes communicate with our authorization center through telephone lines to,
among other things, report the purchase of pay-per-view movies and other events. DISH Network
reception equipment is incompatible with our competitors’ systems.

Although we internally design and engineer our receiver systems, we out-source manufacturing to
high-volume contract electronics manufacturers. Sanmina-SCI Corporation is the primary
manufacturer of our receiver systems. JVC and Celetronix USA, Inc. also manufacture some of our
receiver systems.

We depend on a few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for the production of
our receivers and many components of our EchoStar receiver systems that we provide to subscribers.
Although there can be no assurance, we do not believe that the loss of any single manufacturer
would materially impact our business.

Conditional Access System

.

We use conditional access technology to encrypt our programming so only
those who pay can receive it. We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called
“smart cards,” or in security chips in the satellite receiver, together referred to as “security
access devices,” to control access to authorized programming content. We own 50% of NagraStar
L.L.C., a joint venture that provides us with security access devices. Nagra USA, a subsidiary of
the Kudelski Group, owns the other 50% of NagraStar. NagraStar purchases these security access
devices from NagraCard SA, a Swiss company which is also a subsidiary of the Kudelski Group. These
security access devices, certain aspects of which we can upgrade over the air or replace
periodically, are a key element in preserving the security of our conditional access system. When
a consumer orders a particular channel, we send a message by satellite that instructs the security
access devices to permit decryption of the programming for viewing by that consumer. The set-top
box then decompresses the programming and sends it to the consumer’s television.

It is illegal to create, sell or otherwise distribute mechanisms or devices to circumvent that
encryption. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further
compromised in the future. Theft of our programming reduces future potential revenue and increases
our net subscriber acquisition costs. In addition, theft of our competitors’ programming can also
increase our churn. Compromises of our encryption technology could also adversely affect our
ability to contract for video and audio services provided by programmers. We continue to respond
to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our



programming more difficult. In order to combat theft of our service and maintain the functionality
of active set-top boxes, we recently replaced the majority of our older generation smart cards with
newer generation smart cards. These existing smart cards have been compromised, and we are
implementing software patches and other security measures to help secure our service. However,
there can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our
programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost of card
replacements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, profitability and
cash flows. Furthermore, other illegal methods that compromise satellite programming signals may
be developed in the future. If we cannot control compromises of our encryption technology, our
revenue, net subscriber acquisition costs, churn and our ability to contract for video and audio
services provided by programmers could be materially adversely affected.

Installation

.

While some consumers have the skills necessary to install our equipment in their
homes, we believe that most installations are best performed by professionals, and that on time,
quality installations are important to our success. Consequently, we are continuing to expand our
installation business, which is conducted through our DISH Network Service L.L.C. subsidiary. We
use both employees and independent contractors for professional installations. Independent
installers are held to DISH Network Service L.L.C. service standards to attempt to ensure each DISH
Network customer receives the same quality installation and service. Our offices and independent
installers are strategically located throughout the continental United States. Although there can
be no assurance, we believe that our internal installation business helps to improve quality
control, decrease wait time on service calls and new installations and helps us better accommodate
anticipated subscriber growth.

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers

.

Our principal digital broadcast operations centers are
located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona. Almost all of the functions necessary to
provide satellite-delivered services occur at those locations. The digital broadcast operations
centers use fiber optic lines and downlink antennas to receive programming and other data from
content providers. For most local channels, the programming signals are encoded in the originating
city and then backhauled via fiber to our digital broadcast operation centers. These centers then
uplink programming content to our direct broadcast satellites. Equipment at our digital broadcast
operations centers performs substantially all compression and encryption of DISH Network’s
programming signals. We have also built five new regional digital broadcast operations centers
that will allow us to better utilize the spot beam capabilities of our satellites.

Customer Service Centers

.

We currently operate 11 owned or out-sourced customer service centers
fielding most of our customer service calls. Potential and existing subscribers can call a single
telephone number to receive assistance for hardware, programming, billing, installation and
technical support. We continue to work to automate simple phone responses and to increase
Internet-based customer assistance in order to better manage customer service costs and improve the
customer’s self-service experience.

Subscriber Management

.

We presently use, and are dependent on, CSG Systems International, Inc.’s
software system for the majority of DISH Network subscriber billing and related functions.



Competition for our Dish Network Business

We compete in the subscription television service industry against other DBS television providers,
cable television and other system operators offering video, audio and data programming and
entertainment services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing
and other resources than we have. Our earnings and other operating metrics could be materially
adversely affected if we are unable to compete successfully with these and other new providers of
multi-channel video programming services.

Cable Television

.

Cable television operators have a large, established customer base, and many
cable operators have significant investments in, and access to, programming. Of the total U.S.
households in which cable television service was available as of June 30, 2005 approximately 60%
subscribed to cable. Cable television operators continue to leverage their advantages relative to
satellite operators by, among other things, bundling their analog video service with expanded
digital video services, 2-way high speed internet access, and telephone services. Cable television
operators with analog systems are also able to provide service to multiple television sets within
the same household at a lesser incremental cost to the consumer, and they are able to provide local
and other programming in a larger number of geographic areas. As a result of these and other
factors, we may not be able to continue to expand our subscriber base or compete effectively
against cable television operators.

Some digital cable platforms currently offer a VOD service that enables subscribers to choose from
a library of programming selections for viewing at their convenience. We are continuing to develop
our own VOD service alternative which was launched on a limited scale during 2005. There can be no
assurance that our VOD service will be successful in competing with other video providers.

DBS and Other Direct-to-Home System Operators

.

News Corporation owns a 34% controlling interest in
the DirecTV Group, Inc. (“DirecTV”). News Corporation’s diverse world-wide satellite, content and
other related businesses may provide competitive advantages to DirecTV with respect to the
acquisition of programming, content and other assets valuable to our industry. In addition,
DirecTV’s satellite receivers are sold in a significantly greater number of consumer electronics
stores than ours. As a result of this and other factors, our services are less well known to
consumers than those of DirecTV. Due to this relative lack of consumer awareness and other
factors, we are at a competitive marketing disadvantage compared to DirecTV. We believe DirecTV
continues to be in an advantageous position relative to our Company with regard to, among other
things, certain programming packages, and possibly, volume discounts for programming offers.
DirecTV recently launched two new satellites and announced plans to launch two additional new
satellites in 2007 in order to offer local and national channel programming in HD to most of the
U.S. population. Although we have recently launched our own HD initiatives, if DirecTV fully
implements these plans, we may be placed at a further competitive disadvantage compared to DirecTV.

Furthermore, other companies in the United States have conditional permits or leased transponders
for a comparatively small number of DBS assignments that can be used to provide subscription
satellite services to portions of the United States. These new entrants may have a competitive
advantage over us in deploying some new products and technologies because of the substantial costs
we may be required to incur to make new products or technologies available across our installed
base of over 12 million subscribers.

VHF/UHF Broadcasters

.

Most areas of the United States can receive traditional terrestrial VHF/UHF
television broadcasts of between three and 10 channels. These broadcasters provide local, network
and syndicated programming. The local content nature of the programming may be important to the
consumer, and VHF/UHF programming is typically provided free of charge. In addition, the FCC has
allocated additional digital spectrum to licensed broadcasters. At least during this transition
period, each existing television station will be able to retain its present analog frequencies and
also transmit programming on a digital channel that may permit multiple programming services per
channel. Our business could be adversely affected by continued free broadcast of local and other
programming and increased program offerings by traditional broadcasters.



Impact of High Definition TV

. Although we believe we currently offer more HD content than our
competitors, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage to the extent other multi-channel video
providers increase their offering
of HD programming. We could be further disadvantaged to the extent a significant number of local
broadcasters begin offering local channels in HD, unless we make substantial additional investments
in infrastructure to deliver HD programming. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
effectively compete with HD program offerings from other video providers.

New Technologies and Competitors.

New technologies could also have a material adverse effect on
the demand for our DBS services. For example, we face an increasingly significant competitive
threat from the build-out of advanced fiber optic networks. Verizon Communications, Inc.
(“Verizon”) and AT&T have begun deployment of fiber-optic networks that will allow them to offer
video services bundled with traditional phone and high speed internet directly to millions of homes
as early as the second half of 2006. In addition, telephone companies and other entities are also
implementing and supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines and digital
“wireless cable” which may allow them to offer video services without having to build a new
infrastructure. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who
distribute video services directly to consumers over the internet.

With the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of
video content has become available on the Internet for users to download and view on their personal
computers and other devices. In addition, there are several initiatives by companies to make it
easier to view Internet-based video on television and personal computer screens. We also expect to
face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly
to consumers via digital air waves.

Mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable television
operators, telephone companies and others also may result in providers capable of offering
television services in competition with us. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using
existing and new technologies to offer bundles of television and telecommunications services that
may prove to be more competitive than our current offerings. As a result, we may not be able to
compete successfully with existing competitors or new entrants in the market for television
services.

ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

EchoStar Technologies Corporation (“ETC”), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, designs and
develops EchoStar receiver systems. Our satellite receivers have won numerous awards from the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, retailers and industry trade publications. We
out-source the manufacture of EchoStar receiver systems to third parties who manufacture the
receivers in accordance with our specifications.

The primary purpose of our ETC division is to support the DISH Network. However, in addition to
supplying EchoStar receiver systems and related accessories for the DISH Network, ETC also sells
similar digital satellite receivers internationally, either directly to television service
operators or to our independent distributors worldwide. This has created a source of additional
business for us and synergies that directly benefit DISH Network. For example, our satellite
receivers are designed around the Digital Video Broadcasting standard, which is widely used in
Europe and Asia. The same employees who design EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network are
also involved in designing set-top boxes sold to international TV customers. Consequently, we
benefit from the possibility that ETC’s international projects may result in improvements in design
and economies of scale in the production of EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network.

We believe that DTH satellite service is particularly well-suited for countries without extensive
cable infrastructure, and we are actively soliciting new business for ETC. However, there can be
no assurance that ETC will be able to develop additional international sales or maintain its
existing business.

Through 2005, our primary international customer was Bell ExpressVu, a subsidiary of Bell Canada,
Canada’s national telephone company. We currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell
ExpressVu, and we are actively trying to secure new orders from other potential international
customers. However, we cannot guarantee at this time that those negotiations will be successful.
Our future international revenue depends largely on the success of these and other international
operators, which in turn, depends on other factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of DTH
satellite TV products and the increasing intensity of competition for international subscription
television subscribers.



ETC’s business also includes our Atlanta-based EchoStar Data Networks Corporation and our UK-based
Eldon Technology Limited (“Eldon Technology”) subsidiaries. EchoStar Data Networks is a supplier
of technology for distributing Internet and other content over satellite networks. Eldon
Technology designs and tests various software and other technology used in digital televisions and
set-top boxes, strengthening our product design capabilities for satellite receivers and integrated
televisions in both the international and United States markets.

Competition for Our ETC Business

Through ETC, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, many of which
have significantly greater resources, financial or otherwise, than we have. We expect new
competitors to enter this market because of rapidly changing technology. Our ability to anticipate
these technological changes and introduce enhanced products expeditiously will be a significant
factor in our ability to remain competitive. We do not know if we will be able to successfully
introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis in order to remain competitive.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FCC. We are also regulated by other federal
agencies, state and local authorities and the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”).
Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by
these entities could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the
termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal
penalties.

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is not intended to describe all
present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting the video programming
distribution industry. Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or
administrative proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change our
industry to varying degrees. We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or any
potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations.

FCC Regulation under the Communications Act

FCC Jurisdiction over our Operations.

The Communications Act gives the FCC broad authority to
regulate the operations of satellite companies. Specifically, the Communications Act gives the FCC
regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relating to communications satellite operations:

In order to obtain FCC satellite licenses and authorizations, satellite operators must satisfy
strict legal, technical and financial qualification requirements. Once issued, these licenses and
authorizations are subject to a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of ongoing due diligence obligations,
construction milestones, and various reporting requirements.



Our Basic DBS Frequency Licenses and Authorizations.

Most of our programming is transmitted to our
customers on frequencies in the 12.2 to 12.7 GHz range, which we refer to as the “DBS” frequencies.
We are licensed or authorized by the FCC to operate DBS frequencies at the following orbital
locations:

•

22 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location;

•

29 frequencies at the 110 degree orbital location;

•

21 frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location; and

•

32 frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location.

We also sublease six transponders (corresponding to six frequencies) at the 61.5 degree orbital
location from licensee Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. (“Dominion”). In addition, we were the
winning bidder for the remaining 29 DBS frequencies at the 157 degree orbital location at an FCC
auction conducted in July 2004. However, the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals overturned the
auction and the FCC has not yet decided how it will allocate those orbital slots and frequencies.
We have also applied for the two remaining frequencies at the 61.5 slot. We cannot be certain that
the FCC will ultimately grant us the licenses for the additional frequencies at 61.5 or 157.

Duration of our Satellite Licenses and Authorizations.

Generally speaking, all of our satellite
licenses are subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC. While under a recent FCC rulemaking
the term of certain satellite licenses has been extended from 10 to 15 years, the term of DBS
licenses remains at 10 years; our licenses are currently set to expire at various times starting as
early as November 2006. In addition, our special temporary authorizations are granted for periods
of only 180 days or less, subject again to possible renewal by the FCC.

Opposition and other Risks to our Licenses and Authorizations.

Several third parties have opposed,
and we expect them to continue to oppose, some of our FCC satellite authorizations and pending
requests to the FCC for extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses. In
addition, we may not have fully complied with all of the FCC reporting and filing requirements in
connection with our satellite authorizations. Because of this opposition and our failure to comply
with certain requirements of our authorizations, it is possible the FCC could revoke, terminate,
condition or decline to extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses.

Our FSS Licenses.

In addition to our DBS licenses and authorizations, we have received conditional
licenses from the FCC to operate FSS satellites in the Ka-band and the Ku-band, including licenses
to operate EchoStar IX (a hybrid Ka/Ku-band satellite) at the 121 degree orbital location. In
addition, EchoStar holds Ka-band licenses at the 97, 113 and 117 degree orbital locations, and
extended Ku-band licenses at the 109 and 121 degree orbital locations. Use of these licenses and
conditional authorizations is subject to certain technical and due diligence requirements,
including the requirement to construct and launch satellites according to specific milestones and
deadlines. Our projects to construct and launch Ku-band, extended Ku-band and Ka-band satellites
are in various stages of development.

Risks to our Ka-Band and Ku-Band Authorizations.

Our Ka-band license at the 121 degree orbital
locations allow us to use only 500 MHz of Ka-band spectrum in each direction, while certain other
licensees have been authorized to use 1000 MHz in each direction. Our Ka-band licenses at the 97,
113 and 117 degree orbital locations are for the full 1000 MHz in each direction. With respect to
these latter Ka-band licenses, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation of the
satellites to be completed by December 2008, October 2009 and March 2009, respectively. During
2004, we submitted satellite construction contracts to the FCC for the proposed Ka-band satellites
at the 97 and 117 degree orbital locations. The FCC subsequently ruled that these contracts comply
with the first construction milestone requirement. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we changed
satellite vendors and submitted the revised contracts for the Ka satellites at the 97 and 117
orbital locations and a new contract for the Ka satellite at the 113 orbital location. In December
2005, we conducted the critical design review for the Ka satellite at the 117 orbital location as
required by the conditions of our license. In March 2006, the FCC ruled that we had successfully
met the requirements for meeting the critical design review milestone for the 117 degree orbital location contract.
We cannot be sure that the FCC will rule that these



new contracts we submitted comply with their first construction milestone or critical design review
milestone requirements. Moreover, ITU deadlines required Ka-band satellites to be operating at the
97, 113 and 117 degree orbital locations by June of 2005. For our extended Ku-band satellites at
the 109 and 121 degree orbital locations, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation of
the satellites to be completed by September 2009. We recently submitted construction contracts to
the FCC for these two satellites. There can be no assurance that we will develop acceptable plans
to meet all of these deadlines, or that we will be able to utilize any of these orbital slots.

Recent FCC Rulemaking Affecting our Licenses and Applications.

The FCC changed its system for
processing applications to a “first-come, first-served” process. Since that change became
effective, we have filed or refiled, and have pending before the FCC, new applications for as many
as five satellites in several different frequency bands. Several of our direct or indirect
competitors have filed petitions to deny or dismiss certain of our pending applications or have
requested that conditions be placed on authorizations we requested. We received conditional
Ka-band licenses for the 97, 113 and 117 degree orbital locations, and extended Ku-band licenses
for the 109 and 121 degree orbital locations, while a number of our other applications have been
denied or dismissed without prejudice by the FCC. We cannot be sure that the FCC will grant any of
our outstanding applications, or that the authorizations, if granted, will not be subject to
onerous conditions. Moreover, the cost of building, launching and insuring a satellite can be as
much as $250.0 million or more, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to construct and launch
all of the satellites for which we have requested authorizations. The FCC has also imposed a $3.0
million (previously $5.0 million) bond requirement for all future satellite licenses, which would
be forfeited by a licensee that does not meet its diligence milestones for a particular satellite.
We have provided the FCC with letters of credit, collateralized by approximately $14.2 million of
our restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of December 31, 2005, to satisfy this
requirement for all of our Ka-band and extended Ku-band licenses.

Satellite License Auction Proceedings.

The FCC has proposed to auction licenses for two DBS
frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location. In 2004, the FCC ruled that DBS providers that
hold DBS licenses at orbital locations capable of serving the entire continental United States
(including EchoStar) would not be eligible to bid for the license for the two frequencies at the
61.5 degree orbital location, and would not be qualified to acquire that license for a period of
four years following grant. We have requested a reconsideration of this ruling which Dominion
subsequently opposed. As a result, we cannot be certain of a positive outcome.

Expansion DBS Spectrum

.

The FCC has also allocated additional expansion spectrum for DBS services
commencing in 2007. This could create significant additional competition in the market for
subscription television services. We filed applications for this additional spectrum during March
2002 but cannot predict whether the FCC will grant these applications.

Other Services in the DBS Band.

The FCC has also adopted rules that allow non-geostationary orbit
fixed satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency band as direct
broadcast satellite and Ku-band-based fixed satellite services. In the same rulemaking, the FCC
authorized use of the DBS spectrum that we use, by terrestrial communication services and it
auctioned licenses for these terrestrial services during January 2004. There can be no assurance
that operations by non-geostationary orbit fixed satellite services or terrestrial communication
services in the DBS band will not interfere with our DBS operations and adversely affect our
business.

Proposals to allow 4.5 Degree Spacing.

During 2002, SES Americom, Inc. requested a declaratory
ruling that it is in the public interest for SES Americom to offer satellite capacity for third
party DTH services to consumers in the United States and certain British Overseas Territories in
the Caribbean. SES Americom proposes to employ a satellite licensed by the Government of Gibraltar
to operate in the same uplink and downlink frequency bands as us, from an orbital position located
in between two orbital locations where EchoStar and DirecTV have already positioned satellites.
DirecTV, which opposes SES’s petition, has itself filed a petition for rulemaking for standards to
permit such 4.5 degree spacing. During January 2004, we filed comments in response to DirecTV’s
petition for rulemaking. The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the U.S. from
closer-spaced DBS slots may permit additional competition against us from other DBS providers.

Competition for Canadian Orbital Slots.

DirecTV requested and obtained FCC authority to provide
service to the United States from a Canadian DBS orbital slot. We have also requested and
subsequently received authority to do the same from the Canadian DBS orbital slot at 129 degrees.
A similar request to use an FSS orbital slot at 118.7
degrees remains pending. The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the U.S. from foreign
slots may permit additional competition against us from other DBS providers.



Rules Relating to Alaska and Hawaii.

The holders of DBS authorizations issued after January 1996
must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii if such service is technically feasible from the
authorized orbital location. Our authorizations at the 110 degree and 148 degree orbital locations
were received after January 1996. While we provide service to Alaska and Hawaii from both the 110
and 119 degree orbital locations, those states have expressed the view that our service should more
closely resemble our service to the mainland United States and otherwise needs improvement. We
received temporary conditional waivers of the service requirement for the 148 degree orbital
location. However, the FCC could revoke these waivers at any time.

The FCC has also concluded a rulemaking which seeks to streamline and revise its rules governing
DBS operators. In connection with this rulemaking, the FCC clarified its geographic service
requirements to introduce a requirement that we provide programming packages to residents of Hawaii
and Alaska that are “reasonably comparable” to what we offer in the contiguous 48 states. We
cannot be sure that this requirement will not affect us adversely by requiring us to devote
additional resources to serving these two states.

A La Carte.

Some Members of Congress have proposed the imposition of indecency restrictions on
satellite and cable providers. Others, together with the Chairman of the FCC, have suggested that
satellite and cable providers be required to offer some or all programming on an individual, or “a
la carte” basis. We cannot predict the effect any such obligations would have on our business.

Emergency Alert System.

The Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) requires participants to interrupt
programming during nationally-declared emergencies and to pass through emergency-related
information. The FCC recently released an order requiring satellite carriers to participate in the
“national” portion of EAS. It is also considering whether to mandate that satellite carriers also
interrupt programming for local emergencies and weather events. We believe any such requirement
would be difficult to implement, would require costly changes to our system and depending on how it
is implemented, could inconvenience or confuse our viewers.

Other Communications Act Provisions

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services.

The FCC imposes different rules for “subscription” and
“broadcast” services. We believe that because we offer a subscription programming service, we are
not subject to many of the regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees. However, we
cannot be certain whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory
obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we be treated as a
broadcaster. If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast licensee, it could require us to comply
with all regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees, which are generally subject to
more burdensome regulation than subscription television service providers.

Public Interest Requirements.

Under a requirement of the Cable Act, the FCC imposed public
interest requirements on DBS licensees. These rules require us to set aside four percent of our
channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial programming for which we must charge programmers
below-cost rates and for which we may not impose additional charges on subscribers. This could
displace programming for which we could earn commercial rates and could adversely affect our
financial results. The FCC has generally not reviewed all aspects of our methodology for
processing public interest carriage requests, computing the channel capacity we must set aside or
determining the rates that we charge public interest programmers. We cannot be sure that if the
FCC were to review these methodologies it would find them in compliance with the public interest
requirements.

Moreover, certain parties have challenged certain aspects of our methodology for processing public
interest carriage requests in a pending proceeding, and we received a letter from the FCC’s
Enforcement Bureau regarding these issues. We cannot be sure that the Commission will not take
enforcement action against us, which may result in fines and/or changes to our methodology for
compliance with these rules. The FCC’s Enforcement Bureau is also investigating the public
interest qualifications of a programmer that at one time occupied a channel of public interest
capacity on our system.



Other Open Access Requirements.

The FCC has also commenced an open access proceeding regarding
distribution of high-speed Internet access services and interactive television services. We cannot
be sure that the FCC will not ultimately impose open access obligations on us, which could be very
onerous, and could create a significant strain on our capacity and ability to provide other
services.

Plug and Play.

The FCC adopted the so-called “plug and play” standard for compatibility between
digital television sets and cable systems. That standard was developed through negotiations
involving the cable and consumer electronics industries, but not us, and we are concerned that it
may impose certain onerous “encoding rules” on all multi-channel video programming distributors,
including us, and that the standard and its implementation process favor cable systems. We have
filed a petition for review of the FCC’s “plug and play” order with the federal Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit on various grounds, but we cannot be sure that the court will
not uphold the FCC’s decision.

Closed Captioning.

The FCC recently initiated a rulemaking proceeding seeking comments on whether
its rules that require broadcasters, DBS providers and cable operators to transmit closed captioned
content should be revised. We currently do not have the capability of captioning every channel
that we carry and rely on the program originators to perform this task. No technology exists that
can be applied outside the program originator’s facility to determine if a program is correctly
captioned. If we are required to monitor every one of the thousands of programs that we carry to
ensure accurate captioning, we will bear substantial equipment, personnel and other related costs.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization
Act

Retransmission of Distant Networks.

The Copyright Act, as amended by the Satellite Home Viewer
Improvement Act, or “SHVIA,” permits satellite retransmission of distant broadcast channels only to
“unserved households.” An example of a distant network station retransmission is a Los Angeles
broadcast network station retransmitted by satellite to a subscriber outside of the Los Angeles
market. That subscriber qualifies as an “unserved household” if he or she cannot receive, over the
air, a signal of sufficient intensity (“Grade B” intensity) from a Los Angeles station affiliated
with the same broadcast network.

SHVIA has also established a process whereby consumers predicted to be served by a local station
may request that this station waive the unserved household limitation so that the requesting
consumer may receive distant signals by satellite. If the waiver request is denied, SHVIA entitles
the consumer to request an actual test, with the cost to be borne by either the satellite carrier,
such as us, or the broadcast station depending on the results. The testing process required by the
statute can be very costly.

In addition, SHVIA has affected and continues to affect us adversely in several other respects.
The legislation prohibits us from carrying more than two distant signals for each broadcasting
network and leaves the FCC’s Grade B intensity standard unchanged without future legislation. The
FCC recently rejected our petition for reconsideration of its methodology for predicting whether a
particular household is served by a signal of Grade B intensity. While we have filed a petition
for federal appellate review of the FCC’s action we cannot be sure that the court will not uphold
the FCC’s decision. The FCC rules mandated by SHVIA also require us to potentially delete
substantial programming (including sports programming) from these signals. Although we have
implemented certain measures in order to comply with these rules, these requirements may
significantly hamper our ability to retransmit distant network and superstation signals. The
burdens the rules impose upon us may become so onerous that we may be required to substantially
alter, or stop retransmitting, some programming channels. In addition, the FCC’s sports blackout
requirements, which apply to all distant network signals, may require costly upgrades to our
system.

During 2004, Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act, or
“SHVERA.” SHVERA extends our legal authority to retransmit distant stations under SHVIA to
December 31, 2009, but imposes new and complex restrictions on that authority. In general, we can
no longer offer distant network stations to new subscribers in markets in which we offer local
broadcast stations. In addition, our ability to retransmit distant digital network stations today
depends on whether a household is unserved by the analog signal of the local network station.
While the statute gives us the ability to engage in signal strength testing to determine whether a
household can receive the digital signal of the local network station, this ability does not
commence until at least April 30, 2006 or July 15, 2007 (depending on the market and whether
extensions are granted), and is also subject to certain

restrictions. It is too early to fully assess all of the implications of SHVERA for our
retransmissions of distant network stations.



SHVERA also amended the royalty provisions applicable to our retransmission of distant broadcast
channels and superstations. While the initial royalty rate specified in SHVERA for analog distant
network and superstation signals is that in effect on July 1, 2004, SHVERA has increased the
initial rate for digital station retransmissions. In addition, SHVERA provides that these rates
may be modified by voluntary negotiation or through arbitration initiated by the Librarian of
Congress if no voluntary agreement is reached. While we have reached a conditional agreement with
certain (but not all) copyright owners, we may be required to submit to arbitration to obtain
agreements with others, and there is a risk we may be required to pay significantly higher royalty
rates for these distant stations as a result.

While SHVERA gives us the ability that cable operators already have to also import into a local
market certain stations from neighboring markets that are deemed “significantly viewed” in the
local market, that ability is subject to a number of restrictions, including the requirement of
receiving retransmission consent and the prohibition on importing a digital signal of better
resolution than the local digital network station that we carry.

Opposition to Our Delivery of Distant Signals.

See “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings — Distant Network
Litigation” for information regarding opposition to our delivery of distant signals.

Retransmission of Local Networks.

SHVIA generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright
license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they
originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of the local network station. If we
fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters we cannot carry their signals.
This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite
companies which provide local signals. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent
agreements with most local network stations in markets where we currently offer local channels by
satellite, roll-out of local channels in additional cities will require that we obtain additional
retransmission agreements. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will
secure new agreements upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of
which are short term.

“Must Carry” and Other Requirements.

SHVIA also imposed “must carry” requirements on DBS providers
and the FCC has adopted detailed “must carry” rules. These rules generally require that satellite
distributors carry all the local broadcast stations requesting carriage in a timely and appropriate
manner in areas where they choose to offer local programming, not just the four major networks.
Since we have limited capacity, the number of markets in which we can offer local programming is
reduced by the “must carry” requirements. The must carry legislation also includes provisions
which could expose us to material monetary penalties, and permanent prohibitions on the sale of all
local and distant broadcast channels, based on inadvertent violations of the legislation, prior
law, or the FCC rules.

At any given time, there may be one or more “must carry” complaints by broadcasters against us
pending at the FCC. The FCC has ruled against us in certain of these proceedings, and we cannot be
sure that the FCC will rule in our favor in other pending or future proceedings. Adverse rulings
could result in a decrease in the number of local areas where we can offer local network
programming. This in turn could increase churn in those markets and preclude us from offering
local broadcast channels in new markets, thereby reducing our competitiveness.

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered
by satellite to any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8,
2006. We currently offer local broadcast channels in 164 markets across the
United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish was previously required to
receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently reduced
the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely
eliminate the second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of
EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity
limitations could force us to move the local channels in some two dish markets
to different satellites, requiring subscribers in those markets to install a
second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast channels.
We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of
those markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a
market to a single dish could result in disruptions of service for a substantial
number of our customers. Further, our



ability to timely comply with this
requirement without incurring significant additional costs is dependent on,
among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite at the
129 degree orbital location until commencement of commercial operation of
EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X anomalies could force us to cease offering
local channels by satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the
single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition plan arise,
it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement
could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent subscribers are unwilling for any
reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be negatively
impacted.

In addition, while the FCC has decided for now not to impose on satellite carriers “must carry” for
HD television stations or dual digital/analog or multicast carriage obligations — i.e., additional
requirements in connection with the carriage of digital television stations that go beyond carriage
of one video signal (whether analog or standard definition digital) for each station — the FCC
still has pending rulemaking proceedings on these matters. While the FCC recently ruled against
dual and multicast carriage for cable companies, we cannot be certain that this decision will be
upheld on review, that there will not be legislation overturning it, or that it will be applied to
satellite carriers. In addition, certain parties have continued to urge the FCC to require
satellite HD television must-carry. These proceedings may result in further, even more onerous,
digital carriage requirements. HD television must-carry would likely require us to reduce the
number of markets that we are otherwise able to serve with local stations in order to carry
multiple signals for local stations in the markets that we would continue to serve.

Dependence on Cable Act for Program Access

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. The
Cable Act’s provisions prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable affiliated
programmers have been extended from October 2002 to October 2007, but this extension could be
reversed. Upon expiration of those provisions, many popular programs may become unavailable to us,
causing a loss of customers and adversely affecting our revenues and financial performance. Any
change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated
programmers to discriminate against competing businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming
could adversely affect our ability to acquire programming at all or to acquire programming on a
cost-effective basis. We believe that the FCC generally has not shown a willingness to enforce the
program access rules aggressively. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access
(or nondiscriminatory access) to programming from programmers that are affiliated with the cable
system operators.

Affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to
their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. To the extent that cable operators
deliver additional programming terrestrially in the future, they may assert that this additional
programming is also exempt from the program access laws. These restrictions on our access to
programming could materially adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these
cable providers.

The International Telecommunication Union

Our DBS system also must conform to the International Telecommunication Union, or “ITU,”
broadcasting satellite service plan. If any of our operations are not consistent with this plan,
the ITU will only provide authorization on a non-interference basis pending successful modification
of the plan or the agreement of all affected administrations to the non-conforming operations.
Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its broadcasting satellite service plan to include
the technical parameters of DBS applicants’ operations, our satellites, along with those of other
DBS operators, must not cause harmful electrical interference with other assignments that are in
conformance with the plan. Further, DBS satellites are not presently entitled to any protection
from other satellites that are in conformance with the plan. The United States government has
filed or is in the process of filing modification requests with the ITU for EchoStar I through
VIII, EchoStar X and EchoStar XII. The ITU has requested certain technical information in order to
process the requested modifications. We have cooperated, and continue to cooperate, with the FCC
in the preparation of its responses to the ITU requests. We cannot predict when the ITU will act
upon these requests for modification or if they will be made.



Export Control Regulation

We are required to obtain import and general destination export licenses from the United States
government to receive and deliver components of DTH satellite TV systems. In addition, the
delivery of satellites and related technical information for the purpose of launch by foreign
launch services providers is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that
we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products infringes on
intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those
products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or
to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims. If those
intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual
property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position.

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our products may potentially infringe.
In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and
Trademark Office issues a patent and, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in
pending patent applications of which we are not aware. Further, the process of determining
definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid often involves expensive and protracted
litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual
property licenses or the availability and cost of any such licenses. Those costs, and their impact
on our net income, could be material. Damages in patent infringement cases may also include treble
damages in certain circumstances. To the extent that we are required to pay unanticipated
royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our
liquidity and operating results. We are currently defending patent infringement actions. We
cannot be certain the courts will conclude these companies do not own the rights they claim, that
our products do not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these
persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we
would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. See “Item 3  —  Legal
Proceedings.”

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions,
water discharge and waste management. We attempt to maintain compliance with all such
requirements. We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be
material in 2006 or 2007. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have
become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements
will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may become
important factors that affect us.

If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Business

We compete with other subscription television service providers and traditional broadcasters, which
could affect our ability to grow and increase our earnings and other operating metrics.

We compete in the subscription television service industry against other DBS television providers,
cable television and other system operators offering video, audio and data programming and
entertainment services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing
and other resources than we have. Our earnings and other operating metrics could be materially
adversely affected if we are unable to compete successfully with these and other new providers of
multi-channel video programming services.

Cable television operators have a large, established customer base, and many cable operators have
significant investments in, and access to, programming. Of the total U.S. households in which
cable television service was available as of June 30, 2005 approximately 60% subscribed to cable.
Cable television operators continue to leverage their advantages relative to satellite operators
by, among other things, bundling their analog video service with expanded digital video services,
2-way high speed internet access, and telephone services. Cable television operators with analog
systems are also able to provide service to multiple television sets within the same household at a
lesser incremental cost to the consumer, and they are able to provide local and other programming
in a larger number of geographic areas. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able
to continue to expand our subscriber base or compete effectively against cable television
operators.

Some digital cable platforms currently offer a VOD service that enables subscribers to choose from
a library of programming selections for viewing at their convenience. We are continuing to develop
our own VOD service
alternative which was launched on a limited scale during 2005. There can be no assurance that our
VOD service will be successful in competing with other video providers.



News Corporation owns a 34% controlling interest in the DirecTV Group, Inc. (“DirecTV”). News
Corporation’s diverse world-wide satellite, content and other related businesses may provide
competitive advantages to DirecTV with respect to the acquisition of programming, content and other
assets valuable to our industry. In addition, DirecTV’s satellite receivers are sold in a
significantly greater number of consumer electronics stores than ours. As a result of this and
other factors, our services are less well known to consumers than those of DirecTV. Due to this
relative lack of consumer awareness and other factors, we are at a competitive marketing
disadvantage compared to DirecTV. We believe DirecTV continues to be in an advantageous position
relative to our Company with regard to, among other things, certain programming packages, and
possibly, volume discounts for programming offers. DirecTV recently launched two new satellites
and announced plans to launch two additional new satellites in 2007 in order to offer local and
national channel programming in HD to most of the U.S. population. Although we have recently
launched our own HD initiatives, if DirecTV fully implements these plans, we may be placed at a
further competitive disadvantage compared to DirecTV.

Furthermore, other companies in the United States have conditional permits or leased transponders
for a comparatively small number of DBS assignments that can be used to provide subscription
satellite services to portions of the United States. These new entrants may have a competitive
advantage over us in deploying some new products and technologies because of the substantial costs
we may be required to incur to make new products or technologies available across our installed
base of over 12 million subscribers.

Most areas of the United States can receive traditional terrestrial VHF/UHF television broadcasts
of between three and 10 channels. These broadcasters provide local, network and syndicated
programming. The local content nature of the programming may be important to the consumer, and
VHF/UHF programming is typically provided free of charge. In addition, the FCC has allocated
additional digital spectrum to licensed broadcasters. At least during this transition period, each
existing television station will be able to retain its present analog frequencies and also transmit
programming on a digital channel that may permit multiple programming services per channel. Our
business could be adversely affected by continued free broadcast of local and other programming and
increased program offerings by traditional broadcasters.

Although we believe we currently offer more HD content than our competitors, we may be placed at a
competitive disadvantage to the extent other multi-channel video providers increase their offering
of HD programming. We could be further disadvantaged to the extent a significant number of local
broadcasters begin offering local channels in HD, unless we make substantial additional investments
in infrastructure to deliver HD programming. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
effectively compete with HD program offerings from other video providers.

New technologies could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for our DBS services. For
example, we face an increasingly significant competitive threat from the build-out of advanced
fiber optic networks. Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and AT&T have begun deployment of
fiber-optic networks that will allow them to offer video services bundled with traditional phone and high speed internet directly to millions of homes as
early as the second half of 2006. In addition, telephone companies and other entities are also
implementing and supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines and digital
“wireless cable” which may allow them to offer video services without having to build a new
infrastructure. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who
distribute video services directly to consumers over the internet.

With the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of
video content has become available on the Internet for users to download and view on their personal
computers and other devices. In addition, there are several initiatives by companies to make it
easier to view Internet-based video on television and personal computer screens. We also expect to
face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly
to consumers via digital air waves.

Mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable television
operators, telephone companies and others also may result in providers capable of offering
television services in competition with us. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using
existing and new technologies to offer bundles of television and telecommunications services that
may prove to be more competitive than our current offerings. As a result, we may not be able to
compete successfully with existing competitors or new entrants in the market for television
services.



Satellite programming signals have been subject to theft, which could cause us to lose subscribers
and revenue.

It is illegal to create, sell or otherwise distribute mechanisms or devices to circumvent that
encryption. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further
compromised in the future. Theft of our
programming reduces future potential revenue and increases our net subscriber acquisition costs.
In addition, theft of our competitors’ programming can also increase our churn. Compromises of our
encryption technology could also adversely affect our ability to contract for video and audio
services provided by programmers. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system
with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. In order
to combat theft of our service and maintain the functionality of active set-top boxes, we recently
replaced the majority of our older generation smart cards with newer generation smart cards. These
existing smart cards have been compromised, and we are implementing software patches and other
security measures to help secure our service. However, there can be no assurance that our security
measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to
replace existing smart cards, the cost of card replacements could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, other illegal methods that
compromise satellite programming signals may be developed in the future. If we cannot control
compromises of our encryption technology, our revenue, net subscriber acquisition costs, churn and
our ability to contract for video and audio services provided by programmers could be materially
adversely affected.

Increased subscriber turnover could harm our financial performance.

Our subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited
to, an increase in competition from other multi-channel video providers and new technology entrants, signal theft, and increasingly complex products. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively
higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow
consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers and these subscribers typically
churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in
a smaller economic loss upon disconnect.

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered
by satellite to any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8,
2006. We currently offer local broadcast channels in 164 markets across the
United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish was previously required to
receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently reduced
the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely
eliminate the second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of
EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity
limitations could force us to move the local channels in some two dish markets
to different satellites, requiring subscribers in those markets to install a
second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast channels.
We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of
those markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a
market to a single dish could result in disruptions of service for a substantial
number of our customers. Further, our ability to timely comply with this
requirement without incurring significant additional costs is dependent on,
among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite at the
129 degree orbital location until commencement of commercial operation of
EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X anomalies could force us to cease offering
local channels by satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the
single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition plan arise,
it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement
could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent subscribers are unwilling for any
reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be negatively
impacted.

In addition, we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets
at least until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the
event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but
not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites. The potential relocation of some
channels, and elimination of others, resulting from failures relating to EchoStar X or EchoStar
VIII, could cause a material adverse impact on our business, including, among other things, a
reduction in revenues, an increase in operating expenses, a decrease in new subscriber activations
and an increase in subscriber churn.



Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing the delivery of
superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate delivery of network channels and
superstations to a substantial number of our
subscribers, which could cause many of those customers to cancel their subscription to our other
services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the Miami District Court’s network litigation
injunction, and if we do not reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will
attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network channels, including
migration to local channels by satellite where available, and free off air antenna offers in other
markets. However, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many subscribers might
ultimately cancel their primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their
distant network channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all
subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we are permanently
enjoined from delivering all distant network channels. Termination of distant network programming
to subscribers would result in, among other things, a reduction in monthly average revenue per DISH
Network subscriber and a temporary increase in subscriber churn.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. There can be no assurance that our existing security measures will not
be compromised or that any future security measures we may implement will be effective in reducing
theft of our programming signals.

Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base continues to increase, even if percentage
subscriber churn remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network
subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth.

Increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs could adversely affect our financial
performance.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the
cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our costs to
acquire subscribers, and to a lesser extent our subscriber retention costs, can vary significantly
from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and free cash
flow. Our average subscriber acquisition costs were approximately $439 per new subscriber
activation during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to approximately $444 per new
subscriber activation during 2004.

Subscriber acquisition costs exclude the value of receiver system equipment provided to subscribers
under our DHA lease program. Because we retain ownership of such equipment, we capitalize such
costs and depreciate them over the equipment’s useful life. Our equipment lease penetration
increased during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. This reduced our average
subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, and resulted in an increase in capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the event we continue to increase our
equipment lease penetration, our average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation
will continue to be positively impacted and our capital expenditures will continue to increase. If
we included in our calculation of average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber
activation the equipment capitalized under our lease program less the value of equipment returned
and payments received, our average subscriber costs would have been approximately $668 per new
subscriber activation during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $593 per new subscriber
activation during 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to a greater number of SuperDISH
installations, as well as an increase in DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced
products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Our subscriber
acquisition costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may
materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce other more aggressive promotions
if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons.

In addition to new subscriber acquisition costs, we incur costs to retain existing subscribers,
including costs related to the programs by which we offer existing subscribers new and upgraded
equipment. We generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of our receiver
system equipment offered pursuant to our subscriber retention programs. Our capital expenditures
related to subscriber retention programs could increase in the future to the extent we increase
penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more
aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with
other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons.

Several years ago we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation
technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost
to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than
if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer



equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve,
significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing
satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the
construction of additional satellites. New channels we add to our service using only that
technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue
opportunities. We have implemented MPEG-4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers
who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology when implemented will result in
further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will
convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the
conversions will occur. Provided EchoStar X commences commercial operation during second quarter
2006 and other planned satellites are successfully deployed, our 8PSK transition will afford us
greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber
base to MPEG-4.

Any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt

As of December 31, 2005, our total debt, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was approximately
$5.935 billion. During February 2006, our total debt increased to approximately $7.005 billion
when we sold $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our ten-year, 7 1/8% Senior Notes
due February 1, 2016 and redeemed our outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009 of approximately
$442.0 million.

Our debt levels could have significant consequences, including:

In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures
relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt. If new debt is added to our
current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify.

We may need additional capital, which may not be available, in order to continue growing, to
increase earnings and to make payments on our debt.

Our ability to increase earnings and to make interest and principal payments on our debt will
depend in part on our ability to continue growing our business by maintaining and increasing our
subscriber base. This may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us.

Funds necessary to meet subscriber acquisition and retention costs are expected to be satisfied
from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations
to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet
these requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.



In addition to our DBS business plan, we have contracts to construct, and conditional licenses and
pending FCC applications for, a number of FSS Ku-band, Ka-band and extended Ku-band satellites. We
may need to raise additional capital to construct, launch, and insure satellites and complete these
systems and other satellites we may in the future apply to operate. We also periodically evaluate
various strategic initiatives, the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant
additional capital. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all.

We also have substantial satellite-related payment obligations under our various satellite service
agreements.

Our business depends substantially on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and
applications that may not be granted.

If the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations,
it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, profitability and cash flows.
Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to
us, potentially reducing the amount of programming and other services available to our subscribers.
The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the
location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, Congress
often considers and enacts legislation that could affect us, and FCC proceedings to implement the
Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing. We cannot predict the outcomes of
these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.

We are subject to significant regulatory oversight and changes in applicable regulatory
requirements could adversely affect our business.

DBS operators are subject to significant government regulation, primarily by the FCC and, to a
certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and international, state and local authorities.
Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by
these entities could result in the suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations, the
termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal
penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. You should review the regulatory disclosures under the caption “

Item 1.
Business — Government Regulation — FCC Regulation under the Communication Act, Other
Communications Act Provisions”

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may be unable to manage rapidly expanding operations.

If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. To manage our growth effectively, we
must, among other things, continue to develop our internal and external sales forces, installation
capability, customer service operations and information systems, and maintain our relationships
with third party vendors. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base,
and our management personnel must assume even greater levels of responsibility. If we are unable
to continue to manage growth effectively, we may experience a decrease in subscriber growth and an
increase in churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
profitability and cash flows.

We cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability.

Due to the substantial expenditures necessary to complete construction, launch and deployment of
our DBS system and to obtain and service DISH Network customers, we have in the past sustained
significant losses. If we do not have sufficient income or other sources of cash, our ability to
service our debt and pay our other obligations could be affected. While we had net income of
$1.515 billion, $214.8 million and $224.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, we may not be able to sustain this profitability. Improvements in our results
of operations will depend largely upon our ability to increase our customer base while maintaining
our price structure, effectively managing our costs and controlling churn. We cannot assure you
that we will be effective with regard to these matters.



Our satellites are subject to risks related to launch.

Satellite launches are subject to significant risks, including launch failure, incorrect orbital
placement or improper commercial operation. Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have
either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the past. The risks of launch
delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of
previous successful flights. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of
satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than
two years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Such significant delays could materially
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. If we were unable to obtain launch insurance,
or obtain launch insurance at rates we deem commercially reasonable, and a significant launch
failure were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues
and fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.

In addition, the occurrence of future launch failures may materially adversely affect our ability
to insure the launch of our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. Please see
further discussion under the caption “

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on our
satellites

” below.

We cannot be certain that EchoStar X will be successfully placed in commercial operation.

Our ability to timely comply with SHVERA requirements without incurring significant additional
costs is dependent on, among other things, the successful commencement of commercial operation of
our EchoStar X satellite during second quarter 2006 and continued operation of our EchoStar V
satellite at the 129 degree orbital location until that time. Delays in the commencement of
commercial operation of EchoStar X would likely require us to cease offering local channels by
satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the single dish obligation. Further, if
impediments to our preferred transition plan arise, it is possible that
the costs of compliance with this requirement could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent
subscribers are unwilling for any reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be
negatively impacted.

Our satellites are subject to significant operational risks.

Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include
malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the
satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturers’
errors, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures
resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.

Although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of
anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the
satellites, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or
arising from the failure of other systems or components.

Any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially adversely affect our operations and
revenues and our relationship with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new
customers for our direct broadcast satellites and other satellite services. In particular, future
anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders
on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly. Anomalies may
also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the revenue that could be
generated by that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement
or back-up satellites. Finally, the occurrence of anomalies may materially adversely affect our
ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. You should review
the disclosures relating to satellite anomalies set forth under Note 4 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit geosynchronous satellites. The
probability that meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth
passes through the particulate stream left behind by comets. Occasionally, increased solar
activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.

Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass through the geostationary belt
at various points, and present hazards to operational spacecraft, including our satellites. We may
be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or
could reduce the useful life of the
satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers. The loss, damage or
destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an electrostatic storm, collision with space
debris, malfunction or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.



Our satellites have minimum design lives of 12 years, but could fail or suffer reduced capacity
before then.

Our ability to earn revenue depends on the usefulness of our satellites. Each satellite has a
limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including,
among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the
ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite’s functions, the
efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion.
Generally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites is 12 years. We can provide no
assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of the satellites.

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may relocate another satellite and
use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation would
require FCC approval and, among other things, a showing to the FCC that the replacement satellite
would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be
certain that we could obtain such FCC approval. If we choose to use a satellite in this manner,
this use could adversely affect our ability to meet the operation deadlines associated with our
authorizations. Failure to meet those deadlines could result in the loss of such authorizations,
which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on our satellites.

We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures
because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite
failure. We believe that we have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously recover
transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites fails. However,
programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. For example,
we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets at least
until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the event that
EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but not all, of
those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

Complex technology used in our business could become obsolete.

Our operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to
introduce new products and services on a timely basis and to reduce costs of our existing products
and services. We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or
develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner. The success of new
product development depends on many factors, including proper identification of customer need,
cost, timely completion and introduction, differentiation from offerings of competitors and market
acceptance.

Technology in the subscription television and satellite services industries changes rapidly as new
technologies are developed, which could cause our services and products to become obsolete. We and
our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments. If the new
technologies on which we intend to focus our research and development investments fail to achieve
acceptance in the marketplace, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our future competitive
position that could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings. We may also be at a
competitive disadvantage in developing and introducing complex new products and technologies
because of the substantial costs we may incur in making these products or technologies available
across our installed base of over 12 million subscribers. For example, our competitors could be
the first to obtain proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior.
Further, after we have incurred substantial research and development costs, one or more of the
technologies under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners,
could become obsolete prior to its introduction. In addition, delays in the delivery of components
or other unforeseen problems in our DBS system or other satellite services may occur that could
materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new services and remain
competitive.



Technological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the
work of technically skilled employees. Competition for the services of these types of employees is
vigorous. We may not be able to attract and retain these employees. If we are unable to attract
and maintain technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially adversely
affected.

We depend on few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for many components of
consumer premises equipment; we may be adversely affected by product shortages.

We depend on relatively few sources, and in some cases a single source, for many components of the
consumer premises equipment that we provide to subscribers in order to deliver our digital
television services. Product shortages and resulting installation delays could cause us to lose
potential future subscribers to our DISH Network service.

We rely on key personnel.

We believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of
Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain other executives. The loss
of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Although all of our executives have
executed agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors if they leave
us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them.

We are controlled by one principal stockholder.

Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, currently beneficially owns
approximately 48% of our total equity securities and possesses approximately 73% of the total
voting power. Thus, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control
all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result of Mr. Ergen’s voting
power, ECC is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not
subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have (i) a majority of
independent directors; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors;
(iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our
executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation
committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or
recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a
nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.

We may not be aware of certain foreign government regulations.

Because regulatory schemes vary by country, we may be subject to regulations in foreign countries
of which we are not presently aware. If that were to be the case, we could be subject to sanctions
by a foreign government that could materially adversely affect our ability to operate in that
country. We cannot assure you that any current regulatory approvals held by us are, or will
remain, sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities, or that any additional necessary
approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to
operate new satellites, or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly
burdensome. The failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate satellites
internationally could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our
overall competitive position.

We, our customers and companies with which we do business may be required to have authority from
each country in which we or they provide services or provide our customers use of our satellites.
Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of our customers
and/or companies with which we do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.

Our business relies on intellectual property, some of which is owned by third parties, and we may
inadvertently infringe their patents and proprietary rights.

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that
we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products infringes on
intellectual property held by others, we may be required to



cease developing or marketing those products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the
intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid
infringing the patent claims. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we
may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our
competitive position. Please see further discussion under

Item 1. Business — Patents and
Trademarks

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our local programming strategy faces uncertainty.

SHVIA generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local
broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to
obtaining the retransmission consent of the local network station. If we fail to reach
retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters we cannot carry their signals. This could have
an adverse effect on our ability to compete with cable and other satellite companies which provide
local channels. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most local
network stations in markets where we currently offer local channels by satellite, roll-out of local
channels in additional cities will require that we obtain additional retransmission consent
agreements. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new
agreements upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are
short term.

Impediments to retransmission of distant broadcast signals; our distant programming strategy faces
uncertainty.

The Copyright Act, as amended by SHVIA, permits satellite retransmission of distant broadcast
channels only to “unserved households.” An example of a distant network station retransmission is a
Los Angeles broadcast network station retransmitted by satellite to a subscriber outside of the Los
Angeles market. That subscriber qualifies as an “unserved household” if he or she cannot receive,
over the air, a signal of sufficient intensity (“Grade B” intensity) from a Los Angeles station
affiliated with the same broadcast network.

SHVIA has also established a process whereby consumers predicted to be served by a local station
may request that this station waive the unserved household limitation so that the requesting
consumer may receive distant signals by satellite. If the waiver request is denied, SHVIA entitles
the consumer to request an actual test, with the cost to be borne by either the satellite carrier,
such as us, or the broadcast station depending on the results. The testing process required by the
statute can be very costly.

SHVERA extends our legal authority to retransmit distant stations under SHVIA to December 31, 2009,
but imposes new and complex restrictions on that authority. In general, we will no longer be able
to offer distant network stations to new subscribers in markets in which we offer local broadcast
stations. In addition, our ability to retransmit distant digital network stations today depends on
whether a household is unserved by the analog signal of the local network station. While the
statute gives us the ability to engage in signal strength testing to determine whether a household
can receive the digital signal of the local network station, this ability does not commence until
at least April 30, 2006 or July 15, 2007 (depending on the market and whether extensions are
granted), and is also subject to certain restrictions. It is too early to fully assess all of the
implications of SHVERA for our retransmissions of distant network stations. Please see further
discussion under “

Item 1. Business — Government Regulation — The Satellite Home Viewer
Improvement Act and Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act — Retransmission of
Distant Networks”

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

“Must carry” will negatively affect our ability to offer local network stations.

SHVIA also imposed “must carry” requirements on DBS providers and the FCC has adopted detailed
“must carry” rules. These rules generally require that satellite distributors carry all the local
broadcast stations requesting carriage in a timely and appropriate manner in areas where they
choose to offer local programming, not just the four major networks. Since we have limited
capacity, the number of markets in which we can offer local programming is reduced by the “must
carry” requirements. The “must carry” legislation also includes provisions which could expose us
to material monetary penalties, and permanent prohibitions on the sale of all local and distant
broadcast channels, based on inadvertent violations of the legislation, prior law, or the FCC
rules. Imposition of these penalties would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Please see further discussion under “

Improvement Act and Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act — “Must Carry” and
Other Requirements”

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



TV networks oppose our strategy of delivering distant network signals.

We are party to a lawsuit in which the FOX Broadcasting Company (“FOX’) network and the independent
affiliate groups associated with each of the four major broadcast networks have, among other
things, attempted to enjoin us from selling distant network programming. If the plaintiffs in this
lawsuit are successful in preventing us from selling distant network programming, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt to assist our
affected subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network channels, including
migration to local channels by satellite where available, and free off air antenna offers in other
markets.

However, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many of our affected subscribers would
cancel their primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all of our subscribers
in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their claims and we are permanently enjoined from delivering
all distant network channels. Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would
result, among other things, in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in subscriber churn.

Please see our more detailed discussion of this lawsuit under the caption

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
— Distant Network Litigation

.

We depend on the Cable Act for access to others’ programming.

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. The
Cable Act’s provisions prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable affiliated
programmers have been extended from October 2002 to October 2007, but this extension could be
reversed. Upon expiration of those provisions, many popular programs may become unavailable to us,
causing a loss of customers and adversely affecting our revenues and financial performance. Any
change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated
programmers to discriminate against competing businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming
could adversely affect our ability to acquire programming at all or to acquire programming on a
cost-effective basis. We believe that the FCC generally has not shown a willingness to enforce the
program access rules aggressively. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access
(or nondiscriminatory access) to programming from programmers that are affiliated with the cable
system operators.

Affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to
their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. To the extent that cable operators
deliver additional programming terrestrially in the future, they may assert that this additional
programming is also exempt from the program access laws. These restrictions on our access to
programming could materially adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these
cable providers.

We depend on others to produce programming.

We depend on third parties to provide us with programming services. Our programming agreements
have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to ten years and contain various renewal and
cancellation provisions. We may not be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at
all, and these agreements may be canceled prior to expiration of their original term. If we are
unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties cancel the agreements, we cannot
assure you that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute
programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In addition,
programming costs may continue to increase. We may be unable to pass programming costs on to our
customers which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, profitability and
cash flows.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming, including
the Spanish-language programming previously discussed and foreign language programming distributed
over the Internet. There



can be no assurance that we will continue to experience growth in subscribers to our
foreign-language programming services. In addition, the increasing availability of foreign
language programming from our competitors, which in certain cases has resulted from our inability
to renew programming agreements on an exclusive basis or at all, could contribute to an increase in
our subscriber churn. Our agreements with distributors of foreign language programming have
varying expiration dates, and some agreements are on a month-to-month basis. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all.

We depend on independent retailers and others to solicit orders for DISH network services.

While we sell receiver systems and programming directly, independent distributors, direct
marketers, retailers and consumer electronics stores are responsible for most of our sales. We
also sell EchoStar receiver systems through nationwide retailers and certain regional consumer
electronic chains. If we are unable to continue our arrangements with these retailers, we cannot
guarantee that we would be able to obtain other sales agents, thus adversely affecting our
business.

We cannot assure you that there will not be deficiencies leading to material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting.

We periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This evaluation and testing of internal
control over financial reporting includes internal control over financial reporting relating to our
operations. Although our management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005, and while there has been no material change in our
internal control over financial reporting during 2006, if in the future we are unable to report
that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree
with our assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal
control over financial reporting), investors, customers and business partners could lose confidence
in the accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, we obtained feeds of distant broadcast network channels (ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX)
for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24. In December 1998, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami entered a nationwide permanent
injunction requiring PrimeTime 24 to shut off distant network channels to many of its customers,
and henceforth to sell those channels to consumers in accordance with the injunction.

In October 1998, we filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX in the United
States District Court for the District of Colorado. We asked the Court to find that our method of
providing distant network programming did not violate the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act
(“SHVIA”) and hence did not infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November 1998, the networks and
their affiliate association groups filed a complaint against
us in Miami Federal Court alleging,
among other things, copyright infringement. The Court combined the case that we filed in Colorado
with the case in Miami and transferred it to the Miami Federal Court.



In February 1999, the networks filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary
Injunction and Contempt Finding against DirecTV, Inc. in Miami related to the delivery of distant
network channels to DirecTV customers by satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the
networks. Under the terms of the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV
customers were scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels by
July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by December 31, 1999.
Subsequently, substantially all providers of satellite-delivered network programming other than us
agreed to this cut-off schedule, although we do not know if they adhered to this schedule.

In April 2002, we reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one of the plaintiffs in the
litigation, and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. In November 2002, we reached a private
settlement with NBC, another of the plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of
dismissal. During March 2004, we reached a private settlement with CBS, another of the plaintiffs
in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. We have also reached private
settlements with many independent stations and station groups. We were unable to reach a
settlement with five of the original eight plaintiffs — FOX and the independent affiliate groups
associated with each of the four networks.

A trial took place during April 2003 and the District Court issued a final judgment in June 2003.
The District Court found that with one exception our current distant network qualification
procedures comply with the law. We have revised our procedures to comply with the District Court’s
Order. Although the plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter an injunction precluding us from
selling any local or distant network programming, the District Court refused. While the plaintiffs
did not claim monetary damages and none were awarded, the plaintiffs were awarded approximately
$4.8 million in attorneys’ fees. This amount is substantially less than the amount the plaintiffs
sought. We asked the Court to reconsider the award and the Court has vacated the fee award. When
the award was vacated, the District Court also allowed us an opportunity to conduct discovery
concerning the amount of plaintiffs’ requested fees. The parties have agreed to postpone discovery
and an evidentiary hearing regarding attorneys’ fees until after the Court of Appeals rules on the
pending appeal of the Court’s June 2003 final judgment. It is not possible to make an assessment
of the probable outcome of plaintiffs’ outstanding request for fees.

The District Court’s injunction requires us to use a computer model to re-qualify, as of June 2003,
all of our subscribers who receive ABC, NBC, CBS or FOX programming by satellite from a market
other than the city in which the subscriber lives. The Court also invalidated all waivers
historically provided by network stations. These waivers, which have been provided by stations for
the past several years through a third party automated system, allow subscribers who believe the
computer model improperly disqualified them for distant network channels to nonetheless receive
those channels by satellite. Further, the District Court terminated the right of our grandfathered
subscribers to continue to receive distant network channels.

We believe the District Court made a number of errors and appealed the decision. Plaintiffs
cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals granted our request to stay the injunction until our appeal
is decided. Oral arguments occurred during February 2004. It is not possible to predict how or
when the Court of Appeals will rule on the merits of our appeal. On April 13, 2005, Plaintiffs
filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals to vacate the stay of the injunction that was issued in
August 2004. We responded on April 25, 2005. It is not possible to predict how or when the Court
of Appeals will rule on Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the stay.

In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the injunction or lifts the stay as plaintiffs now
request, and if we do not reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will
attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network channels, including
migration to local channels by satellite where available, and free off air antenna offers in other
markets. However, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many subscribers would cancel
their primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all subscribers in the
event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we are permanently enjoined from delivering
all distant network channels. Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would
result, among other things, in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in subscriber churn.



Superguide

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) filed suit against us, DirecTV and others in the
United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division,
alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,038,211 (the ‘211 patent), 5,293,357 (the ‘357
patent) and 4,751,578 (the ‘578 patent) which relate to certain electronic program guide functions,
including the use of electronic program guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and
declaratory relief and damages in an unspecified amount.

On summary judgment, the District Court ruled that none of the asserted patents were infringed by
us. These rulings were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
During February 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the District
Court’s findings and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. In July
2005, SuperGuide indicated that it would no longer pursue infringement allegations with respect to
the ‘211 and ‘357 patents and those patents have now been dismissed from the suit. We examined the
‘578 patent and believe that it is not infringed by any of our products or services. We will
continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we
infringe on any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble
damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly
electronic programming guide and related features that we currently offer to consumers. The case
is stayed pending the District Court’s ruling. A trial date has not been set. It is not possible
to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

In November of 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV, Thomson
Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the ‘066
patent). The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and receiving
data along with specific formatting information for the data. The ‘066 patent relates to certain
methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on removable
cards. We examined these patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or
services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving us as the
only defendant.

During January 2004, the judge issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid. In August of 2004,
the Court ruled the ‘094 invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter
and Comcast. In August of 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(“CAFC”) overturned this finding of invalidity and remanded the case back to the District Court.
Charter has filed a petition for rehearing and the CAFC has asked Broadcom to respond to the
petition. Our case remains stayed pending resolution of the Charter case. We intend to continue
to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe
on any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages
and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that
we currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome
of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

TiVo Inc.

During January 2004, TiVo Inc. (“TiVo”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent No.
6,233,389 (the ‘389 patent). The ‘389 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing
what the patent calls “time-warping.” We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is
infringed by any of our products or services. During March 2005, the Court denied our motion to
transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
The trial is scheduled to commence on March 27, 2006 in Marshall, Texas. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we
may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that
could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to
consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the suit or to
determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.



On April 29, 2005, we filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Texas against TiVo and Humax USA, Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,774,186 (the
‘186 patent), 6,529,685 (the ‘685 patent), 6,208,804 (the ‘804 patent) and 6,173,112 (the ‘112
patent). These patents relate to digital video recorder (“DVR”) technology. Trial is currently
scheduled for February 2007.

Acacia

In June 2004, Acacia Media Technologies filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California. The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast, Charter, Cox
and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants. Acacia is an intellectual property holding
company which seeks to license the patent portfolio that it has acquired. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992 (the ‘992 patent), 5,253,275 (the ‘275 patent),
5,550,863 (the ‘863 patent), 6,002,720 (the ‘720 patent) and 6,144,702 (the ‘702 patent). The
‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘702 patents have been asserted against us.

The asserted patents relate to various systems and methods related to the transmission of digital
data. The ‘992 and ‘702 patents have also been asserted against several internet adult content
providers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On July 12,
2004, that Court issued a Markman ruling which found that the ‘992 and ‘702 patents were not as
broad as Acacia had contended.

Acacia’s various patent infringement cases have now been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the
United States District court for the Northern District of California. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe on any of the
patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of
the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Forgent

In July of 2005, Forgent Networks, Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit also named DirecTV, Charter, Comcast, Time
Warner Cable, Cable One and Cox as defendants. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent No. 6,285,746 (the ‘746 patent).

The ‘746 patent discloses a video teleconferencing system which utilizes digital telephone lines.
We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. Trial is currently scheduled for February 2007 in Marshall, Texas. We intend to
vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this
patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of
the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

California Action

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal clear digital video,”
“CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and with respect to the number of channels
available in various programming packages was filed against us in the California State Superior
Court for Los Angeles County in 1999 by David Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit
unincorporated association. The claim was denied class certification. In December 2005, we
reached a settlement for an immaterial amount with the individual plaintiffs.

Retailer Class Actions

During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed by retailers in the Arapahoe County District
Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District Court for the District of Colorado,
respectively, by Air Communication & Satellite, Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of
themselves and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify
nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The plaintiffs are
requesting the Courts to declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged agreements between
us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and
payments, charge backs, and other



compensation. We are vigorously defending against the suits and have asserted a variety of
counterclaims. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado stayed the Federal
Court action to allow the parties to pursue a comprehensive adjudication of their dispute in the
Arapahoe County State Court. John DeJong, d/b/a Nexwave, and Joseph Kelley, d/b/a Keltronics,
subsequently intervened in the Arapahoe County Court action as plaintiffs and proposed class
representatives. We have filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts and against all
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a motion for additional time to conduct discovery to enable them
to respond to our motion. The Court granted a limited discovery period which ended November 15,
2004. The Court is hearing discovery related motions and has set a briefing schedule for the
motion for summary judgment to begin 30 days after the ruling on those motions. A trial date has
not been set. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation
or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment Complaint

During October 2001, EchoStar received approximately $40.0 million from the sale of Enron
commercial paper to a third party broker. That commercial paper was ultimately purchased by Enron.
During November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York, against approximately 100 defendants, including us, who invested in
Enron’s commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 purchase of its
commercial paper was a fraudulent conveyance and voidable preference under bankruptcy laws. We
dispute these allegations. We typically invest in commercial paper and notes which are rated in
one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations. At the time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was considered to be
high quality and considered to be a very low risk. The defendants moved the Court to dismiss the
case on grounds that Enron’s complaint does not adequately state a legal claim, which motion was
denied but is subject to an appeal. It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome
of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Bank One

During March 2004, Bank One, N.A. (“Bank One”) filed suit against us and one of our subsidiaries,
EchoStar Acceptance Corporation (“EAC”), in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio
alleging breach of a duty to indemnify. Bank One alleges that EAC is contractually required to
indemnify Bank One for a settlement it paid to consumers who entered private label credit card
agreements with Bank One to purchase satellite equipment in the late 1990s. Bank One alleges that
we entered into a guarantee wherein we agreed to pay any indemnity obligation incurred by Bank One.
During April 2004, we removed the case to federal court in Columbus, Ohio. We deny the
allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We filed a motion to dismiss the
Complaint which was granted in part and denied in part. The Court granted our motion, agreeing we
did not owe Bank One a duty to defend the underlying lawsuit. However, the Court denied the motion
in that Bank One will be allowed to attempt to prove that we owed Bank One a duty to indemnify.
The case is currently in discovery. A trial date has not been set. It is too early in the
litigation to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Church Communications Network, Inc.

During August 2004, Church Communications Network, Inc. (“CCN”) filed suit against us in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, asserting causes of action for breach
of contract, negligent misrepresentation, intentional and reckless misrepresentation, and
non-disclosure based on a 2003 contract with us. The action was transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of Colorado. The Court permitted CCN to amend its complaint to
assert the same claims based on a 2000 contract with us. We have filed motions for summary
judgment on all claims in the case. CCN has filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of
liability on its intentional and reckless misrepresentation claim. CCN claims approximately $20.0
million in damages plus punitive damages, attorney fees and costs. Discovery has been concluded
but no trial date has been set. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome
of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.



Vivendi

In January 2005, Vivendi Universal, S.A. (“Vivendi”), filed suit against us in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that we have anticipatorily
repudiated or are in breach of an alleged agreement between us and Vivendi pursuant to which we are
allegedly required to broadcast a music-video channel provided by Vivendi. Vivendi’s complaint
seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, and damages in an unspecified amount. On April 12, 2005,
the Court granted Vivendi’s motion for a preliminary injunction and directed us to broadcast the
music-video channel during the pendency of the litigation. In connection with that order, we have
also agreed to provide marketing support to Vivendi during the pendency of the litigation. In the
event that the Court ultimately determines that we have a contractual obligation to broadcast the
Vivendi music-video channel and that we are in breach of that obligation, we may be required to
continue broadcasting the Vivendi music-video channel and may also be subject to substantial
damages. We intend to vigorously defend this case.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

During March 2005, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against EchoStar, its chairman and
chief executive officer Charles W. Ergen and the members of its board of directors in the District
Court of Douglas County, Colorado. On November 7, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Dismissal
asking that the suit be dismissed without prejudice.

Other

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability
with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

As of March 8, 2006, there were approximately 17,779 holders of record of our Class A common
stock, not including stockholders who beneficially own Class A common stock held in nominee or
street name. As of March 8, 2006, 188,435,208 of the 238,435,208 outstanding shares of our Class
B common stock were held by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. During
the fourth quarter of 2005, the remaining 50,000,000 outstanding shares of Class B common stock
were gifted to a trust for members of Mr. Ergen’s family. There is currently no trading market
for our Class B common stock.

Dividend.

On December 14, 2004, we paid a one-time cash dividend of $1.00 per share, or
approximately $455.7 million, on outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock to
shareholders of record at the close of business on December 8, 2004.

We currently do not intend to declare additional dividends on our common stock. Payment of any
future dividends will depend upon our earnings and capital requirements, restrictions in our debt
facilities, and other factors the Board of Directors considers appropriate. We currently intend to
retain our earnings, if any, to support future growth and expansion. See “Item 7. — Management’s

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our strategy for 2006 will continue to focus on improving our operating results and free cash flow
by attempting to increase our subscriber base, reduce churn, control rising subscriber acquisition
costs and maintain or improve operating margins. We will also continue to focus on improving our
competitive position by leveraging our increased satellite capacity to pursue strategic initiatives
and new technology. In addition, we may make investments in or partner with others to expand our
business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services.

Operational Results and Goals

Increase our subscriber base and reduce churn.

We added approximately 1.135 million net new
subscribers during 2005, ending the year with approximately 12.040 million DISH Network
subscribers. We intend to continue growing our subscriber base by offering compelling consumer
promotions. These promotions include offers of free or low cost advanced consumer electronics
products, such as DVRs and HD receivers, as well as various promotional offers of our DISH Network
programming packages, which we believe generally have a better “price-to-value” relationship than
packages currently offered by most other subscription television providers.

However, there are many reasons we may not be able to maintain our current rate of new subscriber
growth. For example, our subscriber growth would decrease if our telecommunications partners and
other distributors de-emphasize or discontinue their efforts to acquire DISH network subscribers,
or if they begin offering non-DISH Network video services. Our subscriber growth would also be
negatively impacted to the extent our competitors offer more attractive consumer promotions,
including, among other things, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more
compelling consumer electronic products and services, including advanced DVRs, VOD services, and HD
television services, including HD local channels. Many of our competitors are also better equipped
than we are to offer video services bundled with other telecommunications services such as
telephone and broadband data services, including wireless services. We also expect to face
increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to
consumers over the internet.

In order to increase our subscriber base we must control our rate of customer turnover, or “churn.”
Our percentage monthly churn for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 1.65%,
compared to our percentage churn for 2004 of approximately 1.62%. Our principal strategy to
control churn is to maintain disciplined credit requirements, such as requiring new subscribers to
provide a valid major credit card, their social security number and have an acceptable credit
score, and tailor our promotions toward subscribers desiring multiple receivers and advanced
products such as DVRs and HD receivers. We also plan to continue to offer advanced products to
existing customers through our lease promotions and to initiate other programs to improve our
overall subscriber retention. However, there can be no assurance that these and other actions we
may take to control subscriber churn will be successful, and we will be unable to continue to grow
our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn.

We also continue to undertake initiatives with respect to our conditional access system to improve
the security of the DISH Network signal and attempt to make theft of our programming commercially
impractical or uneconomical. However, theft of service and many other factors may have a material
adverse impact on our subscriber churn.

Control rising subscriber acquisition costs.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally
subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to
attract new DISH Network subscribers. Consequently, we cannot fully recover the acquisition costs
of subscribers who remain customers for relatively short periods of time. Our principal strategies
to control rising subscriber acquisition costs involve reducing the overall cost of subsidized
equipment we provide to new customers and improving the cost effectiveness of our sales efforts.
Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment is to lease our receiver systems
to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Leasing enables us
to, among other things, reduce our future subscriber acquisition costs by redeploying equipment
returned by disconnected lease subscribers. We are further reducing the cost of subscriber
equipment through our design and deployment of EchoStar receivers with
multiple tuners that allow the subscriber to receive our DISH Network services in multiple rooms
using a single set-top box, thereby reducing the number of EchoStar receivers we deploy to each
subscriber household. However, our overall subscriber acquisition costs, including amounts
expensed and capitalized, both in the aggregate and on a per



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

new subscriber basis, may materially
increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions or newer, more
expensive consumer electronics products in response to new promotions and products offered by our
competitors or for other reasons. In addition, expanded use of new compression technologies, such
as MPEG-4 and 8PSK, will inevitably render some portion of our current and future EchoStar
receivers obsolete, and we will incur additional costs, which may be substantial, to upgrade or
replace these set-top boxes.

Maintain or improve operating margins.

We will continue to work to generate cost savings during
2006 by attempting to improve our operating efficiency and to control rising programming costs. We
are attempting to control costs by improving the quality of the initial installation, providing
better subscriber education in the use of our products and services, and enhancing our training
programs for our in-home service and call center representatives. However, these initiatives may
not be sufficient to maintain or increase our operational efficiencies and we may not be able to
continue to grow our operations cost effectively.

Our operating margins have also been adversely impacted by rising programming costs. Payments we
make to programmers for programming content represent one of the largest components of our
operating costs. We expect programming providers to continue to demand higher rates for their
programming. We will continue to negotiate aggressively with programming providers in an effort to
control rising programming costs. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful in
controlling these costs, and we may be forced to drop one or more channels if we cannot reach
acceptable agreements with all of our content providers. In addition, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to increase the price of our programming to offset programming rate increases
without affecting the attractiveness of our programming packages.

Leverage increased satellite capacity

. We have recently entered into agreements to purchase or
lease a substantial amount of additional satellite capacity. We are currently evaluating various
opportunities to utilize this capacity, including, but not limited to, launching satellite two-way
and wireless broadband data services, increasing our international programming and expanding our HD
programming, including HD local channels. However, we face a variety of risks and uncertainties
that may prevent us from utilizing this additional satellite capacity profitably. These risks
include, among other things, the risks that there may be insufficient market demand for these new
services and program offerings, or that customers might find competing services and program
offerings more attractive. In addition, many of these new services depend on successful
development of new technologies which may not perform as we expect. Our results of operation and
financial condition will be adversely affected if we cannot make profitable use of this additional
satellite capacity.

New technology.

We continue to explore new advanced products and services that we may offer in
order to improve our overall subscriber retention and grow our subscriber base. These new products
and services include, among other things, our recently released hand-held products, such as our
PocketDish, as well as new VOD service alternatives and HD programming. In addition, we may expand
our business to include mobile and portable video, data and voice services, among other things.

However, there can be no assurance new products or services we may develop and offer to our
subscribers will be successful in competing with similar products and services offered by our
competitors. For example, some digital cable platforms currently offer a VOD service that enables
subscribers to choose from a library of programming selections for viewing at their convenience.
Our own VOD service alternative, which was launched on a limited scale during 2005, is still under
development. Also, although we believe we currently offer more HD content than our competitors, we
may be placed at a competitive disadvantage to the extent other multi-channel video providers
increase their offering of HD programming. We could be further disadvantaged to the extent a
significant number of local broadcasters begin offering local channels in HD, unless we make
substantial additional investments in infrastructure to deliver HD programming. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with VOD service and HD program offerings
from other video providers.

Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items

Subscriber-related revenue

.

“Subscriber-related revenue” consists principally of revenue from
basic, movie, local, international and pay-per-view subscription television services, advertising
sales, DVR fees, equipment rental fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple
set-top boxes and other subscriber revenue. Contemporaneous with the commencement of sales of
co-branded services pursuant to our agreement with AT&T during the first quarter



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

of 2004,
“Subscriber-related revenue” also includes revenue from equipment sales, installation and other
services related to that agreement. Revenue from equipment sales to AT&T is deferred and
recognized over the estimated average co-branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and
certain other services performed at the request of AT&T is recognized upon completion of the
services.

Development and implementation fees received from AT&T are being recognized in “Subscriber-related
revenue” over the next several years. In order to estimate the amount recognized monthly, we first
divide the number of subscribers activated during the month under the AT&T agreement by total
estimated subscriber activations during the life of the contract. We then multiply this percentage
by the total development and implementation fees received from AT&T. The resulting estimated
monthly amount is recognized as revenue over the estimated average subscriber life.

During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency
agreement with AT&T. We believe our overall economic return will be similar under both
arrangements. However, the impact of subscriber acquisition on many of our line item business
metrics was substantially different under the prior AT&T agreement, compared to most other sales
channels (including the revised AT&T agreement).

Among other things, our “Subscriber-related revenue” will be impacted in a number of respects.
Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our AT&T agreement do not
generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue. However, our programming
services revenue will be greater for subscribers acquired under the revised AT&T agreement.

Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our prior AT&T agreement
will continue to have a positive impact on “Subscriber-related revenue” over the estimated average
life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from AT&T will
continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired
under both the previous and revised agreements with AT&T.

Effective January 1, 2004, we combined “Subscription television service” revenue and “Other
subscriber-related revenue” into “Subscriber-related revenue.” All prior period amounts were
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Equipment sales

.

“Equipment sales” consist of sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and
related components by our ETC subsidiary to an international DBS service provider and by our
EchoStar International Corporation (“EIC”) subsidiary to international customers. “Equipment
sales” also include unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of
our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. “Equipment sales” does not include
revenue from sales of equipment to AT&T.

Effective January 1, 2004, “Equipment sales” includes non-DISH Network receivers and other
accessories sold by our EIC subsidiary to international customers which were previously included in
“Other” revenue. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

“Other” sales.

“Other” sales consist principally of revenues from subscription and satellite
services from the C-band subscription television service business of Superstar/Netlink Group L.L.C.
(“SNG”) that we acquired in April 2004 and satellite transmission revenue.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” principally include programming
expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations,
overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, residual commissions
paid to retailers or distributors, billing, lockbox, subscriber retention and other variable
subscriber expenses. Contemporaneous with the commencement of sales of co-branded services
pursuant to our agreement with AT&T during the first quarter of 2004, “Subscriber-related expenses”
also include the cost of sales from equipment sales, and expenses related to installation and other
services from that relationship. Cost of sales from equipment sales to AT&T are deferred and
recognized over the estimated
average co-branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services
performed at the request of AT&T are recognized as the services are performed.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Under the revised AT&T agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in
“Subscriber acquisition costs” or in capital expenditures, rather than in “Subscriber-related
expenses.” To the extent all other factors remain constant, this will tend to improve operating
margins compared to previous periods. We will continue to include in “Subscriber-related expenses”
the costs deferred from equipment sales made to AT&T. These costs are being amortized over the
life of the subscribers acquired under the previous AT&T agreement.

Since equipment and installation costs previously reflected in “Subscriber-related expenses” are
being included in “Subscriber acquisition costs” or in capital expenditures under the revised
agreement, to the extent all other factors remain constant, the revised AT&T agreement will also
cause increases in “Subscriber acquisition costs,” SAC and Equivalent SAC. This will tend to
negatively impact free cash flow in the short term if substantial additional subscribers are added
through AT&T in the future, but we believe that free cash flow will improve over time since better
operating margins are expected from those customers under the terms of the revised AT&T agreement.
We also expect that the historical negative impact on subscriber turnover from subscribers acquired
pursuant to our agreement with AT&T will decline.

Satellite and transmission expenses

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses” include costs
associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels,
satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other
related services.

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” principally includes costs associated with
non-DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold by our ETC subsidiary to an
international DBS service provider and by our EIC subsidiary to international customers. “Cost of
sales – equipment” also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other
distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. “Cost of sales –
equipment” does not include the costs from sales of equipment to AT&T.

Effective January 1, 2004, “Cost of sales – equipment” includes non-DISH Network receivers and
other accessories sold by our EIC subsidiary to international customers which were previously
included in “Cost of sales – other.” All prior period amounts conform to the current period
presentation.

Cost of sales – other.

“Cost of sales – other” principally includes costs related to satellite
transmission services and programming and other expenses associated with the C-band subscription
television service business of SNG we acquired in April 2004.

Subscriber acquisition costs

.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize
installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new
DISH Network subscribers. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” include the cost of EchoStar receiver
systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems
sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs
related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized
under our lease program for new subscribers from “Subscriber acquisition costs.” We also exclude
payments we receive in connection with equipment that is not returned to us from disconnecting
lease subscribers, and the value of equipment returned to the extent we make that equipment
available for sale rather than redeploying it through the lease program from our calculation of
“Subscriber acquisition costs.”

Since equipment and installation costs previously reflected in “Subscriber-related expenses” are
being included in “Subscriber acquisition costs” or in capital expenditures under the revised
agreement, to the extent all other factors remain constant, the revised AT&T agreement will also
cause increases in “Subscriber acquisition costs,” SAC and Equivalent SAC. This will tend to
negatively impact free cash flow in the short term if substantial additional subscribers are added
through AT&T in the future, but we believe that free cash flow will improve over time since better
operating margins are expected from those customers under the terms of the revised AT&T agreement.
We also expect that the historical negative impact on subscriber turnover from subscribers acquired
pursuant to our agreement with AT&T will decline.

SAC and Equivalent SAC.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating “subscriber
acquisition costs per new subscriber activation,” or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may
not be calculated consistently by
different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers
in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber
acquisition costs. Historically and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have calculated SAC by
dividing the amount of our expense line item “Subscriber acquisition costs” for a period, by our
gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we have disclosed our
“Equivalent SAC” by adding certain capital expenditures and
other amounts, as discussed below, to
our “Subscriber acquisition cost” expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber
number.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Effective January 1, 2006, we will disclose only the combined “Equivalent SAC” number, which we
will simply refer to as SAC. To calculate SAC (previously “Equivalent SAC”) we add the value of
equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers to the expense line item
“Subscriber acquisition costs,” subtract certain offsetting amounts, and divide the result by our
gross new subscriber number. These offsetting amounts include payments we receive in connection
with equipment that is not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers, and the value of
equipment returned to the extent we make that equipment available for sale rather than redeploying
it through the lease program.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses” primarily include
employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems,
accounting and finance. It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting
services) and building maintenance expense and other items associated with administration.

Interest expense.

“Interest expense” primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and
amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated
debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital
lease obligations.

“Other” income (expense).

The main components of “Other” income and expense are unrealized gains
and losses from changes in fair value of non-marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair
value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of
investments, and impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)

. EBITDA is defined as
“Net income (loss)” plus “Interest expense” net of “Interest income,” “Taxes” and “Depreciation and
amortization.”

DISH Network subscribers.

We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our
retail networks, including our co-branding relationship with AT&T and other distribution
relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for
co-branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to
hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide
our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail
price of our most widely distributed programming package, AT60 (but taking into account,
periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is
substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network
subscriber count.

During April 2004, we acquired the C-band subscription television service business of SNG, the
assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting
some of these customer relationships from C-band subscription television services to our DISH
Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C-band subscribers are not included in our
DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television
service.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber (“ARPU”)

.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for
calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other
companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber,
or ARPU, by dividing average monthly “Subscriber-related revenues” for the period (total
“Subscriber-related revenue” during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by
our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are
calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and
dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month
are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and
dividing by two.

The changes to our agreement with AT&T will also impact ARPU. The magnitude of that impact, and
whether ARPU increases or decreases during particular future periods, will depend on the timing and
number of subscribers acquired pursuant to the modified agreement with AT&T.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

As discussed in “Subscriber-related revenue” above, effective January 1, 2004 we include amounts
previously reported as “Other subscriber-related revenue” in our ARPU calculation. All prior
period amounts conform to the current period presentation.

Subscriber churn/subscriber turnover

.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating
subscriber churn and believe presentations of subscriber churn may not be calculated consistently
by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly
subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during
each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate
average subscriber churn for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who
terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to
churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH
Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network
subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of
months in the period.

Free cash flow

.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less
“Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

DISH Network subscribers

.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH
Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an
increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new
subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new
subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in
gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co-branding
agreement with AT&T, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and
an increase in our other distribution channels. A substantial majority of our gross new subscriber
additions are acquired through our equipment lease program.

DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of
approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a
larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our
co-branding agreement with AT&T. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained
constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net
subscriber growth.

During the first half of 2005, AT&T shifted its DISH Network marketing and sales efforts to focus
on limited geographic areas and customer segments. As a result of AT&T’s de-emphasized sales of
DISH Network services, a decreasing percentage of our new subscriber additions were derived from
our relationship with AT&T. During fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution
and sales agency agreement with AT&T and we now bear the cost of equipment and installation costs
associated with subscriber acquisitions under the revised agreement. We believe our overall per
subscriber economic return will be similar under both arrangements.

While we expect to continue to pursue opportunities for AT&T and other telecommunications providers
to bundle our DISH Network satellite television service with their voice and data services, AT&T
has begun deployment of fiber-optic networks that will allow it to offer video services directly to
millions of homes as early as the second half of 2006. Other telecommunications companies have
announced similar plans. While it is possible that the fourth quarter 2005 revision to our AT&T
agreement may drive increased subscriber growth, our net new subscriber additions and certain of
our other key operating metrics could continue to be adversely affected to the extent AT&T further
de-emphasizes, or discontinues altogether, its efforts to acquire DISH Network subscribers, and as
a result of competition from video services offered by AT&T or other telecommunications companies.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing significant new
bundling opportunities with other telecommunications companies.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we began test marketing a prepay program, “DISH Now.” This
program allows consumers who might not be attracted by our existing promotions to purchase a
satellite receiver system and a prepaid card which can be refreshed periodically through additional
prepayments. We have not yet determined whether this program will be offered broadly. Certain of
our business metrics could be impacted to the extent we ultimately acquire a significant number of
subscribers through “DISH Now.” For example, while “DISH Now” may attract subscribers more likely
to churn than our traditional customers, our subscriber acquisition costs under this program will
also be substantially lower.

Our net new subscriber additions would also be negatively impacted to the extent existing or new
competitors offer more attractive consumer promotions, including, among other things, better priced
or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and
services, including advanced DVRs, VOD services, and HD television services or additional local
channels. Many of our competitors are also better equipped than we are to offer video services
bundled with other telecommunications services such as telephone and broadband data services,
including wireless services. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other
providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the internet.

Subscriber-related revenue.

DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $7.955 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.277 billion or 19.1% compared to 2004. This
increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in
“ARPU” discussed below.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

ARPU

. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately $57.81 during the year ended
December 31, 2005 and approximately $54.87 during 2004. The $2.94 or 5.4% increase in monthly
average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our
most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our
equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This
increase was also attributable to our relationship with AT&T, including revenues from equipment
sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were
partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided
local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of
December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which
provide free and/or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU.

Effective February 2004, our DHA promotion provided new lease subscribers up to four installed
EchoStar receivers, including various premium models, with a qualifying programming subscription.
The subscriber was required to pay a monthly rental fee for each leased receiver and a one-time
set-up fee of $49.99, but was not required to agree to a minimum lease period. The subscriber
received a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill. Effective October 2004, the promotion was
expanded whereby the consumer may agree to either a one or two year commitment in exchange for
receiving the benefits of our Digital Home Protection Plan, an optional extended warranty program,
without charge for one or two years, respectively. In February 2005, the promotion was modified to
allow new residential customers who subscribed to “America’s Top 180” to obtain that programming at
the same price as “America’s Top 120” for the first three months. This promotion expired during
April 2005.

During May 2005, we introduced a promotion which offers new DHA lease program subscribers our
“America’s Top 180” package for $19.99 for each of the first three months of service. Effective
June 2005, the promotion was modified to provide a $12.00 discount per month on qualifying
programming packages, together with free HBO and Showtime programming, for each of the first three
months of service. The promotion, which continued through August 15, 2005, required a one year
minimum programming commitment.

During August 2005, we introduced a promotion which offers new DHA lease program subscribers a free
month of qualifying programming, three free months of HBO, Showtime and Cinemax programming, and a
free DVR upgrade. Further, in exchange for an 18 month minimum programming commitment, new lease
program subscribers receive a credit of the one-time set-up fee of $49.99. Effective November 3,
2005, instead of one month free, new lease program subscribers can elect to receive a $12.00
discount for the first three months of service on qualifying programming. These promotions expired
January 31, 2006.

Effective February 1, 2006, we introduced a promotion which offers $100 back to new DHA lease
program subscribers that activate with at least “America’s Top 120,” “DISH Latino Max,” “DishHD
Silver,” or higher qualified programming package. After the first month’s bill, a credit of $10
per month will be provided for 10 consecutive months after a redemption form has been submitted by
the new subscriber. At any time during that period, the remaining credits will be forfeited if the
service is (1) downgraded below the required level, (2) put on-hold or (3) cancelled for any
reason. In addition, these subscribers and other new customers that subscribe to at least the
minimum qualified programming such as “America’s Top 60” “DISH Latino,” “DishHD Bronze,” or higher
qualified programming package are eligible to receive Starz programming free for three months.
These promotions are expected to continue through at least June 30, 2006.

Effective February 1, 2006, we introduced a new programming tier, DishFAMILY, which offers 40
“family- friendly” channels including sports, news, children’s programming, lifestyle, hobbies,
shopping and public interest for $19.99 per month, or $24.99 including local channels where
available.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing the delivery of
superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate delivery of network channels and
superstations to a substantial number of our subscribers, which could cause many of those customers
to cancel their subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the
Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not reach private settlement
agreements with additional stations, we will attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative
means to receive network channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where
available, and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict with any
degree of certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their primary DISH Network
programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network
programming to all subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail
on their cross-appeal and we permanently enjoined from delivering all
distant network channels. Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result in, among other
things, a reduction in ARPU and a temporary increase in subscriber churn.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Equipment sales

.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, “Equipment sales” totaled $377.9 million,
an increase of $4.7 million or 1.3% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase
principally resulted from an increase in sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and related
components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS
accessories domestically.

“Other” sales.

“Other” sales totaled $92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a
decrease of $7.8 million compared to the same period during 2004. This decrease is primarily
attributable to a decline in the subscription television service revenues from C-band subscribers
of the SNG business that we acquired in April 2004, partially offset by an increase in our
satellite transmission revenue.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $4.031 billion during the year
ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $463.2 million or 13.0% compared to 2004. The increase in
“Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH
Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network, partially
offset by a $35.1 million non-recurring vendor credit. “Subscriber-related expenses” represented
50.7% and 53.4% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase
in “Subscriber-related revenue,” the vendor credit discussed above, and an increase in the number
of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since
certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than
expensed, our “Subscriber-related expenses” decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The
decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and
in-home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by
increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related
to our relationship under our prior agreement with AT&T. The decrease in the ratio was also
partially offset by approximately $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for
the replacement of smart cards.

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide
content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of
subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses
will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In
addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, there can be no assurance
that our “Subscriber-related expenses” as a percentage of “Subscriber-related revenue” will not
materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages.

Satellite and transmission expenses

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled $134.5 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004.
This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with
the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as
previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC-2, and
operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC-15 and AMC-16 which commenced
commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. “Satellite and transmission
expenses” totaled 1.7% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during each of the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our
satellite fleet, if we obtain in-orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and
operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming
services are launched.

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” totaled $323.1 million during the year
ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $17.8 million or 5.8% compared to 2004. This increase
related primarily to the increase in sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and related
components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete
inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in
sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase.
“Cost of sales – equipment” represented 85.5% and 81.8% of “Equipment sales,” during the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio
principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and
on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005
charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Cost of sales – other.

“Cost of sales – other” totaled $23.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2005, a decrease of $9.9 million or 29.8% compared to 2004. This decrease is
primarily attributable to expenses associated with the C-band subscription television service
business of SNG we acquired in April 2004.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled approximately $1.493 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The
decrease in “Subscriber acquisition costs” was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network
subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by
an increase in the number of non co-branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition
advertising.

SAC and Equivalent SAC.

Subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH Network subscriber activation
were approximately $439 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and approximately $444 during 2004.
The $5, or 1.1% decrease in SAC was primarily attributable to a greater number of DISH Network
subscribers participating in our equipment lease program. This improvement was partially offset by
a decrease in the percentage of co-branded subscribers acquired compared to total subscribers
acquired and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced
products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs, HD receivers and SuperDISH. Activation of
these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as
compared to 2004. The decrease in SAC was also offset by the higher costs for acquisition
advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network.

Equivalent SAC was approximately $668 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $593
during 2004, an increase of $75, or 12.6%. This increase was primarily attributable to a greater
number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers
with multiple tuners, DVRs, HD receivers and SuperDISH. Activation of these more advanced and
complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The
increase in Equivalent SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and
promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease
program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment
capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and
$574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease
rather than purchase equipment continued to increase compared to 2004. The increase in leased
equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to
increase, while our “Subscriber acquisition costs” and SAC declined.

The increase in capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers
has been, and we expect it will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the
redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain
competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology
changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render
existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the Equivalent SAC reduction associated
with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.

Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation
technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost
to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than
if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK
technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming
channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the
acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we
add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and
create additional revenue opportunities. We have implemented MPEG-4 technology in all satellite
receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology when
implemented will result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined
the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the
period of time over which the conversions will occur. Provided EchoStar X commences commercial
operation during second quarter 2006 and other planned satellites are successfully deployed, our
8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise
required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG-4.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of
equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in
the short term. To the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers, SAC,
Equivalent SAC and capital expenditures will increase as well. However, the increases in these
costs would be mitigated by, among other things, our expected migration away from relatively
expensive and complex SuperDISH installations (assuming successful commencement of commercial
operation of our EchoStar X satellite and the continued availability of our other in-orbit
satellites). These increases may also be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing
set-top boxes and implement other SAC reduction strategies.

Our “Subscriber acquisition costs,” both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis,
may further materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive
promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons.
See further discussion under “

Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subscriber Retention and
Acquisition Costs.”

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses” totaled $456.2 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004.
The increase in “General and administrative expenses” was primarily attributable to increased
personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. “General and
administrative expenses” represented 5.4% and 5.6% of “Total revenue” during the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted
primarily from “Total revenue” increasing at a higher rate than our “General and administrative
expenses.”

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $797.9 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $295.0 million or 58.7% compared to 2004.
The increase in “Depreciation and amortization” expense was primarily attributable to additional
depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our
equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH
Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites, which commenced commercial
operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized

.

“Interest expense” totaled $373.8 million during the
year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This
decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write-off of debt issuance
costs totaling approximately $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of
approximately $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our
previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset
by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease
obligations for the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites.

Gain on insurance settlement.

During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims
for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net
amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0
million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a “Gain on insurance
settlement” during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Other.

“Other” income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
“Other” expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted
from an approximate $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non-marketable
strategic investment accounted for at fair value and approximately $28.4 million in gains related
to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005.
These gains were partially offset by an approximate $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than
temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company
in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

. EBITDA was $2.135 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $942.6 million or 79.0% compared to $1.193 billion
during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating
revenues and expenses discussed above. EBITDA does not include the impact of capital expenditures
under our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs of approximately $982.8 million and
$654.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net
income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of
operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure
for those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video programming distribution industry.
Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to
service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Income
tax benefit (provision), net.

Our income tax benefit was
$507.4 million during the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This
decrease was primarily related to an approximate $592.8 million credit to our provision for income
taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred
tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realizable (see Note 6 in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). During 2006,
we expect our income tax provision to approximate statutory Federal and state tax rates.

Net income (loss).

“Net income” was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an
increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily
attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher
“Operating income,” the “Gain on insurance settlement” and lower “Interest expense, net of amounts
capitalized.”

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered
by satellite to any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8,
2006. We currently offer local broadcast channels in 164 markets across the
United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish was previously required to
receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently reduced
the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely
eliminate the second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of
EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity
limitations could force us to move the local channels in some two dish markets
to different satellites, requiring subscribers in those markets to install a
second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast channels.
We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of
those markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a
market to a single dish could result in disruptions of service for a substantial
number of our customers. Further, our ability to timely comply with this
requirement without incurring significant additional costs is dependent on,
among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite at the
129 degree orbital location until commencement of commercial operation of
EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X anomalies could force us to cease offering
local channels by satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the
single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition plan arise,
it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement
could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent subscribers are unwilling for any
reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be negatively
impacted.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

In addition, we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets
at least until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the
event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but
not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites. The potential relocation of some
channels, and elimination of others, resulting from failures relating to EchoStar X or EchoStar
VIII, could cause a material adverse impact on our business, including, among other things, a
reduction in revenues, an increase in operating expenses, a decrease in new subscriber activations
and an increase in subscriber churn.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

DISH Network subscribers

.

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 10.905 million DISH
Network subscribers compared to approximately 9.425 million at December 31, 2003, an increase of
approximately 15.7%. DISH Network added approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers for the
year ended December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 2.894 million gross new subscribers during
2003, an increase of approximately 547,000 gross new subscribers. The increase in gross new
subscribers resulted from a number of factors, including the commencement of sales under our
co-branding agreement with AT&T and other distribution relationships and an increase in our
distribution channels. Temporary product shortages and installation delays during the second half
of 2003 were substantially eliminated during the first quarter of 2004 which also contributed to
the current year increase.

DISH Network added approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31,
2004 compared to approximately 1.245 million net new subscribers during 2003, an increase of
approximately 18.9%. The increase in net new subscribers resulted from the factors discussed
above.

Subscriber-related revenue

. DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $6.677 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.267 billion or 23.4% compared to 2003. This
increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in
“ARPU” discussed below.

ARPU

. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately $54.87 during the year ended
December 31, 2004 and approximately $51.21 during 2003. The $3.66 or 7.1% increase in monthly
average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases of up to
$2.00 in February 2004 and 2003 on some of our most popular packages, and from equipment sales,
installation and other services related to our relationship with AT&T. This increase was also
attributable to a reduction in the number of DISH Network subscribers receiving subsidized
programming through our free and discounted programming promotions, the increased availability of
local channels by satellite, increases in our advertising sales and increases in the number of DISH
Network subscribers with multiple set-top boxes and DVRs. We provided local channels by satellite
in 152 markets as of December 31, 2004 compared to 101 markets as of December 31, 2003.

Equipment sales

.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, “Equipment sales” totaled $373.3 million,
an increase of $77.8 million or 26.4% compared to the same period during 2003. This increase
principally resulted from an increase in sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other
distributors of our equipment domestically and directly to DISH Network subscribers.

“Other” sales.

“Other” sales totaled $100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an
increase of $66.6 million compared to the same period during 2003. This increase is primarily
attributable to the subscription television service revenues from C-band subscribers of the SNG
business that we acquired in April 2004.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $3.567 billion during the year
ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $859.5 million or 31.7% compared to 2003. The increase in
“Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH
Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network.
“Subscriber-related expenses” represented 53.4% and 50.1% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in this expense to revenue
ratio primarily resulted from increases in our programming and subscriber retention costs, and
costs associated with the expansion of our installation, in-home service and call center
operations. These increased operational costs, some of which are temporary, related to, among
other things, more complicated installations required by receivers with multiple tuners and a
larger dish, or “SuperDISH” which is used to receive programming from our FSS satellites. The
increase also resulted from cost of sales and expenses from equipment sales, installation and other
services related to our relationship with AT&T.

Satellite and transmission expenses

. “Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled $112.2 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $32.9 million or 41.5% compared to 2003.
This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with
the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as
previously discussed, and increases in our FSS satellite lease payment obligations. “Satellite and
transmission expenses” totaled 1.7% and 1.5% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during each of the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio
principally resulted from additional operational costs to support the commencement of service and
on-going operations of our local markets discussed above.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” totaled $305.3 million during the year
ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $110.8 million or 57.0% compared to 2003. This increase
primarily resulted from the increase in sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other
distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers discussed above, and
approximately $18.4 million in charges related to slow moving and obsolete inventory. “Cost of
sales – equipment” represented 81.8% and 65.8% of “Equipment sales,” during the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally
related to the charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory discussed above, and an approximate
$6.8 million reduction in the cost of set-top box equipment during 2003 resulting from a change in
estimated royalty obligations. This increase in the expense to revenue ratio also related to a
decline in margins on the sales of DBS accessories and on sales by our ETC subsidiary to an
international DBS service provider due to reductions in prices and increased sales of lower margin
accessories.

Cost of sales – other

. “Cost of sales – other” totaled $33.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2004, an increase of $29.8 million compared to 2003. This increase is primarily
attributable to expenses associated with the C-band subscription television service business of SNG
we acquired in April 2004.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled approximately $1.528 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $215.8 million or 16.4% compared to 2003.
“Subscriber acquisition costs” during the year ended December 31, 2003 included a benefit of
approximately $77.2 million comprised of approximately $42.8 million related to a reduction in the
cost of set-top box equipment resulting from a change in estimated royalty obligations and $34.4
million from a litigation settlement. The increase in “Subscriber acquisition costs” was
attributable to a larger number of gross DISH Network subscriber additions during the year ended
December 2004 compared to 2003, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers
participating in our equipment lease program and the acquisition of co-branded subscribers during
2004 as discussed under “SAC and Equivalent SAC” below.

SAC and Equivalent SAC

. Subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH Network subscriber activation
were approximately $444 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and approximately $453 during 2003.
SAC during the year ended December 31, 2003 included the benefit of approximately $77.2 million
discussed above. Absent this benefit, our SAC for 2003 would have been approximately $27 higher,
or $480. The decrease in SAC during the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003
(excluding this benefit) was directly attributable to the acquisition of co-branded subscribers
during 2004. Excluding the effect of co-branded subscribers, SAC would have increased during the
current year as compared to 2003. The increase in SAC (excluding the effect of co-branded
subscribers) was primarily related to more expensive promotions offered during 2004 including up to
three free receivers for new subscribers and free advanced products, such as DVRs and HD receivers.
Further, during 2004, since a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activated multiple
receivers, receivers with multiple tuners or other advanced products, including SuperDISH,
installation costs increased as compared to 2003. These factors were partially offset by an
increase in DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program and reduced
subscriber acquisition advertising.

Equipment capitalized under our lease program for new customers totaled approximately $574.8
million and $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Returned
equipment related to disconnected lease program subscribers, which became available for sale rather
than being redeployed through the lease program, together with payments received in connection with
equipment not returned to us, totaled approximately $60.8 million and $30.2 million during the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. If we included in our calculation of SAC the
equipment capitalized less the value of equipment returned and payments received, our Equivalent
SAC would have been approximately $593 during 2004 compared to $480 during 2003. As discussed
above, “Subscriber acquisition costs” during 2003 included a benefit of approximately $77.2 million
or $27 per subscriber. Absent this benefit, our Equivalent SAC would have been $507 for the year
ended December 31, 2003. This increase is primarily attributable to a greater number of DISH
Network subscribers activating multiple receivers, and advanced products, such as SuperDISH, DVRs
and HD receivers.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses” totaled $398.9 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $62.6 million or 18.6% compared to 2003.
The increase in “General and administrative expenses” was primarily attributable to increased
personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

growth of the DISH Network. “General and administrative expenses” represented 5.6% and 5.9% of
“Total revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in
this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from “Total revenue” increasing at a higher rate
than our “General and administrative expenses.”

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $502.9 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $104.7 million or 26.3% compared to 2003.
The increase in “Depreciation and amortization” expense primarily resulted from additional
depreciation related to the commencement of commercial operation of our EchoStar IX satellite in
October 2003, and increases in depreciation related to equipment leased to customers and other
depreciable assets, including finite lived intangible assets, placed in service during 2003 and
2004. As of December 31, 2003, EchoStar IV was fully depreciated and accordingly, we recorded no
expense for this satellite during the year ended December 31, 2004. This partially offset the
increase in depreciation expense discussed above.

Interest income

.

“Interest income” totaled $42.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2004,
a decrease of $22.8 million or 35.0% compared to 2003. This decrease principally resulted from
lower cash and marketable investment securities balances in 2004 as compared to 2003, partially
offset by higher total returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2004.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized

.

“Interest expense” totaled $505.7 million during the
year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $46.8 million or 8.5% compared to 2003. This decrease
primarily resulted from a net reduction in interest expense of approximately $98.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 related to the debt redemptions and repurchases of our previously
outstanding senior debt during 2003 and 2004. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in
prepayment premiums and the write-off of debt issuance costs totaling approximately $134.7 million
in 2004 compared to approximately $97.1 million in 2003. See Note 5 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other.

“Other” expense totaled $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to
“Other” income of $18.8 million during 2003, a decrease of $32.2 million. The decrease is
primarily attributable to net losses on the sale of securities from our marketable investments
portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to net gains during 2003.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

. EBITDA was $1.193 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $68.2 million or 6.1% compared to $1.125 billion
during 2003. EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2003 included a benefit of approximately
$77.2 million related to the change in estimated royalty obligations and litigation settlement
discussed above. Absent this 2003 benefit, our increase in EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2004 would have been $145.4 million. The increase in EBITDA (excluding this benefit) was primarily
attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. EBITDA does not
include the impact of capital expenditures under our new and existing subscriber equipment lease
programs of approximately $654.9 million and $118.6 million during the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net
income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of
operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure
for those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video programming distribution industry.
Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to
service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net income (loss).

“Net income” was $214.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, a
decrease of $9.7 million, or 4.3%, compared to $224.5 million for 2003. The decrease was primarily
attributable to lower “Operating income,” “Interest income” and “Other income” partially offset by
the decrease in “Interest expense” resulting from the factors discussed above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal sources of cash during 2005 were operating activities, sales of certain marketable
investment securities and an insurance claim settlement. Our principal uses of cash during 2005
were to purchase property and equipment, repurchase our Class A common stock and purchases of
marketable investment securities.

On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our ten-year, 7 1/8% Senior
Notes due February 1, 2016 in a private placement. The proceeds of the sale of the notes were used
to redeem our outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and are also intended to be used for other
general corporate purposes.

We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will
be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from
operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent
upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no
assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to
fund our 2006 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other
things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and
retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment
lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2006 will also depend on our levels of
investment in infrastructure necessary to support HD local markets and other possible strategic
initiatives. We currently anticipate that 2006 capital expenditures will be higher than 2005
capital expenditures of $1.506 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment
leased to subscribers and
expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of
satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital
expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for
subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic
investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors.
These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no
assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on
acceptable terms.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities.

We consider all liquid investments
purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See “Item 7A. – Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion regarding our marketable
investment securities. As of December 31, 2005, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash
equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $1.248 billion, including approximately
$67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.213 billion,
including $57.6 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31,
2004.

The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Free cash flow.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less
“Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We
believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period,
the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund
acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in
accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating income,” “Net
income,” “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other measure determined in accordance
with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP
liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure — “Net cash
flows from operating activities.”

Free cash flow was $267.7 million, $20.9 million, and $253.8 million for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase from 2004 to 2005 of approximately $246.8
million resulted from an increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of approximately
$772.6 million, or 77.2%, offset by a 53.6% increase in “Purchases of property and equipment,” or
approximately $525.8 million. The increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” was
primarily attributable to higher net income during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
2004, partially offset by less cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities in
2005 as compared to 2004. Cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $169.0
million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $241.7 million for 2004, a decrease of
$72.7 million, or 30.1%. This decrease resulted from decreases in cash flows from net changes in
(i) deferred revenue primarily attributable to equipment sales to AT&T which commenced during the
first quarter of 2004, (ii) accounts payable and (iii) accrued expenses. The decrease in cash
flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by an increase in cash
flows from net changes in (i) inventory, (ii) accounts receivable and (iii) noncurrent assets
primarily attributable to equipment sales to AT&T. The increase in “Purchases of property and
equipment” was primarily attributable to increased spending for (i) equipment under our lease
programs, (ii) satellite construction and (iii) general expansion to support the growth of the DISH
Network.

The decrease from 2003 to 2004 of approximately $232.9 million resulted from an increase in
“Purchases of property and equipment” of approximately $658.8 million, offset by an increase in
“Net cash flows from operating activities” of approximately $425.9 million. The increase in
“Purchases of property and equipment” was primarily attributable to increased spending for
equipment under our lease programs, satellite construction payments and prepayments under our
satellite service agreements, and for general expansion to support the growth of the DISH Network.
The increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to
significantly more cash flow generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2004 as
compared to 2003. Cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $241.7 million
during 2004 compared to negative $75.7 million in 2003. The improvement in cash flow from changes
in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (i) increases in accounts payable, (ii) accrued
programming expenses, and (iii) an increase in net deferred revenue primarily attributable to
equipment sales to AT&T, partially offset by (i) rising inventory levels, (ii) increased
subscriber accounts receivable and (iii) receivables related to AT&T.

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, free cash flow was significantly impacted
by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the “Net cash flows from operating
activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset
and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no
assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating
assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things,
management’s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to
fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary
significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth,
subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized
under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of
property and equipment and other factors.

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered
by satellite to any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8,
2006. We currently offer local broadcast channels in 164 markets across the
United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish was previously required to
receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently reduced
the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely
eliminate the second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of
EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity
limitations could force us to move the local channels in some two dish markets
to different satellites, requiring subscribers in those markets to install a
second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast channels.
We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of
those markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a
market to a single dish could result in disruptions of service for a substantial
number of our customers. Further, our ability to timely comply with this
requirement without incurring significant additional costs is dependent on,
among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite at the
129 degree orbital location until commencement of commercial operation of
EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X anomalies could force us to cease offering
local channels by satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the
single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition plan arise,
it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement
could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent subscribers are unwilling for any
reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be negatively
impacted.

In addition, we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets
at least until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the
event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but
not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites. The potential relocation of some
channels, and elimination of others, resulting from failures relating to EchoStar X or EchoStar
VIII, could cause a material adverse impact on our business, including, among other things, a
reduction in revenues, an increase in operating expenses, a decrease in new subscriber activations
and an increase in subscriber churn.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing the delivery of
superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate delivery of network channels and
superstations to a substantial number of our subscribers, which could cause many of those customers
to cancel their subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the
Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not reach private settlement
agreements with additional stations, we will attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

means to receive network channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where
available, and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict with any
degree of certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their primary DISH Network
programming as a result of termination of their distant network channels. We could be required to
terminate distant network programming to all subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on
their cross-appeal and we are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result in, among other things, a
reduction in ARPU and a temporary increase in subscriber churn.

Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the
economy, strategic opportunities or other factors.

Cash flows from operating activities.

We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating
activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure.
For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we reported net cash flows from operating
activities of $1.774 billion, $1.001 billion, and $575.6 million, respectively. See discussion of
changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in “Free cash flow” above.

Cash flows from investing activities.

Our investing activities generally include purchases and
sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our
infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we reported net cash flows
from investing activities of negative $1.460 billion, $1.078 billion, and negative $1.762 billion,
respectively.

The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of approximately $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease
in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital
expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially
offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously
discussed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005.

The increase from 2003 to 2004 of approximately $2.840 billion primarily resulted from an increase
in net sales of marketable investment securities, and from a reclassification of cash previously
restricted for satellite insurance. The increase in net cash flows from investing activities was
partially offset by increases in cash used for capital expenditures and our asset acquisition from
Gemstar (see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K).

Cash flows from financing activities.

Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the
issuance of long-term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long-term debt and
capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common
stock and our 2004 dividend payment. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
reported net cash flows from financing activities of negative $402.6 million, negative $2.666
billion, and $994.1 million, respectively.

The positive variance from 2004 to 2005 of approximately $2.263 billion principally resulted from a
decrease in cash used for redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt and in cash used for
dividends during 2005 compared to 2004. Additionally, less cash was used during 2005 for the
repurchases of our Class A common stock discussed below.

•

During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common
stock in open market transactions for a total cost of approximately $362.5 million.

The decrease from 2003 to 2004 of approximately $3.660 billion principally resulted from the
following 2004 financing activities:

•

Effective February 2, 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding
principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009.

•

Effective October 1, 2004, we redeemed all of our $1.0 billion outstanding principal
amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007.

•

During 2004, we repurchased approximately 25.9 million shares of our Class A common
stock in open market transactions for a total cost of approximately $809.6 million.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

•

On December 14, 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class
A and Class B common stock.

This decrease from 2003 to 2004 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash:

•

On October 1, 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due
2014.

•

On August 25, 2004, we sold a $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to
CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C.

In addition to the 2004 financing activities described above, the decrease in net cash flows from
financing activities from 2003 to 2004 was also partially due to $1.178 billion in net cash flows
received during 2003 from the issuance of long-term debt and the share repurchases during 2003 as
described below.

Other Liquidity Items

Subscriber turnover.

Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2005
was approximately 1.65%, compared to our percentage subscriber churn for 2004 of approximately
1.62%. Our subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but
not limited to, an increase in competition from other multi-channel video providers and new technology entrants, signal
theft and increasingly complex products. There can be no assurance that these and other factors
will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically.
Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become
subscribers and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are
also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect.

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered
by satellite to any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8,
2006. We currently offer local broadcast channels in 164 markets across the
United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish was previously required to
receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently reduced
the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely
eliminate the second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of
EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity
limitations could force us to move the local channels in some two dish markets
to different satellites, requiring subscribers in those markets to install a
second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast channels.
We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of
those markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a
market to a single dish could result in disruptions of service for a substantial
number of our customers. Further, our ability to timely comply with this
requirement without incurring significant additional costs is dependent on,
among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

at the
129 degree orbital location until commencement of commercial operation of
EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X anomalies could force us to cease offering
local channels by satellite in many markets absent regulatory relief from the
single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition plan arise,
it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement
could exceed $100.0 million. To the extent subscribers are unwilling for any
reason to upgrade to a new dish, our subscriber churn could be negatively
impacted.

In addition, we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets
at least until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the
event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but
not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites. The potential relocation of some
channels, and elimination of others, resulting from failures relating to EchoStar X or EchoStar
VIII, could cause a material adverse impact on our business, including, among other things, a
reduction in revenues, an increase in operating expenses, a decrease in new subscriber activations
and an increase in subscriber churn.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing the delivery of
superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate delivery of network channels and
superstations to a substantial number of our subscribers, which could cause many of those customers
to cancel their subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the
Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not reach private settlement
agreements with additional stations, we will attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative
means to receive network channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where
available, and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict with any
degree of certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their primary DISH Network
programming as a result of termination of their distant network channels. We could be required to
terminate distant network programming to all subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on
their cross-appeal and we are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result in, among other things, a
reduction in ARPU and a temporary increase in subscriber churn.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and
could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our
encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more
difficult. In order to combat theft of our service and maintain the functionality of active
set-top boxes, we recently replaced the majority of our older generation smart cards with newer
generation smart cards. This process was completed during the fourth quarter of 2005. These
existing smart cards have been compromised, and we are implementing software patches and other
security measures to help secure our service. However, there can be no assurance that our security
measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to
replace existing smart cards, the cost of card replacements could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base continues to increase, even if percentage
subscriber churn remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network
subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth.

Subscriber acquisition and retention costs.

Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can
vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net
income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs,” SAC and
“Subscriber-related expenses” may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more
aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition,
or for other reasons.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease
rather than purchase equipment continued to increase compared to 2004. The increase in leased
equipment and related
reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our
“Subscriber acquisition costs” and SAC declined.



Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Continued

The increase in capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers
has been, and we expect it will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the
redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain
competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology
changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render
existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the Equivalent SAC reduction associated
with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.

Several years ago we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation
technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost
to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than
if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK
technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming
channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the
acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we
add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and
create additional revenue opportunities. We have implemented MPEG-4 technology in all satellite
receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology when
implemented will result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined
the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the
period of time over which the conversions will occur. Provided EchoStar X commences commercial
operation during second quarter 2006 and other planned satellites are successfully deployed, our
8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise
required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG-4.

While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of
equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in
the short term. To the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers, SAC,
Equivalent SAC and capital expenditures will increase as well. However, the increases in these
costs would be mitigated by, among other things, our expected migration away from relatively
expensive and complex SuperDISH installations (assuming successful commencement of commercial
operation of our EchoStar X satellite and the continued availability of our other in-orbit
satellites). These increases may also be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing
set-top boxes and implement other SAC reduction strategies.

In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for
upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar
receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to
upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our
retention costs for subscribers that currently own equipment, which are included in
“Subscriber-related expenses,” and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program
for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the
costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention
programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment
lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we
offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with
other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons.

Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be
satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from
operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the
future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and
equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites under Construction.

We have entered into contracts to construct six new satellites, see
“Item 1 – Business – Our Satellites.”

•

During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI.
Construction is expected to be completed during 2007. Future commitments related to this
satellite are included in the table above.

•

During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of five additional
SSL Ka and/or Ku expanded band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008
and 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above.

Satellites under Lease.

In addition to our lease of the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites discussed
below under

Capital Lease Obligations

, we have also entered into satellite service agreements to
lease capacity on four other satellites, see “Item 1 – Business – Our Satellites.”

•

In connection with the SES Americom agreement for the lease of the AMC-15 satellite
discussed below, we are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in-orbit FSS
satellite, AMC-2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is
scheduled to continue through 2006. We have accounted for the AMC-2 satellite agreement as
an operating lease. Future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table
above.

•

During August 2003, we exercised our option under the SES Americom agreement for AMC-15
to also lease for an initial ten-year term all of the capacity on a new DBS satellite at an
orbital location to be determined at a future date. In connection with this agreement, we
prepaid $20.9 million to SES Americom during 2004. We anticipate that this satellite will
be launched during the second half of 2006 and could be used as additional backup capacity
and to offer other value-added services. We are still evaluating the accounting treatment
for this satellite lease.

•

During February 2004, we entered into a satellite service agreement for capacity on an
FSS satellite which is planned for launch during the second half of 2006. This additional
satellite could allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services. In connection with
this agreement, we prepaid $55.0 million during 2004 and are required to make monthly
payments for this satellite for the 15-year period following commencement of commercial
operation. Future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above.
We are still evaluating the accounting treatment for this satellite lease.

•

During August 2003, we entered into a satellite service agreement for capacity on a
Canadian DBS satellite at the 129 degree orbital location for an initial ten-year term. We
anticipate that this satellite will be launched during 2008. We are still evaluating the
accounting treatment for this satellite lease.

In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be
delayed. These amounts will increase when we commence payments for the launches of EchoStar XI and
the Ka-band satellites, and would further increase to the extent we procure insurance for our
satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

Capital Lease Obligations

During 2003, we entered into a satellite service agreement with SES Americom for all of the
capacity on AMC-15. The ten-year satellite service agreement for this satellite is renewable by us
on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to
replacement satellites. We are required to make monthly payments to SES Americom for this
satellite over the next ten years beginning in 2005.

During 2004, we entered into a satellite service agreement with SES Americom for all of the
capacity on AMC-16. The ten-year satellite service agreement for this satellite is renewable by us
on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. We are required to make
monthly payments to SES Americom for this satellite over the next ten years beginning in 2005.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (“SFAS 13”), we have
accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (See Note 5 in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The
commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite
component of the agreement is included under

Capital Lease Obligations

in the table above. The
commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and
other executory costs is included under

Satellite-Related Obligations

in the table above. The
commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under

Interest on Long-Term Debt

in the table above.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2006 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver
systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH
Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to
purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to, among other things, management’s control of inventory levels, and can materially
impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital
requirements.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have also entered into numerous contracts to purchase
programming content whereby our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of
subscribers to which we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not
included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years.
Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our
subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Satellite insurance.

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on our satellites. We do
not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures
because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite
failure. We believe that we have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously recover
transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites fails. However,
programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. For example,
we depend on our EchoStar VIII satellite to provide local channels to over 40 markets at least
until such time as our EchoStar X satellite has commenced commercial operation. In the event that
EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could transmit many, but not all, of
those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

Future capital requirements.

In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans
for FSS Ku-(extended) band and FSS Ka-band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the
97, 109, 113, 117 and 121 degree orbital locations.

As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we
anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2006. As previously discussed,
we expect our capital expenditures for 2006 to be higher than 2005 capital expenditures of $1.506
billion.

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would
complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise
offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our
business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or
acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our
Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of our Class A
common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. There can be no assurance
that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on
acceptable terms.

Security Ratings

Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB- on our long-term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect
to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moody’s Investor Service and
Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies
reflect each agency’s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due.

With respect to Moody’s, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are
judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For S&P, the BB-
rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations
than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure
to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor’s
inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

With respect to Moody’s, the B2 rating for our publicly traded convertible subordinated debt
indicates that the security is considered speculative and is subject to high credit risk. For S&P,
the B rating indicates the issuer is more vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal
obligations, but the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation. In general, lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs. A security rating is not
a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at
any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of
any other rating.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.
Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected
by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting
policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of
our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•

Capitalized satellite receivers

.

Since we retain ownership of certain equipment
provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we
capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of
sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the
equipment, which is based on, among other things, management’s judgment of the risk of
technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate,
the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things,
historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive
conditions.

•

Accounting for investments in private and publicly-traded securities

.

We hold debt and
equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile
prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has
experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our
investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment,
market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to
the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could
result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may
not be reflected in an investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an
impairment charge in the future.

•

Valuation of investments in non-marketable investment securities.

We calculate the fair
value of our interest in non-marketable investment securities either at consideration
given, or for non-cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses performed
by a third party valuation specialist or utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The
DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow
projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (R) (As Amended), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) which (i) revises SFAS
123 to eliminate both the disclosure only provisions of that statement and the alternative to
follow the intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations, and (ii) requires the cost
resulting from all share-based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the results of
operations over the period during which an employee provides the requisite service in exchange for
the award and establishes fair value as the measurement basis of the cost of such transactions.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R) under the modified prospective method. We expect
the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to impact our results of operation and earnings per share similar to
our pro forma disclosure in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service
industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half
of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising
and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of
such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods.

Inflation

Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that
our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will
depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products.



Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2005, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable
investment securities had a fair value of approximately $1.248 billion. Of that amount, a total of
approximately $1.095 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S.
Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of
less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk
characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing
activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, among other things, fund
operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this
portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in
our business.

Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an
average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately 3.4%. A hypothetical
10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $4.4 million in annual
interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by,
among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as
well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other
instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent
rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by
interest rate fluctuations.

At December 31, 2005, all of the $1.095 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments
or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely
impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to
maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result
in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the
effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be
re-invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Over time, any net percentage decrease in
interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest
income.

Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public and
private companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2005, we held
strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of
approximately $148.5 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt
and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and
equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities
markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we
have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments
are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities
markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our
public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $14.9 million decrease
in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are
currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these
investments.

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available-for-sale. We adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary
unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit),” net of related deferred income tax.
Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other
than temporary” are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable
investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to
the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and
company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the
contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a period of less than six
months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a period of
six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or
market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary.
Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for greater than nine months are
considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to
the contrary.



Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As of December 31, 2005, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of approximately $3.3
million as a part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’
equity (deficit).” During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $25.4 million in charges
to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment
securities. In addition, during 2005, we realized net gains of approximately $34.3 million on
sales of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments
into common stock. Realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification
method. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, our portfolio generally, and our
strategic investments particularly, has experienced and continues to experience volatility. If the
fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost
basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the
carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to
earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value.

We also have strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable investment securities which are
included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We account for our
unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting.
These equity securities are not publicly traded and accordingly, it is not practical to regularly
estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation
for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if
available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may
include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt
covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not
estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment
exists and are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, we had $94.2 million aggregate carrying amount of
non-marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $52.7 million is accounted
for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we did not record any
impairment charges with respect to these investments.

We also have a strategic investment in the non-public preferred stock and convertible debt of a
public company which is included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The investment is convertible into the issuer’s common shares. We account for this
available for sale investment at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as
unrealized gains or losses in “Other” income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the investment using
certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the investment was approximately
$42.3 million based on the trading price of the issuer’s shares on that date, and we recognized a
pre-tax unrealized gain of approximately $38.8 million for the change in the fair value of the
investment. Among other factors, as the result of the relatively large number of shares we would
hold upon conversion compared to the issuer’s limited public trading volume, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to obtain full value for our investment upon a sale of the common
shares. The issuer’s publicly traded shares have experienced, and will continue to experience
volatility. The fair value of this investment can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse
changes in the issuer’s share price, currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, interest
rates. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of the issuer’s common shares, or in the
Euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, would result in an approximate $4.2 million decrease in
the fair value of this investment.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly
traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital
to execute their business plans. Since private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there
is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire
to sell them we will not be able to obtain full value for them.

As of December 31, 2005, we estimated the fair value of our variable and fixed-rate debt, mortgages
and other notes payable to be approximately $5.357 billion using quoted market prices where
available, and third party valuations or discounted cash flow analyses when it was practicable to
do so. The interest rates assumed in these discounted cash flow analyses reflect interest rates
currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The
fair value of our fixed-rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A
hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by
approximately $140.6 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would
increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would
increase our annual interest expense by approximately $34.2 million.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. In
addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and our directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). EchoStar Communications Corporation’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our
opinion, EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar Communications Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated
March 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar Communications Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of EchoStar Communications Corporation and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of EchoStar Communications Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Business Activities

Principal Business

EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC”) is a holding company. Its subsidiaries (which together
with ECC are referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) operate two
interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k – which provides a direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription
television service in the United States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”) – which designs and develops DBS set-top boxes,
antennae and other digital equipment for the DISH Network. We refer to this equipment collectively
as “EchoStar receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and distributes similar equipment for
international satellite service providers.

We have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS System.” The EchoStar DBS
System consists of our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) allocated DBS spectrum, our owned
and leased satellites, EchoStar receiver systems, digital broadcast operations centers, customer
service facilities, and certain other assets utilized in our operations. Our principal business
strategy is to continue developing our subscription television service in the United States to
provide consumers with a fully competitive alternative to cable television service.

Organization and Legal Structure

The following table summarizes our organizational structure and our principal subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005:

owned by a direct subsidiary of EDBS. Contracts for the construction and launch of EchoStar X,
EchoStar XI and our Ka-band satellites are held in EOC II, a sister company to EDBS. Our satellite
lease contracts are also held by a direct subsidiary of EDBS. Substantially all of our operations
are conducted by subsidiaries of EDBS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Significant Risks and Uncertainties

Substantial Leverage

.

We are highly leveraged, which makes us vulnerable to changes in general
economic conditions. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding long-term debt (including both
the current and long-term portions) totaling approximately $5.935 billion. We have quarterly and
semi-annual cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long-term debt securities, as

which were redeemed on February 17, 2006 or the
$106.9 million of interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes due
2016 (see Note 15).

Interest accrues on our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2008 based on the three month London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 3.25%. The interest rate at December 31, 2005 was 7.78%.
Semi-annual cash interest requirements related to our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 commenced on
April 1, 2005. There are no scheduled principal payment or sinking fund requirements prior to
maturity on any of these notes. Our ability to meet our debt service requirements will depend on,
among other factors, the successful execution of our business strategy, which is subject to
uncertainties and contingencies beyond our control.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Effective January 1, 2004, we combined “Subscription television service” revenue and “Other
subscriber-related revenue” into “Subscriber-related revenue.” Additionally, “Equipment sales” and
“Cost of sales – equipment” now include non-DISH Network receivers and other accessories sold by
our EchoStar International Corporation subsidiary to international customers which were previously
included in “Other” revenue and “Cost of sales – other,” respectively. All prior period amounts
were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Certain other prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which we have
controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method
when we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. When we
do not have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of an issuer, the cost
method is used. For entities that are considered variable interest entities we apply the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46-R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46-R”). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and

F-8


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other things, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory allowances,
self insurance obligations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies,
fair values of financial instruments, fair value of options granted under our stock based
compensation plans, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, capital
leases, asset impairments, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, retailer
commissions, programming expenses, subscriber lives including those related to our co-branding and
other distribution relationships, royalty obligations and smart card replacement obligations.
Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and
the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively beginning in the period they occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar because
their sales and purchases are predominantly denominated in that currency. However, for our
subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars at the period end exchange rate and record the translation
adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). We translate revenues and
expenses based on the exchange rates at the time such transactions arise, if known, or at the
average rate for the period. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are recorded at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction and are included in other
miscellaneous income and expense. Net transaction gains (losses) during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
not significant.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 consist of money market funds,
corporate notes and commercial paper. The cost of these investments approximates their fair value.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Investment Securities and Restricted Cash

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available-for-sale. We adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary
unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit),” net of related deferred income tax.
Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other
than temporary” are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss),

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable
investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to
the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and
company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the
contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a period of less than six
months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a period of
six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or
market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary.
Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for greater than nine months are
considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to
the contrary.

Some of our investments in marketable investment securities have declined below our cost. The
following table reflects the length of time that the individual securities have been in an
unrealized loss position, aggregated by investment category, where those declines are considered
temporary in accordance with our policy.

Government Bonds

. The unrealized losses on our investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and direct
obligations of U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate increases. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, maturities on these government bonds ranged from one to seven months. We have the
ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity when the Government is required to
redeem them at their full face value. Accordingly, we do not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005.

Corporate Equity Securities.

The unrealized loss on our investments in corporate equity
securities represents an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the satellite
communications service industry. We believe the unrealized loss is generally attributable to
temporary market fluctuations. We are not aware of any specific factors which indicate the
unrealized loss is other than temporary.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of
approximately $3.3 million and $51.8 million, respectively, as a part of “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit).” During the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2003, we recorded aggregate charges to earnings for other than temporary
declines in the fair value of certain of our marketable investment securities of approximately
$25.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and established a new cost basis for these
securities. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we did not record any charge to earnings for
other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In
addition, during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we realized net gains (losses)
on sales of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments
into common stock of $34.3 million, ($9.0) million and $21.9 million, respectively. Realized gains
and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method.

Our approximately $1.248 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and
marketable investment securities includes debt and equity securities which we own for strategic and
financial purposes. The fair value of these strategic marketable investment securities aggregated
approximately $148.5 million and $174.3 million as of December

F-10


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, our portfolio
generally, and our strategic investments particularly, have experienced and continues to experience
volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not
remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that
indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to
record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value.

We also have strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable investment securities which are
included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We account for our
unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting.
These equity securities are not publicly traded and accordingly, it is not practical to regularly
estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation
for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if
available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may
include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt
covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not
estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment
exists and are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $94.2 million and $90.4 million aggregate carrying amount of
non-marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, respectively, of which $52.7
million in each of the years is accounted for under the cost method. During the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, we did not record any impairment charges with respect to these
investments.

We also have a strategic investment in the non-public preferred stock and convertible debt of a
public company which is included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The investment is convertible into the issuer’s common shares. We account for the
investment at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or
losses in “Other” income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the investment using certain assumptions and
judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the investment was approximately $42.3 million based on
the trading price of the issuer’s shares on that date, and we recognized a pre-tax unrealized gain
of approximately $38.8 million for the change in the fair value of the investment. Among other
factors, as the result of the relatively large number of shares we would hold upon conversion
compared to the issuer’s limited public trading volume, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to obtain full value for our investment upon a sale of the common shares.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly
traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital
to execute their business plans. Since private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there
is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire
to sell them we will not be able to obtain full value for them.

Restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets, includes, among other things, cash and marketable investment securities set aside
as collateral for our letters of credit.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the

under our satellite service agreements (Note 10), are capitalized during the construction phase,
assuming the eventual successful launch and in-orbit operation of the satellite. If a satellite
were to fail during launch or while in-orbit, the resultant loss would be charged to expense in the
period such loss was incurred. The amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of
insurance proceeds estimated to be received, if any. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line
basis over lives ranging from one to forty years. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to
expense when incurred. Renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“SFAS 144”). We review our long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Based on the guidance under SFAS 144, we evaluate our satellite fleet for
recoverability as an asset group. For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset
would be impaired if the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its undiscounted
future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment is reported as the
difference between the carrying value and the fair value as estimated using discounted cash flows.
Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
less costs to sell. We consider relevant cash flow, estimated future operating results, trends and
other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets are recoverable.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), which
requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but to be
tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairments arise. Intangible assets that
have finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Our intangible
assets consist primarily of FCC licenses. Generally, we have determined that our FCC licenses have
indefinite useful lives due to the following:

In accordance with the guidance of EITF Issue No. 02-7, “Unit of Accounting for Testing
Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset,” (“EITF 02-7”) we combine all our indefinite life
FCC licenses into a single unit of accounting. The analysis encompasses future cash flows from
satellites transmitting from such licensed orbital locations, including revenue attributable to
programming offerings from such satellites, the direct operating and subscriber acquisition costs
related to such programming, and future capital costs for replacement satellites. Projected
revenue and cost amounts included current and projected subscribers. In conducting our annual
impairment test in 2005, we determined that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses,
calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded their carrying amount.

During March 2004, we entered into an agreement with Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc.
(“Gemstar”) for use of certain Gemstar intellectual property and technology, use of the TV Guide
brand on our interactive program guides, and for distribution arrangements with Gemstar to provide
for the launch and carriage of the TV Guide Channel as well as the extension of an existing
distribution agreement for carriage of the TVG Network, and acquired Gemstar’s Superstar/Netlink
Group LLC (“SNG”), UVTV distribution, and SpaceCom businesses and related assets, for an aggregate
cash payment of $238.0 million, plus transaction costs. We further agreed to resolve all of our
outstanding

litigation with Gemstar. These transactions were entered into contemporaneously and
accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with Statement of Financial

expense is estimated to be approximately $36.7 million for 2006, $36.1 million for 2007, $22.5
million for 2008, $17.7 million for 2009, $17.7 million for 2010 and $92.6 million thereafter.

The excess of our investments in consolidated subsidiaries over net tangible and intangible asset
value at acquisition is recorded as goodwill. We had approximately $3.4 million of goodwill as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 which arose from a 2002 acquisition. In conducting our annual
impairment test in 2005, we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was not impaired.

Smart Card Replacement

Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in
the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures
intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. In order to combat theft of our
service and maintain the functionality of active set-top boxes, we recently replaced the majority
of our older generation smart cards with newer generation smart cards. This process was completed
during the fourth quarter of 2005. Accordingly, there is no remaining accrual for smart card
replacement as of December 31, 2005. The need to replace smart cards is evaluated at the end of
each reporting period.

Long-Term Deferred Revenue, Distribution and Carriage Payments

Certain programmers provide us up-front payments. Such amounts are deferred and in accordance with
EITF Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor” (“EITF 02-16”) and are recognized as reductions to “Subscriber-related
expenses” on a straight-line basis over the relevant remaining contract term (up to 10 years). The
current and long-term portions of these deferred credits are recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in “Deferred revenue and other” and “Long-term deferred revenue, distribution and carriage
payments and other long-term liabilities,” respectively.

We receive equity interests in content providers in consideration for or in conjunction with
affiliation agreements. We account for these equity interests received in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-8, “Accounting by a Grantee for an Equity Instrument to be Received
in Conjunction with Providing Goods or Services” (“EITF 00-8”). During the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, we made cash payments and entered into agreements and in 2004 assumed certain
liabilities in exchange for equity interests in certain entities.

During 2005 and 2004, we recorded approximately zero and $77.3 million related to the fair value of
these equity interests in “Other noncurrent assets,” respectively. These unconsolidated
investments are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Of the
$77.3 million recorded in 2004, approximately $56.5 million in value of these equity interests was
recorded as a deferred credit and is recognized as a reduction to “Subscriber-related expenses”
ratably as our actual costs are incurred under the related agreements in accordance with the
guidance under EITF 02-16. These deferred credits are included as a component of current “Deferred
revenue and other” and “Long-term deferred revenue, distribution and carriage payments and other
long-term liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes

We establish a provision for income taxes currently payable or receivable and for income tax
amounts deferred to future periods in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets or
liabilities be recorded for the estimated future tax effects of differences that exist between the
book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are offset by valuation
allowances in accordance with SFAS 109, when we believe it is more likely than not that such net
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair values for our publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices. The fair
values of our privately placed 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2010 and 2011, and mortgages
and other notes payable are estimated using third-party valuations or discounted cash flow analyses
when it is practicable to do so. The interest rates assumed in such discounted cash flow analyses
reflect interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar
credit quality.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

Costs of issuing debt are generally deferred and amortized to interest expense over the terms of
the respective notes (Note 5).

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, prices are determinable, collectibility is
reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered. Revenue from our subscription
television services is recognized when programming is broadcast to subscribers. Subscriber fees
for multiple set-top receivers, digital video recorders, equipment rental and other services are
recognized as revenue, monthly as earned. Revenue from advertising sales is recognized when the
related services are performed. Payments received from subscribers in advance of the broadcast or
service period are recorded as “Deferred revenue” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earned.
Revenue from equipment sales is recognized upon shipment to customers.

Contemporaneous with the commencement of sales of co-branded services pursuant to our prior
agreement with AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”), formerly known as SBC Communications, Inc., during the first
quarter of 2004, revenue from equipment sales to AT&T and development and implementation fees
received from AT&T were deferred and recognized over the estimated average co-branded subscriber
life. Revenue from installation and certain other services performed at the request of AT&T were
recognized upon completion of the services.

During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency
agreement with AT&T. Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under the
revised AT&T agreement will no longer generate equipment sales, installation or other services
revenue. Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our prior AT&T
agreement will continue to be recognized as revenue over the estimated average life of those
subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from AT&T will continue to
be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the
previous and revised agreements with AT&T.

Accounting for our new subscriber promotions which include programming discounts falls under the
scope of EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
(Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Capital Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). In accordance with EITF
01-9, programming revenues under these promotions are recorded at the discounted monthly rate
charged to the subscriber. See Subscriber Promotions below for discussion regarding the accounting
for costs under these promotions.

Subscriber-Related Expenses

The cost of television programming distribution rights is generally incurred on a per subscriber
basis and various upfront carriage payments are recognized when the related programming is
distributed to subscribers. The cost of television programming rights to distribute live sporting
events for a season or tournament is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the
course of the season or tournament. Programming costs are included in “Subscriber-related
expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
“Subscriber-related expenses” also include costs incurred in connection with our in-home service
and call center operations, overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright
royalties, residual commissions, billing, lockbox, subscriber retention and other variable
subscriber expenses. These costs are recognized as the services are performed or as incurred.

Contemporaneous with the commencement of sales of co-branded services pursuant to our prior
agreement with AT&T during the first quarter of 2004, “Subscriber-related expenses” also include
the cost of sales and expenses from equipment sales, direct costs of installation and other
services related to that relationship. Cost of sales from equipment sales to AT&T are deferred and
recognized over the estimated average co-branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and
certain other services performed at the request of AT&T are recognized as the services are
performed. Under the revised AT&T agreement, we will include costs from equipment and
installations in “Subscriber acquisition costs” or in capital expenditures, rather than in
“Subscriber-related expenses.” We will continue to include in “Subscriber-related expenses” the
costs deferred from equipment sales made to AT&T. These costs will be amortized over the life of
the subscribers acquired under the previous AT&T agreement.

Subscriber Promotions

Subscriber acquisition costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income
(Loss) consist of costs incurred to acquire new subscribers through third parties and our direct
customer acquisition distribution channel. Subscriber acquisition costs include the following line
items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss):

•

“Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes the cost of EchoStar receiver
systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment and receiver systems sold
directly by us to subscribers.

•

“Other subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes net costs related to promotional
incentives and costs related to installation.

•

“Subscriber acquisition advertising”

includes advertising and marketing expenses related
to the acquisition of new DISH Network subscribers. Advertising costs generally are
expensed as incurred.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, our significant subscriber acquisition promotions were as
follows:

Effective February 2004, our Digital Home Advantage (“DHA”) promotion provided new lease
subscribers up to four installed EchoStar receivers, including various premium models, with a
qualifying programming subscription. The subscriber was required to pay a monthly rental fee for
each leased receiver and a one-time set-up fee of $49.99, but was not required to agree to a
minimum lease period. The subscriber received a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill.
Effective October 2004, the promotion was expanded whereby the consumer may agree to either a one
or two year

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

commitment in exchange for receiving the benefits of our Digital Home Protection Plan,
an optional extended warranty program, without charge for one or two years, respectively. In
February 2005, the promotion was modified to allow new residential customers who subscribed to
“America’s Top 180” to obtain that programming at the same price as “America’s Top 120” for the
first three months. This promotion expired during April 2005.

During May 2005, we introduced a promotion which offers new DHA lease program subscribers our
“America’s Top 180” package for $19.99 for each of the first three months of service. Effective
June 2005, the promotion was modified to provide a $12.00 discount per month on qualifying
programming packages, together with free HBO and Showtime programming, for each of the first three
months of service. The promotion, which continued through August 15, 2005, required a one year
minimum programming commitment.

During August 2005, we introduced a promotion which offers new DHA lease program subscribers a free
month of qualifying programming, three free months of HBO, Showtime and Cinemax programming, and a
free DVR upgrade. Further, in exchange for an 18 month minimum programming commitment, new lease
program subscribers receive a credit of the one-time set-up fee of $49.99. Effective November 3,
2005, instead of one month free, new lease program subscribers can elect to receive a $12.00
discount for the first three months of service on qualifying programming. These promotions expired
January 31, 2006.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we began test marketing a prepay program, “DISH Now.” This
program allows consumers who might not be attracted by our existing promotions to purchase a
satellite receiver system and a prepaid card which can be refreshed periodically through additional
prepayments. We have not yet determined whether this program will be offered broadly.

Accounting for dealer sales under our promotions fall within the scope of EITF 01-9. In accordance
with that guidance, we characterize amounts paid to our independent dealers as consideration for
equipment installation services and for equipment buydowns (commissions and rebates) as a reduction
of revenue. We expense payments for equipment installation services as “Other subscriber promotion
subsidies.” Our payments for equipment buydowns represent a partial or complete return of the
dealer’s purchase price and are, therefore, netted against the proceeds received from the dealer.
We report the net cost from our various sales promotions through our independent dealer network as
a component of “Other subscriber promotion subsidies.” No net proceeds from the sale of subscriber
related equipment pursuant to our subscriber acquisition promotions are recognized as revenue.
Accordingly, subscriber acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred except for under our
equipment lease promotion wherein we retain title to the receiver and certain other equipment
resulting in the capitalization and depreciation of such equipment cost over its estimated useful
life.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled
$46.1 million, $40.0 million and $32.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

We apply the intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB 25”) and related interpretations in accounting
for our stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 8. Under APB 25, we
generally do not recognize compensation expense on the grant of options under our Stock Incentive
Plan because typically the option terms are fixed and the exercise price equals or exceeds the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. We apply the disclosure only provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting and Disclosure of Stock-Based
Compensation,” (“SFAS 123”).

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has
been determined as if we had accounted for our stock-based compensation plans using the fair value
method prescribed by that statement.

Options to purchase 6.4 million shares pursuant to a long-term incentive plan under our 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “1999 LTIP”), and 4.8 million shares pursuant to the 2005 LTIP were outstanding
as of December 31, 2005. These options were granted with exercise prices at least equal to the
market value of the underlying shares on the dates they were issued. The weighted-average exercise
price of these options is $8.85 under our 1999 LTIP and $29.40 under our 2005 LTIP. Further,
pursuant to the 2005 LTIP, there were also approximately 545,000 outstanding Restricted Performance
Units as of December 31, 2005. Vesting of these options and Restricted Performance Units is
contingent upon meeting certain longer-term goals which have not yet been achieved. Consequently,
no compensation was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005 related to these long-term
options and Restricted Performance Units or is included in the table above. We will record the
related compensation upon the achievement of the performance goals, if ever. Such compensation, if
recorded, would likely result in total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately
$129.0 million, which would be recognized ratably over the vesting period or expensed immediately,
if fully vested, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

For purposes of this pro forma presentation, the fair value of each option grant was estimated at
the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

During December 2004, we paid a one-time dividend of $1 per outstanding share of our Class A and
Class B common stock (Note 7) for the first time in our company’s history. We do not intend to pay
additional dividends on our common stock and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for
all periods. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and so, our
estimate of fair value may differ from other valuation models. Further, the Black-Scholes model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock-based compensation awards.

F-19


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

During 2005 and 2004, in accordance with the guidance under SFAS 123 for selecting assumptions to
use in an option pricing model, we reduced our estimate of expected volatility based upon a
re-evaluation of the variability in the market price of our publicly traded stock. Historically,
we have relied on the variability in our daily stock price since inception to derive our estimate
of expected volatility. Upon review of this variability in our stock price over more recent
periods, we believe unadjusted historical experience is a relatively poor predictor of our future
expectation of volatility. Accordingly, we specifically identified extraordinary events in our
history which resulted in irregular movements in our stock price, and have disregarded the related
periods in calculating our historical average annual volatility. This adjustment, together with
changes in the intervals of our regular historical price observations from daily to monthly,
contributed to the reduction in our estimated volatility factor.

We will continue to evaluate our assumptions used to derive the estimated fair value of options for
EchoStar’s stock as new events or changes in circumstances become known.

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (“SFAS 128”) requires
entities to present both basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
stock options were exercised and convertible securities were converted to common stock.

The potential dilution from our subordinated notes convertible into common stock was computed using
the if converted method. Since we reported net income attributable to common stockholders for the
years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the potential dilution from stock options
exercisable into common stock for these periods was computed using the treasury stock method based
on the average market value of our Class A common stock for the period. The following table
reflects the basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share amounts for all periods are presented below in
accordance with the requirements of SFAS 128.

As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 there were approximately 10.4 million, 10.9 million, and
10.1 million options for shares of Class A common stock outstanding, respectively, not included in
the above denominator as their effect is antidilutive. Further, as of December 31, 2005, there
were options to purchase approximately 11.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, and rights
to acquire approximately 545,000 shares of our Class A common stock (“Restricted Performance
Units”), outstanding under our long term incentive plans not included in the above denominator.
Vesting of these options and Restricted Performance Units is contingent upon meeting
certain longer-term goals which have not yet been achieved, and as a consequence, are not included
in the diluted EPS calculation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (R) (As Amended), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) which (i) revises SFAS
123 to eliminate both the disclosure only provisions of that statement and the alternative to
follow the intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations, and (ii) requires the cost
resulting from all share-based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the results of
operations over the period during which an employee provides the requisite service in exchange for
the award and establishes fair value as the measurement basis of the cost of such transactions.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R) under the modified prospective method. We expect
the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to impact our results of operation and earnings per share similar to
our pro forma disclosure above.

3. Settlement of EchoStar IV Arbitration

During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad
faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. We also
retained title to and use of the EchoStar IV satellite. The $134.0 million received in excess of
our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as
a “Gain on insurance settlement” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss) during first quarter 2005. We have received all amounts due under the settlement.

Our Satellites

We presently have 14 owned or leased satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles
above the equator. Each of the satellites we own had an original minimum useful life of at least 12 years. Our satellite fleet is a major
component of our EchoStar DBS System. While we believe that overall our satellite fleet is generally in good condition, during 2005 and prior periods, certain satellites within our fleet have
experienced various anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their
commercial operation. We currently do not carry insurance for any of our owned in-orbit
satellites. We believe we have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously recover
transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites fails. However,
programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses.

EchoStar I and II.

EchoStar I and II currently operate at the 148 degree orbital location. Each
of these Series 7000 class satellites, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation
(“Lockheed”), has 16 transponders that operate at approximately 130 watts of power. While both
satellites are currently functioning properly in orbit, similar Lockheed Series 7000 class
satellites owned by third parties have experienced total in-orbit failure. While no telemetry or
other data indicates EchoStar I or EchoStar II would be expected to experience a similar failure,
Lockheed has been unable to conclude these and other Series 7000 satellites will not experience
similar failures. EchoStar I and II are each equipped with 24 Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers
(“TWTA”), of which 16 are required to support full operation on each satellite. Prior to 2005,
anomalies left each satellite with 23 usable TWTAs. While we do not expect a large number of
additional TWTAs to fail in any year, it is likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from
time to time in the future, and that those failures may impact commercial operation of the
satellites. The TWTA failures have not reduced the remaining estimated useful life of the
satellite.

EchoStar III.

Our EchoStar III satellite operates at the 61.5 degree orbital location. While
originally designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel,
switchable to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per channel, the satellite was equipped
with a total of 44 TWTAs to provide redundancy. As of January 8, 2006, this satellite has
experienced 11 transponder pair (22 TWTA) failures. As a result, EchoStar III can now operate a
maximum of 22 transponders, but due to redundancy switching limitations and specific channel
authorizations, it currently can only operate 17 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies we utilize at
the 61.5 degree west orbital location for this spacecraft. While we don’t expect a large number of
additional TWTAs to fail in any year, it is likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from
time to time in the future, and that those failures will further impact commercial operation of the
satellite. The TWTA failures have not reduced the remaining estimated useful life of the
satellite.

F-23


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

EchoStar IV.

Our EchoStar IV satellite was originally designed to operate a maximum of 32
transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at
over 230 watts per channel. During July 2005, we relocated our EchoStar IV satellite from our 157
degree orbital location to a third party Mexican DBS orbital slot located at 77 degrees. During
the relocation, EchoStar IV experienced a thruster anomaly which has not impacted commercial
operation of the satellite. Prior to 2004, this satellite experienced failures with the deployment
of its solar arrays and with 38 of its 44 transponders (including spares), and further experienced
anomalies affecting its thermal systems and propulsion systems. Several years ago, we filed an
insurance claim for a total loss under the launch insurance policies covering this satellite.
During March 2005, we settled this insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad
faith with the insurers for a net amount of $240.0 million (see Note 3). During September
2004, the south solar array on EchoStar IV deployed fully and appears to be producing nominal
current. There can be no assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use, of
EchoStar IV will not occur in the immediate future. As discussed above, EchoStar IV is only
capable of operating six of its 44 transponders and is fully depreciated.

EchoStar V.

EchoStar V, which is currently located at the 129 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 110 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at over 220 watts per channel. Momentum wheel failures on this
satellite in prior years resulted in increased fuel consumption and caused a minor reduction of
spacecraft life. During 2005, we determined those anomalies will reduce the life of EchoStar V
more than previously estimated, and as a result, we reduced the estimated remaining useful life of
the satellite from approximately seven years to approximately six years effective January 2005.
EchoStar V has been utilized as an in-orbit spare since February 2003. On June 30, 2005, the FCC
approved our request to use this satellite to provide service to the United States from a third
party Canadian DBS orbital slot located at the 129 degree orbital location. Due to the increase in
fuel consumption resulting from the relocation of EchoStar V from the 119 degree orbital location
to the 129 degree orbital location, effective July 1, 2005, we further reduced the satellite’s
estimated remaining useful life from approximately six years to approximately 40 months. These
reductions in estimated remaining useful life during 2005 increased our depreciation expense
related to the satellite by approximately $9.2 million in 2005 and will increase it by
approximately $15.3 million annually thereafter. Prior to 2005, EchoStar V experienced anomalies
resulting in the loss of five solar array strings out of a total of 96 available, reducing solar
array power to approximately 95% of its original capacity. During August 2005, EchoStar V lost an
additional solar array string. The loss is not expected to impact commercial operation of the
satellite or its remaining useful life. There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not
further impact the useful life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VI.

EchoStar VI, which currently operates at the 110 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 225 watts per channel. This satellite has a total of 108
solar array strings. Approximately 102 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year estimated useful life of the satellite. Prior to 2005, EchoStar VI lost a total
of five solar array strings. During 2005, EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss
of 11 additional solar array strings bringing the total number of string losses to 16, and reducing
the number of functional solar array strings available to 92. The solar array anomalies will
prevent the use of some of those transponders for the full 12-year estimated useful life of the
satellite. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the solar array
anomalies have not impacted commercial operation of the satellite or reduced its estimated useful
life below 12 years. There can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses
which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VII.

EchoStar VII, which currently operates at the 119 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel. Each transponder can transmit
multiple digital video, audio and data
channels. EchoStar VII also includes spot beam technology. During 2004, our EchoStar VII
satellite lost a solar array circuit. EchoStar VII was designed with 24 solar array circuits and
needs 23 for the spacecraft to be fully operational at end

of life. While this anomaly is not
expected to reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years and has not
impacted commercial operation of the satellite to date, an investigation of the anomaly is
continuing. Until the root causes are finally determined, there can be no assurance future
anomalies will not cause further losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VIII.

EchoStar VIII, which currently operates at the 110 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel. EchoStar VIII also includes
spot-beam technology. During January 2005, one of the computer components in its control
electronics experienced an anomaly. The processors were successfully reset during April 2005,
restoring full redundancy in the spacecraft control electronics. During July 2005, a thruster
experienced a “bubble” event in a propellant line which caused improper pointing of the satellite
resulting in a loss of service. Service was restored within several hours and the thruster is
currently operating normally. During February 2005, EchoStar VIII lost a solar array string,
reducing solar array power to approximately 99% of its original capacity. Until the root cause of
these anomalies are determined, there can be no assurance that a repeat of the July 2005 anomaly,
or other anomalies, will not cause further losses which could materially impact its commercial
operation, or result in a total loss of the satellite. These and other anomalies previously
disclosed have not reduced the 12-year estimated useful life of the satellite. We depend on
EchoStar VIII to provide local channels to over 40 markets at least until such time as our EchoStar
X satellite has commenced commercial operation, which is currently expected during second quarter
2006. In the event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial failure, we could
transmit many, but not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

EchoStar IX.

EchoStar IX, which currently operates at the 121 degree orbital location, was
designed to operate 32 Ku-band transponders at approximately 110 watts per channel, along with
transponders that can provide services in Ka-Band (a “Ka-band payload”). EchoStar IX provides
expanded video and audio channels to DISH Network subscribers who install a specially-designed
dish. The Ka-band spectrum is being used to test and verify potential future broadband initiatives
and to implement those services. The satellite also includes a C-band payload which is owned by a
third party.

EchoStar X.

EchoStar X, a DBS satellite which can operate up to 49 spot beams using up
to 42 active 140 watt TWTAs, was launched on February 15, 2006. Assuming successful completion of
in-orbit testing, the satellite is expected to commence commercial operations during the second
quarter of 2006 at the 110 degree orbital location. The spot beams on EchoStar X are designed to
increase the number of markets where we can offer local channels by satellite, including high
definition local channels.

EchoStar XII.

EchoStar XII, previously known as Rainbow 1, currently operates at the 61.5 degree
orbital location. This direct broadcast satellite, which was purchased in November 2005 from
Rainbow DBS Co., a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation, was designed to provide all
CONUS, all Spot Beam, or a mixture of CONUS and Spot Beam coverage. In the all CONUS
configuration, the spacecraft can operate 13 transponders (26 TWTAs) at 270 watts per channel. In
the all Spot Beam mode, the spacecraft can operate up to 22 spot beams using a combination of 135
and 65 watt TWTAs. We are currently using the payload in the all CONUS configuration.

EchoStar XII experienced one north solar array circuit failure during May 2005 and one south solar
array circuit failure during September 2004. The south solar array circuit has since partially
recovered. The reason for the failures is unknown, but believed to be caused by an internal
electrical short circuit. While this anomaly is not expected to reduce the remaining useful life
of the satellite to less than 10 years and has not impacted commercial operation of the satellite
to date, an investigation of the anomaly is continuing. Until the root causes are finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further losses, which could
impact commercial operation of the satellite.

SFAS 144 requires a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstance indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Based on the
guidance under SFAS 144, we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as an asset group.
While certain of the anomalies discussed above, and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

previously disclosed, may be considered to
represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of an individual satellite, based
on the redundancy designed within each satellite and considering the asset grouping, these
anomalies (none of which caused a loss of service for an extended period) are not considered to be
significant events that would require evaluation for impairment recognition pursuant to the
guidance under SFAS 144. Should any one satellite be abandoned or determined to have no service
potential, the net carrying amount would be written off.

During 2003, we entered into a satellite service agreement with SES Americom for all of the
capacity on a Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) satellite, AMC-15, which successfully launched during
the fourth quarter of 2004 and commenced commercial operation in January 2005. The ten-year
satellite service agreement for this satellite is renewable by us on a year to year basis following
the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. We are required
to make monthly payments to SES Americom for this satellite over the ten year satellite service
agreement beginning in 2005. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13
(“SFAS 13”), we have accounted for the satellite component of this agreement as a capital lease.

During 2004, we entered into a satellite service agreement for capacity on another FSS satellite,
AMC-16, which launched during the fourth quarter of 2004 and commenced commercial operation during
the first quarter of 2005. The ten-year satellite service agreement for this satellite is
renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain
rights to replacement satellites. We are required to make monthly payments to SES Americom for
this satellite over the ten year satellite service agreement beginning in 2005. In accordance with
SFAS 13, we have accounted for the satellite component of this agreement as a capital lease.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $551.6 million and $330.8 million
capitalized for the estimated fair value of satellites acquired under capital leases included in
“Property and equipment, net,” respectively, with related accumulated depreciation of approximately
$53.3 million and zero, respectively. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations and

6. Income Taxes

As of December 31, 2005, we had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”) for federal income tax
purposes of approximately $2.632 billion and tax benefits related to capital loss and credit
carryforwards of approximately $36.6 million. The NOL’s begin to expire in the year 2011 and
capital loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the year 2006.

Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, as well as probable operating loss, tax credit and other carryforwards. We follow the
guidelines set forth in SFAS 109 regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. In accordance with SFAS
109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance. Determining necessary valuation
allowances requires us to make assessments about historical financial information as well as the
timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available
tax planning opportunities. We had income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003. During the second quarter of 2005, we concluded the recoverability of certain of
our deferred tax assets was more likely than not and accordingly reversed the portion of the
valuation allowance which was no longer required. As of December 31, 2005, there remains
approximately $11.4 million of valuation allowance which relates to deferred tax assets for credit
carryforwards which begin to expire in the year 2006.

During 2005, we decreased our deferred tax valuation allowance by approximately $990.6 million with
$914.8 million of the reversal charged to the income statement and $75.8 million recorded to
equity. Reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believe
are more likely than not to be realizable

F-32


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

resulted in an approximate $592.8 million credit to our
provision for income taxes. We also recorded valuation allowance activity of $322.0 million
throughout 2005 primarily related to the generation of taxable income. As a result, net income
increased by corresponding amounts. The amount reversed to equity during the year related to stock
compensation and unrealized gains and losses. We recorded this reversal to “Additional paid-in
capital” and “Other comprehensive income (loss).”

The Federal NOL includes amounts related to tax deductions totaling approximately $274.7 million
for exercised stock options. The tax benefit of these deductions has been allocated directly to
contributed capital.

Stock option compensation expenses related to the 1999 Incentive Plan, for which an estimated
deferred tax benefit was previously recorded exceeded the actual tax deductions allowed during 2005
and 2004. Tax charges associated with the reversal of the prior tax benefit have been allocated to
“Additional paid-in capital” in accordance with APB 25. During 2005 and 2004, charges of $10.4
million and $2.2 million, respectively, were made to additional paid-in capital.

7. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)

Common Stock

The Class A, Class B and Class C common stock are equivalent except for voting rights. Holders of
Class A and Class C common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common
stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Each share of Class B and Class C common stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A common stock. Upon a change in
control of ECC, each holder of outstanding shares of Class C common stock is entitled to 10 votes
for each share of Class C common stock held. Our principal stockholder owns the majority of all
outstanding Class B common stock and, together with all other stockholders, owns outstanding Class
A common stock. There are no shares of Class C common stock outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase Programs

During the fourth quarter of 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate
of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock. As of July 15, 2004, we had completed this
share repurchase plan, having purchased a total of 31.8 million shares of our Class A common stock
for a total of $1.0 billion.

During August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of up to an
additional $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock pursuant to a new repurchase plan. During
2005, we purchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for approximately
$362.5 million. Our share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number or
amount of securities and may be terminated at any time.

Cash Dividend

During 2004, we paid a one-time cash dividend of $1.00 per share, or approximately $455.7 million,
on outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.

8. Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Incentive Plans

We have adopted stock incentive plans to attract and retain officers, directors and key employees.
We currently have 80.0 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for granting awards
under our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and an additional 80.0 million shares of our Class A common
stock for granting awards under our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. In general, stock options granted
through December 31, 2005 have included exercise prices not less than the fair value of our Class A
common stock at the date of grant, a maximum term of ten years and vest, as determined by our Board
of Directors, generally at the rate of 20% per year.

During 1999, we adopted an incentive plan under our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, which provided
certain key employees a contingent incentive including stock options and cash. The payment of
these incentives was contingent upon our achievement of certain financial and other goals. We met
certain of these goals during 1999. Accordingly, in 1999, we recorded approximately $178.8 million
of deferred compensation related to post-grant appreciation of options to purchase approximately
4.2 million shares. The related deferred compensation, net of forfeitures, was recognized over the
five-year option vesting period. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized
expense of $1.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively, under the 1999 incentive plan. Subsequent
to December 31, 2004, there was no remaining deferred compensation to be recognized under this
plan.

Effective January 26, 2005, we adopted a long-term, performance-based stock incentive plan (the
“2005 LTIP”) within the terms of our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan to provide incentive to our
executive officers and certain other key employees upon achievement of specified long-term business
objectives. Employees participating in the 2005 LTIP may elect to receive a one-time award of (i)
an option to acquire a specified number of shares priced at market value on the date of the awards,
(ii) rights to acquire for no additional consideration a specified smaller number of shares of our
Class A common stock; or (iii) a corresponding combination of a lesser number of option shares and
such rights to acquire our Class A common stock. The options and rights will vest at a varying
rate over a seven year period; provided, however, that none of the options or rights will vest if
we fail to achieve the specified long-term performance goal. We will record the related
compensation if achievement of this performance goal becomes probable.

Options to purchase 6.4 million shares pursuant to a long-term incentive plan under our 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “1999 LTIP”), and 4.8 million shares pursuant to the 2005 LTIP were outstanding
as of December 31, 2005. These options were granted with exercise prices at least equal to the
market value of the underlying shares on the dates they were issued. The weighted-average exercise
price of these options is $8.85 under our 1999 LTIP and $29.40 under our 2005 LTIP. The
weighted-average fair value of the options granted during 2005 pursuant to these plans was $14.06.
Further, pursuant to the 2005 LTIP, there were also approximately 545,000 outstanding Restricted
Performance Units as of December 31, 2005 with a weighted average grant date fair value of $29.33.
Vesting of these options and Restricted Performance Units is contingent upon meeting certain
longer-term goals which have not yet been achieved. Consequently, no compensation was recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2005 related to these long-term options and Restricted
Performance Units. We will record the related compensation upon the achievement of the performance
goals, if ever. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), such compensation, if recorded, would result in
total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $129.0 million, which would be recognized ratably over the vesting period or expensed immediately,
if fully vested, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

9. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the
“ESPP”), effective beginning October 1, 1997. Under the ESPP, we are authorized to issue a total
of 800,000 shares of Class A common stock. Substantially all full-time employees who have been
employed by us for at least one calendar quarter are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Employee
stock purchases are made through payroll deductions. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees may
not deduct an amount which would permit such employee to purchase our capital stock under all of
our stock purchase plans at a rate which would exceed $25,000 in fair value of capital stock in any
one year. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the closing price of the Class A common stock
on the last business day of each calendar quarter in which such shares of Class A common stock are
deemed sold to an employee under the ESPP. The ESPP shall terminate upon the first to occur of (i)
October 1, 2007 or (ii) the date on which the ESPP is terminated by the Board of Directors. During
2005, 2004 and 2003 employees purchased approximately 97,000, 78,000, and 66,000 shares of Class A
common stock through the ESPP, respectively.

401(k) Employee Savings Plan

We sponsor a 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for eligible employees. Voluntary
employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be matched 50% by us, subject to a maximum annual
contribution by us of $1,000 per employee. Forfeitures of unvested participant balances which are
retained by the 401(k) Plan may be used to fund matching and discretionary contributions. Expense
recognized related to matching 401(k) contributions, net of forfeitures, totaled approximately $200
thousand during the year ended December 31, 2005. We did not recognize any expense related to
matching 401(k) contributions during the year ended December 31, 2004, as 401(k) Plan forfeitures
were sufficient to fund all of the Company matching contributions. Expense recognized related to
matching 401(k) contributions, net of forfeitures, totaled approximately $632 thousand during the
year ended December 31, 2003.

We also may make an annual discretionary contribution to the plan with approval by our Board of
Directors, subject to the maximum deductible limit provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. These contributions may be made in cash or in our stock. Discretionary contributions,
net of forfeitures, were approximately $15.4 million, $12.8 million, and $15.4 million relating to
the 401(k) Plan years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites under Construction.

We have entered into contracts to construct six new satellites.

During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI, a Space Systems Loral
FS1300 class DBS satellite. In connection with this agreement, we obtained an option for the
construction of other additional satellites. Construction is expected to be completed during 2007.
Future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above.

During 2005 and 2004, we entered into contracts for the construction of five additional SSL Ka
and/or Ku expanded band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008.

Satellites under Lease.

In addition to our lease of the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites (Note 5), we
have also entered into satellite service agreements to lease capacity on four other satellites.

In connection with the SES Americom agreement for the lease of the AMC-15 satellite discussed under

Capital Lease Obligations

(Note 5), we are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing
in-orbit FSS satellite, AMC-2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is
scheduled to continue through 2006. We have accounted for the AMC-2 satellite agreement as an
operating lease.

F-37


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

During August 2003, we exercised our option under the SES Americom agreement for AMC-15 to also
lease for an initial ten-year term all of the capacity on a new DBS satellite at an orbital
location to be determined at a future date. In connection with this agreement, we prepaid $20.9
million to SES Americom during 2004. We anticipate that this satellite will be launched during the
second half of 2006.

During February 2004, we entered into a satellite service agreement for capacity on an FSS
satellite which is planned for launch during the second half of 2006. In connection with this
agreement, we prepaid $55.0 million during 2004 and are required to make monthly payments for this
satellite for the 15-year period following commencement of commercial operation. Future
commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above.

During August 2003, we entered into a satellite service agreement for capacity on a Canadian DBS
satellite at the 129 degree orbital location for an initial ten-year term. We anticipate that this
satellite will be launched during 2008.

In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be
delayed. These amounts will increase when we commence payments for the launches of EchoStar XI and
the Ka-band satellites, and would further increase to the extent we procure insurance for our
satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2006 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver
systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH
Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to
purchase programming content.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have also entered into numerous contracts to purchase
programming content whereby our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of
subscribers to which we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not
included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years.
Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our
subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Rent Expense

Total rent expense for operating leases approximated $67.6 million, $59.1 million and $32.2 million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now have and may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services directly or indirectly
related to those that we offer. We may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property
rights that our products may potentially infringe. Damages in patent infringement cases can
include a tripling of actual damages in certain cases. Further, we cannot estimate the extent to
which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others
and the availability and cost of any such licenses. Various parties have asserted patent and other
intellectual property rights with respect to components within our direct broadcast satellite
system. We cannot be certain that these persons do not own the rights they claim, that our
products do not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these
persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we
would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

F-38


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Contingencies

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, we obtained feeds of distant broadcast network channels (ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX)
for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24. In December 1998, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami entered a nationwide permanent
injunction requiring PrimeTime 24 to shut off distant network channels to many of its customers,
and henceforth to sell those channels to consumers in accordance with the injunction.

In October 1998, we filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX in the United
States District Court for the District of Colorado. We asked the Court to find that our method of
providing distant network programming did not violate the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act
(“SHVIA”) and hence did not infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November 1998, the networks and
their affiliate association groups filed a complaint against us in Miami Federal Court alleging,
among other things, copyright infringement. The Court combined the case that we filed in Colorado
with the case in Miami and transferred it to the Miami Federal Court.

In February 1999, the networks filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary
Injunction and Contempt Finding against DirecTV, Inc. in Miami related to the delivery of distant
network channels to DirecTV customers by satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the
networks. Under the terms of the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV
customers were scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels by
July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by December 31, 1999.
Subsequently, substantially all providers of satellite-delivered network programming other than us
agreed to this cut-off schedule, although we do not know if they adhered to this schedule.

In April 2002, we reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one of the plaintiffs in the
litigation, and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. In November 2002, we reached a private
settlement with NBC, another of the plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of
dismissal. During March 2004, we reached a private settlement with CBS, another of the plaintiffs
in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. We have also reached private
settlements with many independent stations and station groups. We were unable to reach a
settlement with five of the original eight plaintiffs – FOX and the independent affiliate groups
associated with each of the four networks.

A trial took place during April 2003 and the District Court issued a final judgment in June 2003.
The District Court found that with one exception our current distant network qualification
procedures comply with the law. We have revised our procedures to comply with the District Court’s
Order. Although the plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter an injunction precluding us from
selling any local or distant network programming, the District Court refused. While the plaintiffs
did not claim monetary damages and none were awarded, the plaintiffs were awarded approximately
$4.8 million in attorneys’ fees. This amount is substantially less than the amount the plaintiffs
sought. We asked the Court to reconsider the award and the Court has vacated the fee award. When
the award was vacated, the District Court also allowed us an opportunity to conduct discovery
concerning the amount of plaintiffs’ requested fees. The parties have agreed to postpone discovery
and an evidentiary hearing regarding attorneys’ fees until after the Court of Appeals rules on the
pending appeal of the Court’s June 2003 final judgment. It is not possible to make an assessment
of the probable outcome of plaintiffs’ outstanding request for fees.

The District Court’s injunction requires us to use a computer model to re-qualify, as of June 2003,
all of our subscribers who receive ABC, NBC, CBS or FOX programming by satellite from a market
other than the city in which the subscriber lives. The Court also invalidated all waivers
historically provided by network stations. These waivers, which have been provided by stations for
the past several years through a third party automated system, allow subscribers who believe the
computer model improperly disqualified them for distant network channels to nonetheless receive those channels by satellite. Further, the District Court terminated the right
of our grandfathered subscribers to continue to receive distant network channels.

F-39


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

We believe the District Court made a number of errors and appealed the decision. Plaintiffs
cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals granted our request to stay the injunction until our appeal
is decided. Oral arguments occurred during February 2004. It is not possible to predict how or
when the Court of Appeals will rule on the merits of our appeal. On April 13, 2005, Plaintiffs
filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals to vacate the stay of the injunction that was issued in
August 2004. We responded on April 25, 2005. It is not possible to predict how or when the Court
of Appeals will rule on Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the stay.

In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the injunction or lifts the stay as plaintiffs now
request, and if we do not reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will
attempt to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network channels, including
migration to local channels by satellite where available, and free off air antenna offers in other
markets. However, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many subscribers would cancel
their primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all subscribers in the
event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we are permanently enjoined from delivering
all distant network channels. Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would
result, among other things, in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in subscriber churn.

Superguide

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) filed suit against us, DirecTV and others in the
United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division,
alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,038,211 (the ‘211 patent), 5,293,357 (the ‘357
patent) and 4,751,578 (the ‘578 patent) which relate to certain electronic program guide functions,
including the use of electronic program guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and
declaratory relief and damages in an unspecified amount.

On summary judgment, the District Court ruled that none of the asserted patents were infringed by
us. These rulings were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
During February 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the District
Court’s findings and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. In July
2005, SuperGuide indicated that it would no longer pursue infringement allegations with respect to
the ‘211 and ‘357 patents and those patents have now been dismissed from the suit. We examined the
‘578 patent and believe that it is not infringed by any of our products or services. We will
continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we
infringe on any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble
damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly
electronic programming guide and related features that we currently offer to consumers. The case
is stayed pending the District Court’s ruling. A trial date has not been set. It is not possible
to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

In November of 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV, Thomson
Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the ‘066
patent). The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and receiving
data along with specific formatting information for the data. The ‘066 patent relates to certain
methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on removable
cards. We examined these patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or
services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving us as the
only defendant.

During January 2004, the judge issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid. In August of 2004,
the Court ruled the ‘094 invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter
and Comcast. In August of 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(“CAFC”) overturned this finding of invalidity and remanded the case back to the District Court.
Charter has filed a petition for rehearing and the CAFC has asked Broadcom to respond to the
petition. Our case remains stayed pending resolution of the Charter case. We intend to

continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe
on any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages
and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that
we currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome
of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

TiVo Inc.

During January 2004, TiVo Inc. (“TiVo”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent No.
6,233,389 (the ‘389 patent). The ‘389 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing
what the patent calls “time-warping.” We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is
infringed by any of our products or services. During March 2005, the Court denied our motion to
transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
The trial is scheduled to commence on March 27, 2006 in Marshall, Texas. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we
may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that
could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to
consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the suit or to
determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

On April 29, 2005, we filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Texas against TiVo and Humax USA, Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,774,186 (the
‘186 patent), 6,529,685 (the ‘685 patent), 6,208,804 (the ‘804 patent) and 6,173,112 (the ‘112
patent). These patents relate to digital video recorder (“DVR”) technology. Trial is currently
scheduled for February 2007.

Acacia

In June 2004, Acacia Media Technologies filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California. The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast, Charter, Cox
and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants. Acacia is an intellectual property holding
company which seeks to license the patent portfolio that it has acquired. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992 (the ‘992 patent), 5,253,275 (the ‘275 patent),
5,550,863 (the ‘863 patent), 6,002,720 (the ‘720 patent) and 6,144,702 (the ‘702 patent). The
‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘702 patents have been asserted against us.

The asserted patents relate to various systems and methods related to the transmission of digital
data. The ‘992 and ‘702 patents have also been asserted against several internet adult content
providers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On July 12,
2004, that Court issued a Markman ruling which found that the ‘992 and ‘702 patents were not as
broad as Acacia had contended.

Acacia’s various patent infringement cases have now been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the
United States District court for the Northern District of California. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe on any of the
patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of
the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Forgent

In July of 2005, Forgent Networks, Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit also named DirecTV, Charter, Comcast, Time
Warner Cable, Cable One and Cox as defendants. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent No. 6,285,746 (the ‘746 patent).

The ‘746 patent discloses a video teleconferencing system which utilizes digital telephone lines.
We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. Trial is currently scheduled for February 2007 in Marshall, Texas. We intend to
vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this
patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome of
the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

California Action

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal clear digital video,”
“CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and with respect to the number of channels
available in various programming packages was filed against us in the California State Superior
Court for Los Angeles County in 1999 by David Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit
unincorporated association. The claim was denied class certification. In December 2005, we
reached a settlement for an immaterial amount with the individual plaintiffs.

Retailer Class Actions

During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed by retailers in the Arapahoe County District
Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District Court for the District of Colorado,
respectively, by Air Communication & Satellite, Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of
themselves and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify
nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The plaintiffs are
requesting the Courts to declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged agreements between
us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and
payments, charge backs, and other compensation. We are vigorously defending against the suits and
have asserted a variety of counterclaims. The United States District Court for the District of
Colorado stayed the Federal Court action to allow the parties to pursue a comprehensive
adjudication of their dispute in the Arapahoe County State Court. John DeJong, d/b/a Nexwave, and
Joseph Kelley, d/b/a Keltronics, subsequently intervened in the Arapahoe County Court action as
plaintiffs and proposed class representatives. We have filed a motion for summary judgment on all
counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a motion for additional time to conduct
discovery to enable them to respond to our motion. The Court granted a limited discovery period
which ended November 15, 2004. The Court is hearing discovery related motions and has set a
briefing schedule for the motion for summary judgment to begin 30 days after the ruling on those
motions. A trial date has not been set. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable
outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment Complaint

During October 2001, EchoStar received approximately $40.0 million from the sale of Enron
commercial paper to a third party broker. That commercial paper was ultimately purchased by Enron.
During November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York, against approximately 100 defendants, including us, who invested in
Enron’s commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 purchase of its
commercial paper was a fraudulent conveyance and voidable preference under bankruptcy laws. We
dispute these allegations. We typically invest in commercial paper and notes which are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations. At the time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was
considered to be high quality and considered to be a

very low risk. The defendants moved the Court
to dismiss the case on grounds that Enron’s complaint does not adequately state a legal claim,
which motion was denied but is subject to an appeal. It is too early to make an assessment of the
probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or
damages.

Bank One

During March 2004, Bank One, N.A. (“Bank One”) filed suit against us and one of our subsidiaries,
EchoStar Acceptance Corporation (“EAC”), in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio
alleging breach of a duty to indemnify. Bank One alleges that EAC is contractually required to
indemnify Bank One for a settlement it paid to consumers who entered private label credit card
agreements with Bank One to purchase satellite equipment in the late 1990s. Bank One alleges that
we entered into a guarantee wherein we agreed to pay any indemnity obligation incurred by Bank One.
During April 2004, we removed the case to federal court in Columbus, Ohio. We deny the
allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We filed a motion to dismiss the
Complaint which was granted in part and denied in part. The Court granted our motion, agreeing we
did not owe Bank One a duty to defend the underlying lawsuit. However, the Court denied the motion
in that Bank One will be allowed to attempt to prove that we owed Bank One a duty to indemnify.
The case is currently in discovery. A trial date has not been set. It is too early in the
litigation to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Church Communications Network, Inc.

During August 2004, Church Communications Network, Inc. (“CCN”) filed suit against us in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, asserting causes of action for breach
of contract, negligent misrepresentation, intentional and reckless misrepresentation, and
non-disclosure based on a 2003 contract with us. The action was transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of Colorado. The Court permitted CCN to amend its complaint to
assert the same claims based on a 2000 contract with us. We have filed motions for summary
judgment on all claims in the case. CCN has filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of
liability on its intentional and reckless misrepresentation claim. CCN claims approximately $20.0
million in damages plus punitive damages, attorney fees and costs. Discovery has been concluded
but no trial date has been set. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probable outcome
of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Vivendi

In January 2005, Vivendi Universal, S.A. (“Vivendi”), filed suit against us in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that we have anticipatorily
repudiated or are in breach of an alleged agreement between us and Vivendi pursuant to which we are
allegedly required to broadcast a music-video channel provided by Vivendi. Vivendi’s complaint
seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, and damages in an unspecified amount. On April 12, 2005,
the Court granted Vivendi’s motion for a preliminary injunction and directed us to broadcast the
music-video channel during the pendency of the litigation. In connection with that order, we have
also agreed to provide marketing support to Vivendi during the pendency of the litigation. In the
event that the Court ultimately determines that we have a contractual obligation to broadcast the
Vivendi music-video channel and that we are in breach of that obligation, we may be required to
continue broadcasting the Vivendi music-video channel and may also be subject to substantial
damages. We intend to vigorously defend this case.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

During March 2005, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against EchoStar, its chairman and
chief executive officer Charles W. Ergen and the members of its board of directors in the District
Court of Douglas County, Colorado. On November 7, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Dismissal
asking that the suit be dismissed without prejudice.

Other

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability
with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Reauthorization of Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act

SHVERA requires, among other things, that all local broadcast channels delivered by satellite to
any particular market be available from a single dish by June 8, 2006. We currently offer local
broadcast channels in 164 markets across the United States. In 38 of those markets a second dish
was previously required to receive some local channels in the market. While we have subsequently
reduced the number of markets where a second dish is necessary, we can not entirely eliminate the
second dish necessity in all markets absent full operability of EchoStar X.

In the event EchoStar X experiences any anomalies, satellite capacity limitations could force us to
move the local channels in some two dish markets to different satellites, requiring subscribers in
those markets to install a second or different dish to continue receiving their local broadcast
channels. We could be forced, in that event, to stop offering local channels in some of those
markets altogether. The transition of all local broadcast channels in a market to a single dish
could result in disruptions of service for a substantial number of our customers. Further, our
ability to timely comply with this requirement without incurring significant additional costs is
dependent on, among other things, the continued operation of our EchoStar V satellite at the 129
degree orbital
location until commencement of commercial operation of EchoStar X. EchoStar V or EchoStar X
anomalies could force us to cease offering local channels by satellite in many markets absent
regulatory relief from the single dish obligations. If impediments to our preferred transition
plan arise, it is possible that the costs of compliance with the single dish requirement could
exceed $100.0 million.

11. Segment Reporting

Financial Data by Business Unit

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information” (“SFAS 131”) establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments in annual financial statements of public business enterprises and requires that
those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports
issued to stockholders. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker(s)
of an enterprise. Under this definition we currently operate as two business units. The All Other
category consists of revenue and expenses from other operating segments for which the disclosure
requirements of SFAS 131 do not apply.

14. Related Party Transactions

We own 50% of NagraStar L.L.C. (“NagraStar”), a joint venture that is our exclusive provider of
security access devices. Nagra USA, a subsidiary of the Kudelski Group, owns the other 50% of
NagraStar. NagraStar purchases these security access devices from NagraCard SA, a Swiss company
which is also a subsidiary of the Kudelski Group. Because we are not required to consolidate
NagraStar, but we do have the ability to significantly influence its operating policies, we
accounted for our investment in NagraStar under the equity method of accounting for all periods
presented. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we purchased from NagraStar
approximately $121.4 million, $123.8 million and $68.4 million, respectively, for security access
devices. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, amounts payable to NagraStar totaled $3.9 million and
$22.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we were committed to purchase approximately
$35.5 million of security access devices from NagraStar.

15. Subsequent Events

$1.5 Billion Senior Notes Offering

On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our ten-year, 7 1/8% Senior
Notes due February 1, 2016 in a private placement in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. Interest on the notes will
be paid February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2006. The proceeds from the
sale of the notes were used to redeem our outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and are also
intended to be used for other general corporate purposes.

9 1/8% Senior Notes Redemption

Effective February 17, 2006, we redeemed the balance of our outstanding 9 1/8% Senior Notes due
2009. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the remaining principal
amount of the notes of approximately $442.0 million was redeemed at 104.563% of the principal
amount, for a total of approximately $462.1 million. The premium paid of approximately $20.1
million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $2.8 million, were recorded as
charges to earnings in February 2006.
