PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

DISH Network Corporation is the nation’s third largest pay-TV provider, with approximately 14.133 million customers across the United States as of December 31, 2010.  We were organized in 1995 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada and started offering DISH Network subscription television services in March 1996.

Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “DISH.”  Our principal executive offices are located at 9601 South Meridian Boulevard, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and our telephone number is (303) 723-1000.

On January 1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the “Spin-off”) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”).  DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies, and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other.  However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both companies is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer or by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing high-quality products, outstanding customer service, and great value.  We promote the DISH Network programming packages as providing our subscribers with a better “price-to-value” relationship than those available from other subscription television providers.  We believe that there continues to be unsatisfied demand for high-quality, reasonably priced television programming services.

·

High-Quality Products.

We offer a wide selection of local and national programming, featuring more national and local HD channels than most pay-TV providers.  We have been a technology leader in our industry, introducing award-winning DVRs, dual tuner receivers, 1080p video on demand, and external hard drives.  To maintain and enhance our competitiveness over the long term, we are promoting a suite of integrated products designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere, referred to as “TV Everywhere.”  Our TV Everywhere

™

service utilizes, among other things, online access and Slingbox “placeshifting” technology.

·

Outstanding Customer Service.

We strive to provide outstanding customer service by improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the reliability of our equipment, better educating our customers about our products and services, and resolving customer problems promptly and effectively when they arise.

·

Great Value.

We have historically been viewed as the low-cost provider in the pay-TV industry in the U.S. because we seek to offer the lowest everyday prices available to consumers after introductory promotions expire.

Products and Services

Programming.

We provide programming which includes more than 280 basic video channels, 60 Sirius Satellite Radio music channels, 30 premium movie channels, 35 regional and specialty sports channels, 2,800 local channels, 250 Latino and international channels, and 55 channels of pay-per-view content.  In addition, we offer local HD channels in more than 160 markets and 215 national HD channels.  Although we distribute over 2,800 local channels, a subscriber typically may only receive the local channels available in the subscriber’s home market.  As of December 31, 2010, we provided local channel coverage in standard definition to markets covering 100% of U.S.



TV households.  In addition, we provided local HD channels to markets representing approximately 94% of U.S. TV households.

Receiver Systems.

Our subscribers receive programming via equipment that includes a small satellite dish, digital set-top receivers, and remote controls.  Some of our advanced receiver models feature DVRs, HD capability, dual tuners (which allow independent viewing on two separate televisions) and Internet-protocol compatibility, which allows consumers to view movies and other content on their televisions via the Internet and a broadband connection.  We rely on EchoStar to design and manufacture all of our new receivers and certain related components.  See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”

DISHOnline.com.

DISHOnline.com gives DISH Network subscribers the ability to watch television programs, movies, and clips online at no additional charge with their paid subscription and compatible equipment.  DISHOnline.com offers more than 150,000 movies, television shows, clips and trailers.

DISH Remote Access.

DISH Network’s free remote access (“DISH Remote Access”) gives subscribers the ability to remotely manage their DVRs using compatible mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops through their broadband-connected receiver.

Google TV.

Google TV combines search capabilities and content from the Internet with our DISH Network subscription television services to give DISH Network subscribers the ability to search the Internet, check e-mail, interact with social media, and find additional online programming content while

simultaneously watching television.

Content Delivery

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers.

The principal digital broadcast operations facilities we use are EchoStar’s facilities located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona.  We also use five regional digital broadcast operations facilities owned and operated by EchoStar that allow us to maximize the use of the spot beam capabilities of certain owned and leased satellites.  Programming content is delivered to these facilities by fiber or satellite and processed, compressed, encrypted and then uplinked to satellites for delivery to consumers.

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a broadcast agreement pursuant to which EchoStar provides certain broadcast services to us, including teleport services such as transmission and downlinking, channel origination services, and channel management services for a period ending on January 1, 2012.  We may terminate channel origination services and channel management services for any reason and without any liability upon at least 60 days notice to EchoStar.  If we terminate teleport services for a reason other than EchoStar’s breach, we are obligated to pay EchoStar the aggregate amount of the remainder of the expected cost of providing the teleport services.

Satellites.

Our DISH Network programming is currently delivered to customers using satellites that operate in the “Ku” band portion of the microwave radio spectrum.  The Ku-band is divided into two spectrum segments.  The portion of the Ku-band that allows the use of higher power satellites – 12.2 to 12.7 GHz over the United States – is known as the Broadcast Satellite Service (“BSS”) band, which is also referred to as the Direct Broadcast Satellite (“DBS”) band.  The portion of the Ku-band that utilizes lower power satellites – 11.7 to 12.2 GHz over the United States – is known as the Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) band.

Most of our programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites.  To accommodate the more bandwidth-intensive HD programming and other needs, we continue to explore opportunities to expand our satellite capacity through the acquisition of new spectrum, the launching of more technologically advanced satellites, and the more efficient use of existing spectrum via, among other things, better modulation and compression technologies.

We own or lease capacity on 13 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator.  For further information concerning these satellites and satellite anomalies, please see the table and discussion under “Satellites” below.

Conditional Access System

.

Our conditional access system secures our programming content using encryption so that only paying customers can access our programming.  We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access



cards, called “smart cards,” or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (“Security Access Devices”).

Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult.  It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft.  During 2009, we completed the replacement of our Security Access Devices and re-secured our system.  We expect additional future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure.  We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system’s security is compromised.

Distribution Channels

While we offer receiver systems and programming through direct sales channels, a majority of our new subscriber acquisitions are generated through independent third parties such as small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies.  In general, we pay these independent third parties a mix of upfront and monthly incentives to solicit orders for our services.  In addition, we partner with telecommunications companies to bundle DISH Network programming with broadband and voice services on a single bill.

Competition

As of December 31, 2010, our 14.133 million subscribers represent approximately 15% of pay-TV subscribers in the United States.  We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and mobile devices.

·

Other Direct Broadcast Satellite Operators.

We compete directly with the DirecTV Group, Inc., or DirecTV, the largest satellite TV provider in the U.S. which had over 19.2 million subscribers at the end of 2010, representing approximately 20% of pay-TV subscribers.

·

Cable Television Companies.

We encounter substantial competition in the pay-TV industry from numerous cable television companies that operate via franchise licenses across the U.S.  According to the National Cable & Telecommunications Association’s 2009 Industry Overview, 98% of the 130 million U.S. housing units are passed by cable.  More than 95 million households subscribe to a pay-TV service and approximately 63% of pay-TV subscribers receive their programming from a cable operator.  Cable companies are typically able to bundle their video services with broadband Internet access and voi
ce services and many have significant investments in companies that provide programming content.

·

Telecommunications Companies

.  Large telecommunications companies have upgraded older copper wire lines with fiber optic lines in their larger markets.  These fiber optic lines provide high capacity bandwidth, enabling telecommunications companies to offer video content that can be bundled with their broadband Internet access and voice services.  In particular, AT&T and Verizon have built fiber-optic based networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas.

·

Internet Delivered Video.

We face competition from content providers who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet.  Programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved.  Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video entertainment and information in response to this emerging digital media competition could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.

·

Wireless Mobile Video.

We also expect to face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings.  We expect mobile video offerings will likely become more prevalent in the marketplace as wireless telecommunications providers implement the fourth generation of wireless communications.



Acquisition of New Subscribers

We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, retailer incentives, equipment and installation.  In addition, customer promotions to acquire new subscribers result in less revenue to us over the promotional period.  While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscriptions, there can be no assurance that we will.  We deploy business rules such as credit requirements and contractual commitments, and we strive to provide outstanding customer service, to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their DISH Network service over longer periods of time.  Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period.

Advertising

.

We use print, radio, television and Internet media, on a local and national basis to motivate potential subscribers to call DISH Network, visit our website or contact independent third party retailers.

Retailer Incentives.

We pay retailers an upfront incentive for each new subscriber they bring to DISH Network and, for certain retailers, we pay small monthly incentives for up to 60 months provided, among other things, the customer continuously subscribes to qualified programming.

Equipment

.

We incur significant upfront costs to provide our new subscribers with in-home equipment, including advanced HD and DVR receivers, which most of our new subscribers lease from us.  While we seek to recoup these upfront equipment costs mostly through monthly fees, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective.  In addition, upon deactivation of a subscriber we may refurbish and redeploy their equipment which lowers future upfront costs.  However, our ability to capitalize on these cost savings may be limited as technological advances and consumer demand for new features may render the returned equipment obsolete.

Installation.

We incur significant upfront costs to install satellite dishes and receivers in the homes of our new customers.

New Customer Promotions.

We often offer free programming and/or promotional pricing during introductory periods for new subscribers.  While such promotional activities have an economic cost and reduce our subscriber-related revenue, they are not included in our definitions of subscriber acquisition costs or the SAC metric.

Customer Retention

We incur significant costs to retain our existing customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers.  As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation.  In certain circumstances, we also offer free programming and/or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment.  A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move.  Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.

Customer Service

Customer Service Centers

.

We use both internally-operated and outsourced customer service centers to handle calls from prospective and existing customers.  We strive to answer customer calls promptly and to resolve issues effectively on the first call.  We intend to better use the Internet and other applications to provide our customers with more self-service capabilities over time.

Installation and Other In-Home Service Operations

.

High

-

quality installations, upgrades, and in-home repairs are critical to providing good customer service.  Such in-home service is performed by both DISH Network employees and a network of independent contractors and includes, among other things, priority technical support, replacement equipment, cabling and power surge repairs for a monthly fee.

Subscriber Management

.

We presently use, and depend on, CSG Systems International, Inc.’s software system for the majority of DISH Network subscriber billing and related functions.



New Business Opportunities

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities, improve or sustain our competitive position, or otherwise offer growth opportunities.  We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services.

In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009.  To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly.  Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements.  We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance.

SATELLITES

Most of our programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites.  We continue to explore opportunities to expand our available satellite capacity through the use of other available spectrum.  Increasing our available spectrum is particularly important as more bandwidth intensive HD programming is produced and to address new video and data applications consumers may desire in the future.  We currently utilize satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator detailed in the table below.

(1)

See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our Related Party Agreements.

(2)

We lease a portion of the capacity on these satellites.

(3)

Leased on a month to month basis.



EchoStar XIV

.

Our EchoStar XIV satellite was launched on March 20, 2010 and commenced commercial operations at the 119 degree orbital location during May 2010.  EchoStar XIV has both spot beam capabilities and the ability to provide service to the entire continental United States (“CONUS”) that has allowed us, among other things, to expand our HD offerings.

EchoStar XV

.

Our EchoStar XV satellite was launched on July 10, 2010 and commenced commercial operations at the 61.5 degree orbital location during August 2010.  EchoStar XV is a CONUS satellite that has allowed us, among other things, to expand our HD offerings.  EchoStar XV is expected to be used as an in-orbit spare when EchoStar XVI commences commercial operations during the second half of 2012.

Satellites under Construction

We have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from EchoStar that are currently under construction.

·

QuetzSat-1.

During 2008, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease 24 DBS transponders on QuetzSat-1, a Mexican DBS satellite being constructed by SES Latin America S.A. (“SES”).  QuetzSat-1 is expected to be launched during the second half of 2011 and operate at the 77 degree orbital location.  Upon expiration of the initial term, we have the option to renew the transponder service agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end-of-life of the QuetzSat-1 satellite.  Upon a launch failure, in-orbit failure o
r end-of-life of the QuetzSat-1 satellite, and in certain other circumstances, we have certain rights to receive service from EchoStar on a replacement satellite.  QuetzSat-1 will enable better bandwidth utilization, provide back-up protection for our existing offerings, and could allow us to offer other value-added services.

·

EchoStar XVI

.  During 2009, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease all of the capacity on EchoStar XVI, a DBS satellite.  EchoStar XVI will replace the satellites currently at the 61.5 degree orbital location and will allow us to offer other value-added services.  We will lease all of the satellite capacity from EchoStar on EchoStar XVI after its service commencement date and this lease generally terminates upon the earlier of:  (i) the end of life or replacement of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails; (iii) the date the transponder(s)&n
bsp;on which service is being provided under the agreement fails; or (iv) ten years following the actual service commencement date.  Upon expiration of the initial term, we have the option to renew on a year-to-year basis through the end of life of the satellite.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew this agreement will be exercised.  EchoStar XVI is expected to be launched during the second half of 2012.

Satellite Anomalies

Operation of our programming service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer.  Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming, particularly by expanding local HD coverage and offering more HD national channels.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.  Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Prior to 2010, certain satellites in our fleet experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful life and/or commercial operation.  There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not further impact the remaining useful life and/or commercial operation of any of these satellites.  See “Long-Lived Satellite Assets” below for further discussion of evaluation of impairment and Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail.  We do



not anticipate carrying insurance for any of the in-orbit satellites that we use, and we will bear the risk associated with any in-orbit satellite failures.  Recent developments with respect to certain of our satellites are discussed below.

Owned Satellites

EchoStar VII.

EchoStar VII, which is being used as an in-orbit spare, was designed with four gyros, of which three are required to properly control the positioning of the satellite.  During October 2010, EchoStar VII experienced an anomaly which caused one of its gyros to temporarily stop functioning.  Testing during December 2010 confirmed that this gyro is functioning again.  In addition, during July 2010, EchoStar VII experienced a thruster anomaly.  Thrusters control spacecraft location and maintain spacecraft pointing.  While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years or impact commercial operation of the satellite, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not reduce its useful life or impact its comme
rcial operation.

EchoStar X

.

EchoStar X was designed with 49 spot beams which use up to 42 active 140 watt traveling wave tube amplifiers (“TWTAs”) and 24 solar array circuits, of which approximately 22 are required to assure full power for the original minimum 12-year useful life of the satellite.  During May and September of 2010, EchoStar X experienced anomalies which affected seven solar array circuits reducing the number of functional solar array circuits to 17.  While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years or impact commercial operation of the satellite based on the satellite’s current configuration, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not red
uce its useful life or impact its commercial operation.

Leased Satellites

EchoStar VI.

EchoStar VI was designed with 108 solar array strings, of which approximately 102 are required to assure full power availability for the original minimum 12-year useful life of the satellite.  During March and August of 2010,

EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of 24 solar array strings, reducing the number of functional solar array strings to 84. While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years, commercial operation has been impacted and there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not reduce its useful life or further impact its commercial operation.  The satellite was designed to operate 32 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16 DBS transponder
s operating at approximately 250 watts per channel.  The power reduction resulting from the solar array failures currently limits us to operating 24 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 12 DBS transponders operating at approximately 250 watts per channel.  The number of transponders to which power can be provided is expected to decline in the future at the rate of approximately one transponder every three years.

EchoStar VIII

.  EchoStar VIII was designed to operate 32 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 DBS transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel.  EchoStar VIII was also designed with spot-beam technology.  This satellite has experienced several anomalies prior to 2011, but none have reduced its useful life or impacted its commercial operation.  During January 2011, the satellite experienced an anomaly, which temporarily disrupted electrical power to some components causing an interruption of broadcast service.  Testing is being performed to determine if this anomaly will reduce the satellite’s useful life or impact its commercial operations.  There can be no assurance that this anomaly or any future anomalies will n
ot reduce its useful life or impact its commercial operation.

Long-Lived Satellite Assets

We evaluate our satellite fleet for impairment as one asset group and test for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  While certain of the anomalies discussed above, and previously disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of an individual satellite, based on the redundancy designed within each satellite and considering the asset grouping, these anomalies are not considered to be significant events that would require evaluation for impairment recognition.  Unless and until a specific satellite is abandoned or otherwise determined to have no service potential, the net carrying amount related to the satellite would not be written off.



GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

DBS operators are subject to significant government regulation, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and foreign, state and local authorities.  Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these entities could result in the suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore, the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.  If we become subject to new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of e
xisting regulations or legislation that govern Internet network neutrality, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.  The manner in which legislation governing Internet network neutrality may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation in the United States is not intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting the satellite and video programming distribution industries.  Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change our industry to varying degrees.  We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations.

FCC Regulation under the Communications Act

FCC Jurisdiction over our Operations.

The Communications Act gives the FCC broad authority to regulate the operations of satellite companies.  Specifically, the Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relating to communications satellite operations:

·

the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations, the licensing of satellites and earth stations, the granting of related authorizations, and evaluation of the fitness of a company to be a licensee;

·

approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations or the replacement of an existing satellite with a new satellite;

·

ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of such assignments, licenses, authorizations and approvals; including required timetables for construction and operation of satellites;

·

avoiding interference with other radio frequency emitters; and

·

ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations.

To obtain FCC satellite licenses and authorizations, satellite operators must satisfy strict legal, technical and financial qualification requirements.  Once issued, these licenses and authorizations are subject to a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of ongoing due diligence obligations, construction milestones, and various reporting requirements.  Necessary federal approval of these applications may not be granted, may not be granted in a timely manner, or may be granted subject to conditions which may be cumbersome.

Overview of our Satellites, Authorizations and Contractual Rights for Satellite Capacity.

Our satellites are located in orbital positions, or slots, that are designated by their western longitude.  An orbital position describes both a physical location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band.  Each DBS orbital position has 500 MHz of available Ku-band spectrum that is divided into 32 frequency channels.  Through digital compression technology, we can currently transmit between nine and 13 standard definition digital video channels per DBS frequency channel.  Several of our satellites also include spot-beam technology which enables us to increase the number of markets where we provide local channe
ls, but reduces the number of video channels that could otherwise be offered across the entire United States.



The FCC has licensed us to operate a total of 82 DBS frequencies at the following orbital locations:

·

21 DBS frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to CONUS;

·

29 DBS frequencies at the 110 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to CONUS; and

·

32 DBS frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to the Western United States.

We currently do not have any satellites positioned at the 148 degree orbital location as a result of the retirement of EchoStar V.  While we have requested the necessary approval from the FCC for the continued use of this orbital location, there can be no assurance that the FCC will determine that our proposed future use of this orbital location complies fully with all licensing requirements.

In addition, we currently lease or have entered into agreements to lease capacity on satellites using the following spectrum at the following orbital locations:

·

500 MHz of Ku-band FSS spectrum that is divided into 32 frequency channels (each of which is capable of transmitting between five and eight standard definition digital video channels) at the 118.7 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian FSS slot that is capable of providing service to the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii;

·

32 DBS frequencies at the 129 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian DBS slot that is capable of providing service to most of the United States;

·

32 DBS frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to most of the United States;

·

24 DBS frequencies at the 77 degree orbital location, which is a Mexican DBS slot that is capable of providing service to most of the United States and Mexico; and

·

32 DBS frequencies at the 72.7 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian DBS slot that is capable of providing service to the United States.  We and EchoStar are currently receiving service on 23 of these DBS transponders and will receive service on the remaining nine DBS transponders over a phase-in period that will be completed in 2012.

We also have month-to-month FSS capacity available from EchoStar on satellites located at the 105 and 121 degree orbital locations.

700 MHz Spectrum

.  In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009.  To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly.  Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements.  We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance.

Other Wireless Spectrum

.  In 2010, we purchased all of South.com L.L.C., which is an entity that holds Multichannel Video Distribution & Data Service (“MVDDS”) licenses in 37 markets in the United States.

Duration of our DBS Satellite Licenses

.  Generally speaking, all of our satellite licenses are subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC.  The term of each of our DBS licenses is ten years.  Our licenses are currently set to expire at various times.  In addition, our special temporary authorization is granted for a period of only 180 days or less, subject again to possible renewal by the FCC.  Generally, our FCC licenses and special temporary authorization have been renewed by the FCC on a routine basis but, there can be no assurance that the FCC will continue to do so.

Opposition and other Risks to our Licenses

.  Several third parties have opposed, and we expect them to continue to oppose, some of our FCC satellite authorizations and pending requests to the FCC for extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses.  In addition, we may not have fully complied with all of the FCC reporting, filing and other requirements in connection with our satellite authorizations.  Consequently, it is possible the FCC could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses.



FCC Actions Affecting our Licenses and Applications

.  A number of our other applications have been denied or dismissed without prejudice by the FCC, or remain pending.  We cannot be sure that the FCC will grant any of our outstanding applications, or that the authorizations, if granted, will not be subject to onerous conditions.  Moreover, the cost of building, launching and insuring a satellite can be as much as $300 million or more.  If we are unable to construct and launch any of the satellites for which we have requested authorizations, it may result in further FCC restrictions on our operations.

4.5 Degree Spacing Tweener Satellites

.  The FCC has proposed to allow so-called “tweener” DBS operations — DBS satellites operating from orbital locations 4.5 degrees (half of the usual nine degrees) away from other DBS satellites.  The FCC has already granted authorizations to Spectrum Five and EchoStar for tweener satellites at the 114.5 and 86.5 degree orbital locations, respectively.  Certain tweener operations, as proposed, could cause harmful interference into our service and constrain our future operations.  The FCC has not completed its rulemaking on the operating and service rules for tweener satellites.

Interference from Other Services Sharing Satellite Spectrum

.  The FCC has adopted rules that allow non-geostationary orbit fixed satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency band as DBS and Ku-band-based fixed satellite services.  The FCC has also authorized the use of MVDDS in the DBS band.  MVDDS licenses were auctioned in 2004.  Despite regulatory provisions to protect DBS operations from harmful interference, there can be no assurance that operations by other satellites or terrestrial communication services in the DBS band will not interfere with our DBS operations and adversely affect our business.

International Satellite Competition and Interference

.  DirecTV and Spectrum Five have obtained FCC authority to provide service to the United States from a Canadian DBS orbital slot, and EchoStar has obtained authority to provide service to the United States from both a Mexican and a Canadian DBS orbital slot.  Further, we have also received authority to do the same from a Canadian DBS orbital slot at 129 degrees and a Canadian FSS orbital slot at 118.7 degrees.  The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the U.S. from additional foreign slots may permit additional competition against us from other satellite providers.  It may also provide a means by which to increase our available satellite capacity in the United States.  In addition, a number of administrations, such as Great Brita
in and the Netherlands, have requested to add orbital locations serving the U.S. close to our licensed slots.  Such operations could cause harmful interference to our satellites and constrain our future operations.

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services

.  The FCC imposes different rules for “subscription” and “broadcast” services.  We believe that because we offer a subscription programming service, we are not subject to many of the regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees.  However, we cannot be certain whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we be treated as a broadcaster.  If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast licensee, it could require us to comply with all regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees, which in certain respects are subject to more burdensome regulation than subscription television service providers.

Public Interest Requirements

.  The FCC imposes certain public interest obligations on our DBS licenses.  These obligations require us to set aside four percent of our channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial programming for which we must charge programmers below-cost rates and for which we may not impose additional charges on subscribers.  The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (“STELA”) requires the FCC to decrease this set-aside to 3.5 percent for satellite carriers who provide retransmission of state public affairs networks in 15 states and are otherwise qualified.  The FCC, however, has not yet determined whether we qualify for this decrease in set-aside.  The obligation to provide noncommercial programming may displace programming for which we could 
earn commercial rates and could adversely affect our financial results.  We cannot be sure that, if the FCC were to review our methodology for processing public interest carriage requests, computing the channel capacity we must set aside or determining the rates that we charge public interest programmers, it would find them in compliance with the public interest requirements.

Separate Security, Plug and Play

.

Cable companies are required by law to separate the security from the other functionality of their set-top boxes.  Set-top boxes used by DBS providers are not currently subject to such separate security requirement.  However, the FCC is considering a possible expansion of that requirement to DBS set-top boxes.  Also, the FCC has adopted the so-called “plug and play” standard for compatibility between digital television sets and cable systems.  That standard was developed through negotiations involving the cable and



consumer electronics industries, but not us.  The FCC is considering various proposals to establish two-way digital cable “plug and play” rules.  That proceeding also asks about means to incorporate all pay-TV providers into its “plug and play” rules.  The cable industry and consumer electronics companies have reached a “tru2way” commercial arrangement to resolve many of the outstanding issues in this docket.  We cannot predict whether the FCC will impose rules on our DBS operations that are based on cable system architectures or the private cable/consumer electronics tru2way commercial arrangement.  Complying with the separate security and other “plug and play” requirements would require potentially costly modifications to our set-top boxes and operations.  We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this FCC proceeding.

Retransmission Consent.

The Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network stations that do not elect “must carry” status, as required by the Communications Act.  If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals.  This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals.  While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, there remain stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement. 
 We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms (or at all) upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term.  In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to attempt to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations.  These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming.  Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing.  We may be unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Digital HD Carry-One, Carry-All Requirement.

To provide any full-power local broadcast signal in any market, we are required to retransmit all qualifying broadcast signals in that market (“carry-one, carry-all”).  The FCC has adopted digital carriage rules that require DBS providers to phase in carry-one, carry-all obligations with respect to the carriage of full-power broadcasters’ HD signals by February 2013 in markets in which DISH Network elects to provide local channels in HD.  In addition, STELA has imposed accelerated HD carriage requirements for noncommercial educational stations on DBS providers that do not have a certain contractual relationship with a certain number of 
such stations.  DISH Network has entered into an agreement with a number of PBS stations to comply with the requirements.  DISH Network has also challenged the constitutionality of this provision but has not prevailed in its effort to obtain temporary injunctive relief.  The carriage of additional HD signals on our DBS system could cause us to experience significant capacity constraints and prevent us from carrying additional popular national programs and/or carrying those national programs in HD.

In addition, there is a pending rulemaking before the FCC regarding whether to require DBS providers to carry all broadcast stations in a local market in both standard definition and HD if they carry any station in that market in both standard definition and HD.  If we were required to carry multiple versions of each broadcast station, we would have to dedicate more of our finite satellite capacity to each broadcast station.  We cannot predict the outcome or timing of that rulemaking process.

Distant Signals

.

Pursuant to STELA, we have been able to obtain a waiver of a court injunction that previously prevented us from retransmitting certain distant network signals under a statutory copyright license.  Because of that waiver, we may once again provide distant network signals to eligible subscribers.  To qualify for that waiver, we are required to provide local service in all 210 local markets in the U.S. on an ongoing basis.  This condition poses a significant strain on our capacity.  Moreover, we may lose that waiver if we are found to have failed to provide local service in any of the 210 local markets.  If we lose the waiver, the injunction could be reinstated.  Furthermore, depending on the sev
erity of the failure, we may also be subject to other sanctions, which may include, among other things, damages.  Our compliance with certain conditions for the waiver is subject to examination and review.

Dependence on Cable Act for Program Access

.

We purchase a large percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers.  The provisions of the Cable Act of 1992, as amended (“Cable Act”), prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable-affiliated programmers, were extended for another five-year period in September 2007.  Cable companies appealed the FCC’s decision, and while that decision was upheld by the United States Court



of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) in March 2010, that court indicated if the market continues to evolve, it is expected that the exclusivity prohibition may no longer be necessary.  Any change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming could adversely affect our ability to acquire cable-affiliated programming at all or to acquire programming on a cost-effective basis.  As a result, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access on nondiscriminatory terms to programming from programmers that are affiliated with cable system operators.  In the case of certain types of programming affiliated with Comcast, Time-Warner Cable, and Liberty, the terms of access to the programming are subject to arbitratio
n if we and the programmer cannot reach agreement on terms, subject to FCC review.  We cannot be sure that this procedure will result in favorable terms for us or that the FCC conditions that establish this procedure will be allowed to expire on their own terms.

In addition, affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite.  The FCC recently held that new denials of such service are unfair if they have the purpose or effect of significantly hindering us from providing programming to consumers.  However, we cannot be sure that we can prevail in a complaint related to such programming and gain access to it.  Our continuing failure to access such programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these cable providers.

MDU Exclusivity

.  The FCC has found that cable companies should not be permitted to have exclusive relationships with multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment buildings).  In May 2009, the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC’s decision.  While the FCC requested comments in November 2007 on whether DBS and Private Cable Operators (“PCOs”) should be prohibited from having similar relationships with multiple dwelling units, it has yet to make a formal decision.  If the cable exclusivity ban were to be extended to DBS providers, our ability to serve these types of buildings and communities would be adversely affected.  We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the FCC’s consideration of this proposal.

Net Neutrality.

The FCC has recently imposed rules of nondiscrimination and transparency upon wireline broadband providers.  While this decision provides certain protection from discrimination by wireline broadband providers against our distribution of video content via the Internet, it may still permit wireline broadband providers to provide certain services over their wireline broadband network that are not subject to these requirements.  Although the FCC imposed similar transparency requirements on wireless broadband providers, it declined to impose the same nondiscrimination rule.  Instead, wireless broadband Internet providers are prohibited from blocking websites and applications that compete with voice and video telephony services.  The FCC’s net neutrality rules have 
been challenged in federal court and could be overturned if those challenges are successful.  Furthermore, it is uncertain how these requirements may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these rules on our ability to distribute our video content via the Internet.

Comcast/NBC Universal Transaction

.  Comcast and General Electric have joined their programming properties, including NBC, Bravo and many others, in a venture to be controlled by Comcast.  In January 2011, the transaction was approved by the FCC and the Department of Justice.  The FCC conditioned its approval on, among other things, Comcast complying with the terms of the FCC’s recent order on network neutrality (even if that order is vacated by judicial or legislative action) and Comcast licensing its affiliated content to us, other traditional pay-TV providers and certain providers of video services over the Internet on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, including, among others, price.  If Comcast does not license its affiliated content to us on fair and nondiscriminatory
 terms and conditions, we can seek arbitration and continue to carry such content while the arbitration is pending.  However, it is uncertain how these conditions may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these conditions.

The International Telecommunication Union

Our DBS system also must conform to the ITU broadcasting satellite service plan for Region 2 (which includes the United States).  If any of our operations are not consistent with this plan, the ITU will only provide authorization on a non-interference basis pending successful modification of the plan or the agreement of all affected administrations to the non-conforming operations.  Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its broadcasting satellite service plan to include the technical parameters of DBS applicants’ operations, our satellites, along with those of other DBS operators, must not cause harmful electrical interference with other assignments that are in conformance with the



plan.  Further, certain of our DBS satellites are not presently entitled to any protection from other satellites that are in conformance with the plan.

Export Control Regulation

The delivery of satellites and related technical information for the purpose of launch by foreign launch services providers is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements.

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services that we offer.  In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes on intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims.  If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position.

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our products or services may potentially infringe.  In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first) and, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications of which we are not aware.  Further, the process of determining definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid often involves expensive and protracted litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual property licenses or the availability and cost of any such licenses.  Those costs, and their impact on our results of operations, could be material.  Damages in patent infringement cases may also be trebled in certain circumstances.  To the extent that we are required to pay unanticipated royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our liquidity and operating results.  We are currently defending multiple patent infringement actions.  We cannot be certain the courts will conclude these companies do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesi
gn our products to avoid infringement.  See “Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.”

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.  These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management.  We attempt to maintain compliance with all such requirements.  We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in 2011 or 2012.  Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time.  Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

SEGMENT REPORTING DATA AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA

Following the Spin-off, we operate in only one reportable segment, the DISH Network segment, which provides a DBS subscription television service in the United States.

EMPLOYEES

We had approximately 22,000 employees at December 31, 2010, most of whom are located in the United States.  We generally consider relations with our employees to be good.



Approximately 64 employees in three of our field offices have voted to have a union represent them in contract negotiations.  While we are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements, we are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements at these offices.

Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also become important factors that affect us.

If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We face intense and increasing competition from satellite and cable television providers, telecommunications companies and providers of

video content via the Internet, especially as the pay-TV industry matures,

which may require us to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber acquisitions and higher subscriber churn.

Our business is focused on providing pay-TV services and we have traditionally competed against satellite and cable television providers, some of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.  Many of these competitors offer video services bundled with broadband, telephony services, HD offerings, interactive services and video on demand services that consumers may find attractive.  Moreover, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies and others may result in, among other things, greater financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling television, broadband and telephone services in competition with our services.  We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber 
bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services.  In addition, because other pay-TV providers may be seeking to attract a greater proportion of their new subscribers from our existing subscriber base we may be required to increase retention spending.

Competition has intensified in recent quarters as the pay-TV industry matures and the growth of video being delivered via the Internet and fiber-based pay-TV services offered by telecommunications companies such as Verizon and AT&T continues.  These fiber-based pay-TV services have significantly greater capacity, enabling the telecommunications companies to offer substantial HD programming content as well as bundled services.  In addition, the recent growth of video content being delivered via the Internet has made alternatives to traditional pay-TV services available to customers.  This increasingly competitive environment may require us to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber acquisitions and higher subscriber churn.

Competition from digital media companies that provide/facilitate the delivery of video content via the Internet, could materially adversely affect us.

Our business is focused on pay-TV services, and we face competition from providers of digital media, including those companies that offer online services distributing movies, television shows and other video programming.  Moreover, new technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face with respect to video services.  For example, online platforms that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming compete with our pay-TV services.  These online platforms may cause our subscribers to disconnect our services.  In addition, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us through these online platforms, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us.  Some of these companies have g
reater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.  In particular, programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband and wireless networks have improved.  In addition, consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices.  These technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video content could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.



If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms,

we would be subject to substantial liability and would be prohibited from offering DVR functionality that would result in a significant loss of subscribers

and

place us at a significant disadvantage to our competitors.

In June 2009, the United States District Court granted Tivo’s motion for contempt finding that our next-generation DVRs continue to infringe Tivo’s intellectual property and awarded Tivo an additional $103 million in supplemental damages and interest for the period from September 2006 through April 2008.  In September 2009, the District Court partially granted Tivo’s motion for contempt sanctions.  In partially granting Tivo’s motion for contempt sanctions, the District Court awarded $2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the period from April 2008 to July 2009 (as compared to the award for supplemental damages for the prior period from September 2006 to April 2008, which was based on an assumed $1.25 per DVR subscriber per month).  By the District Court’s estimation, the total award for the period from April 2008 to July 
2009 is approximately $200 million (the enforcement of the award has been stayed by the District Court pending DISH Network’s appeal of the underlying June 2009 contempt order).  As previously disclosed, we increased our accrual for the Tivo litigation to reflect both the supplemental damages award for the period September 2006 to April 2008 and for the estimated cost of alleged software infringement for the period from April 2008 through June 2009.

If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers.  Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services.  The 
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court’s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant.  Additionally, the awards described above do not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009.  In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest.  Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital.  Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives.  We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions
 may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings.

If we are successful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo’s patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material.  We could also have to pay substantial additional damages.

Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court.  We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit.  EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar’s $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar’s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote
ntial new alternative technology.



If we do not improve our operational performance and customer satisfaction, our gross new subscriber additions may decrease and our subscriber churn may increase.

If we are unable to improve our operational performance and customer satisfaction, we may experience a decrease in gross new subscriber additions and an increase in churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  To address our operational inefficiencies, we need to continue to make significant investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations.  These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run.  We cannot, however, be certain that our spending will ultimately be successful in addressing our operational inefficiencies.  In the meantime, we may continue to inc
ur higher costs as a result of both our operational inefficiencies and levels of spending.  While we believe that these costs will be outweighed by longer-term benefits, there can be no assurance when or if we will realize these benefits at all.

If DISH Network gross new subscriber additions decrease, or if subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs or retention costs increase, our financial performance will be adversely affected.

We have not always met and may continue to fail to meet our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain third party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service.

Most of these factors have affected both gross new subscriber additions as well as existing subscriber churn.  Our future gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn may continue to be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations.

We may incur increased costs to acquire new and retain existing subscribers.  Our subscriber acquisition costs could increase as a result of increased spending for advertising and the installation of more HD and DVR receivers, which are generally more expensive than other receivers.  Meanwhile, retention costs may be driven higher by a faster rate of upgrading existing subscribers’ equipment to HD and DVR receivers.  Additionally, certain of our promotions, including, among others, pay-in-advance, allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers.  These subscribers typically churn at a higher rate.

Our subscriber acquisition costs and our subscriber retention costs can vary significantly from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow.  Any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Economic weakness, including higher unemployment and reduced consumer spending, may adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our business.

A substantial majority of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by sustained economic weakness and uncertainty.  Economic weakness and uncertainty persisted during 2010.  Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by sustained economic weakness and uncertainty, including the effect of wavering consumer confidence, high unemployment and other factors that may adversely affect the pay-TV industry.  In particular, economic weakness and uncertainty could result in the following:

·

Fewer gross new subscriber additions and increased churn.

We could face fewer gross new subscriber additions and increased churn due to, among other things:  (i) the sustained weak housing market in the United States combined with lower discretionary spending; (ii) increased price competition for our products and services; and (iii) the potential loss of retailers, who generate a significant portion of our new subscribers, because many of them are small businesses that are more susceptible to the negative
 effects of economic weakness.  In particular, subscriber churn may increase with respect to subscribers who purchase



our lower tier programming packages and who may be more sensitive to sustained economic weakness, including, among others, our pay-in-advance subscribers.

·

Lower average monthly revenue per subscriber (“ARPU”)

.

Our ARPU could be negatively impacted by more aggressive introductory offers by our competitors and the growth of video content being delivered via the Internet.  Furthermore, due to lower levels of disposable income, our customers may downgrade to lower cost programming packages, elect not to purchase premium services or pay per view movies or may disconnect our services and choose to replace them with less expensive alternatives such as video content de
livered via the Internet, including, among others, video on demand.

·

Higher subscriber acquisition and retention costs

.

Our profits may be adversely affected by increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs necessary to attract and retain subscribers during a period of economic weakness.

Programming expenses are increasing and could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.

Our programming costs currently represent the largest component of our total expense and we expect these costs to continue to increase.  The pay-TV industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially local broadcast channels and sports programming.  Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.

When offering new programming, or upon expiration of existing contracts, programming suppliers have historically attempted to increase the rates they charge us for programming.  We expect this practice to continue, which, if successful, would increase our programming costs.  As a result, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms.

In addition, increases in programming costs could cause us to increase the rates that we charge our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service.  Therefore, we may be unable to pass increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our subscribers and, if we lose access to this programming, our gross new subscriber additions may decline and subscriber churn may increase.

We depend on third parties to provide us with programming services.  Our programming agreements have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to several years and contain various renewal and cancellation provisions.  We may not be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at all, and these agreements may be canceled prior to expiration of their original term.  Certain programmers have, in the past, temporarily limited our access to their programming.  For example, during the fourth quarter of 2010, our gross subscriber activations and subscriber churn were negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers.  If we are unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties cancel the agreements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that s
uch substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming.  In addition, loss of access to programming could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our gross subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate.

We may be required to make substantial additional investments to maintain competitive programming offerings.

We believe that the availability and extent of HD programming continues to be a significant factor in consumers’ choice among pay-TV providers.  Other pay-TV providers may have more successfully marketed and promoted their HD programming packages and may also be better equipped and have greater resources to increase their HD offerings to respond to increasing consumer demand for this content.  In addition, even though it remains a small portion of the market, consumer demand for 3D televisions and programming will likely increase in the future.  We may be required to make substantial additional investments in infrastructure to respond to competitive pressure to



deliver additional programming, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with programming offerings from other pay-TV providers.

Technology in our industry changes rapidly and could cause our services and products to become obsolete.

We may have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment and make substantial investments in our infrastructure

t

o remain competitive.

Technology in the pay-TV industry changes rapidly as new technologies are developed, which could cause our services and products to become obsolete.  Our operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to introduce new products and services on a timely basis and to reduce costs of our existing products and services.  We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner.  The success of new product development depends on many factors, including proper identification of customer need, cost, timely completion and introduction, differentiation from offerings of competitors and market acceptance.  New technologies could also create new competitors for us.  For instance, we face increasing consumer demand for the delivery of digital video services via
 the Internet, including providing TV Everywhere.  We expect to continue to face increased threats from companies who use the Internet to deliver digital video services as the speed and quality of broadband and wireless networks continues to improve.

We and our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments.  If the new technologies on which we intend to focus our research and development investments fail to achieve acceptance in the marketplace, our competitive position could be negatively impacted causing a reduction in our revenues and earnings.  We may also be at a competitive disadvantage in developing and introducing complex new products and technologies because of the substantial costs we may incur in making these products or technologies available across our installed base of over 14 million subscribers.  For example, our competitors could use proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior.  Further, after we have incurred substantial costs, one or more of the technologies under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners, could become obsolet
e prior to it being widely adopted.  In addition, delays in the delivery of components or other unforeseen problems associated with our technology may occur that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new services and remain competitive.

Technological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees.  We rely on EchoStar to design and develop set-top boxes with advanced features and functionality and solutions for providing digital video services via the Internet.  If EchoStar is unable to attract and retain appropriately technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, our competitive position depends in part on our ability to offer new subscribers and upgrade existing subscribers with more advanced equipment, such as receivers with DVR and HD technology and by otherwise making additional infrastructure investments, such as those related to our information technology and call centers.  Furthermore, the continued demand for HD programming continues to require investments in additional satellite capacity.  We may not be able to pass on to our subscribers the entire cost of these upgrades and infrastructure investments.

Increased distribution of video content via the Internet could expose us to regulatory risk.

As a result of recent updates to certain of our programming agreements which allow us to, among other things, deliver certain authenticated content via the Internet, we are increasingly distributing content to our subscribers via the Internet.  The ability to continue this strategy may depend in part on the FCC’s success in implementing rules prohibiting discrimination of content that is distributed over the networks owned by broadband and wireless Internet providers.  For more information, see “Item 1.  Business — Government Regulations — FCC Regulations under the Communications Act — Net Neutrality” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.

We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services.  Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to de
fend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our business.  Moreover, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business.

The capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures.  Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives.  Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.  For example, during 2011, we expect to begin implementing new interactive voice response, scheduling of in-home service and customer care systems.  During 2011, we also plan to begin develop
ment and testing of a new billing system that is likely to be installed in 2012.  We are relying on third parties for developing key components of these systems and ongoing service after their implementation.  Third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control.  Interruption, failure and/or delay in transitioning to any of these new systems could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our services, retain our current subscribers and attract new subscribers.  As a result, an unsuccessful transition to these new systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact.  If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses.

We may need additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.

We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, continue investing in our business, construct and launch new satellites, and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions.

Furthermore, weakness in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.  In addition, sustained economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund these investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions.  As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to



accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.

If Voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.

In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings (“Voom”) filed a  lawsuit  against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service. At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement.    The Court denied Voom’s request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment.  Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions.  On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom’s motions for discovery sanctions.  The Court’s decision
 provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial.  We appealed the grant of Voom’s motion for discovery sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages.  If we are unsuccessful in our suit with Voom, we may be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.

A portion of our investment portfolio is invested in securities that have experienced limited or no liquidity and may not be immediately accessible to support our financing needs.

A portion of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities, mortgage backed securities, and strategic investments, and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity.  Liquidity in the markets for these investments has been adversely impacted.  If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace continues, we may be required to record impairment charges.  Moreover, the sustained uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities.  To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs.

We rely on EchoStar to design and develop all of our new set-top boxes and certain related components, and to provide transponder capacity, digital broadcast operations and other services to us.  Our business would be adversely affected if EchoStar ceases to provide these services to us and we are unable to obtain suitable replacement services from third parties.

EchoStar is our sole supplier of digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operations.  In addition, EchoStar is a key supplier of transponder capacity and related services to us.  Our digital set-top box purchases are made and digital broadcast operations are received pursuant to contracts that generally expire on January 1, 2012.  EchoStar has no obligation to supply digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations to us after that date.  We may be unable to renew agreements for digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations with EchoStar on acceptable terms or at all.  Equipment, transponder leasing and digital broadcast operation costs may increase beyond our current expectations.  EchoStar’s inability to develop and produce, or our inability to obtain, equipment with the latest technology, or our inability to obtain transponder capacity and digital broa
dcast operations and other services from third parties, could affect our subscriber acquisition and churn and cause related revenue to decline.

Furthermore, due to the lack of compatibility of our infrastructure with the set-top boxes of a provider other than EchoStar, any transition to a new supplier of set-top boxes could take a significant period of time to complete, cause us to incur significant costs and negatively affect our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn.  For example, the proprietary nature of the Sling technology and certain other technology used in EchoStar’s set-top boxes may significantly limit our ability to obtain set-top boxes with the same or similar features from any other provider of set-top boxes.

If we were to switch to another provider of set-top boxes, we may have to implement additional infrastructure to support the set-top boxes purchased from such new provider, which could significantly increase our costs.  In



addition, differences in, among other things, the user interface between set-top boxes provided by EchoStar and those of any other provider could cause subscriber confusion, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn.  Furthermore, switching to a new provider of set-top boxes may cause a reduction in our supply of set-top boxes and thus delay our ability to ship set-top boxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate.

We rely on one or a limited number of vendors, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We have contracted with a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices.  Our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately.  In addition, we have historically relied on a single source for certain items.  If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they are no longer in business, they are experiencing shortages or they discontinue a certain product or service we need, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.  Our inability to develop alternative sources quickly and on a cost-effective basis could materially impair our ability to timely deliver our products to our subscribers or operate our business.  Furthermore, our vendors may request changes in 
pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.

Our programming signals are subject to theft, and we are vulnerable to other forms of fraud that could require us to make significant expenditures to remedy.

Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors’ signals could, in addition to reducing new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase.  We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized cards, called “smart cards,” or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (“Security Access Devices”).

Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult.  It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft.  During 2009, we completed the replacement of our Security Access Devices and re-secured our system.  We expect additional future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure.  We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system’s security is compromised.

We are also vulnerable to other forms of fraud.  While we are addressing certain fraud through a number of actions, including terminating retailers that we believe were in violation of DISH Network’s business rules, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our subscriber growth and churn.  Sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and other forms of fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.

We depend on third parties to solicit orders for DISH Network services that represent a significant percentage of our total gross subscriber acquisitions.

Most of our retailers are not exclusive to us and may favor our competitors’ products and services over ours based on the relative financial arrangements associated with selling our products and those of our competitors.  Furthermore, most of these retailers are significantly smaller than we are and may be more susceptible to sustained economic weaknesses that make it more difficult for them to operate profitably.  Because our retailers receive most of their incentive value at activation and not over an extended period of time, our interests in obtaining and retaining subscribers through good customer service may not always be aligned with our retailers.  It may be difficult to better align our interests with our resellers’ because of their capital and liquidity constraints.  Loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our subscriber base and certain of our other ke
y operating metrics because we may not be able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels.



Our competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers so that they are able to reduce their programming costs and offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us.

The cost of programming represents the largest percentage of our overall costs.  Certain of our competitors own directly or are affiliated with companies that own programming content that may enable them to obtain lower programming costs or offer exclusive programming that may be attractive to prospective subscribers.  Unlike our larger cable and satellite competitors, we have not made significant investments in programming providers.  For example, Comcast and General Electric have joined their programming properties, including NBC, Bravo and many others that are available in the majority of our programming packages, in a venture to be controlled by Comcast.  This transaction may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to their programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all.  The transaction was approved by the FC
C and the Department of Justice in January 2011.  The FCC conditioned its approval on, among other things, Comcast complying with the terms of the FCC’s recent order on network neutrality (even if that order is vacated by judicial or legislative action) and Comcast licensing its affiliated content to us, other traditional pay-TV providers and certain providers of video services over the Internet on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, including, among others, price.  If Comcast does not license its affiliated content to us on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, we can seek arbitration and continue to carry such content while the arbitration is pending.  However, it is uncertain how these conditions may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these conditions.

We depend on the Cable Act for access to programming from cable-affiliate programmers at cost-effective rates.

We purchase a large percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers.  The provisions of the Cable Act prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable-affiliated programmers were extended for another five-year period in September 2007.  Cable companies appealed the FCC’s decision, and while that decision was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in March 2010, that court indicated if the market continues to evolve, it is expected that the exclusivity prohibition may no longer be necessary.  Any change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming could adversely affect our ability to acquire cable-affiliated programming at all or to acquire programming on a cost-effective basis.  As a result, we may be limited in our 
ability to obtain access on nondiscriminatory terms to programming from programmers that are affiliated with cable system operators.  In the case of certain types of programming affiliated with Comcast, Time-Warner Cable, and Liberty, the terms of access to the programming are subject to arbitration if we and the programmer cannot reach agreement on terms, subject to FCC review.  We cannot be sure that this procedure will result in favorable terms for us or that the FCC conditions that establish this procedure will be allowed to expire on their own terms.

In addition, affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite.  The FCC recently held that new denials of such service are unfair if they have the purpose or effect of significantly hindering us from providing programming to consumers.  However, we cannot be sure that we can prevail in a complaint related to such programming, and gain access to it.  Our continuing failure to access such programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these cable providers.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming that may limit our ability to maintain our

foreign language programming subscriber

base

.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming, including programming distributed over the Internet.  There can be no assurance that we will maintain subscribers in our foreign language programming services.  In addition, the increasing availability of foreign language programming from our competitors, which in certain cases has resulted from our inability to renew programming agreements on an exclusive basis or at all, could contribute to an increase in our subscriber churn.  Our agreements with distributors of foreign language programming have varying expiration dates, and some agreements are on a month-to-month basis.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain our foreign language programming subscriber base.



Our local programming strategy faces uncertainty because we may not be able to obtain necessary retransmission consents

at acceptable rates from local network stations.

The Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network station that do not elect “must carry” status, as required by the Communications Act.  If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals.  This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals.  While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, there remain stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement.  We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms (or at all) up
on the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term.  In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations.  These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming.  Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing.  We may be unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The injunction against our retransmission of distant networks, currently waived, may be reinstated.

Pursuant to STELA, we have been able to obtain a waiver of a court injunction that previously prevented us from retransmitting certain distant network signals under a statutory copyright license.  Because of that waiver, we may once again provide distant network signals to eligible subscribers.  To qualify for that waiver, we are required to provide local service in all 210 local markets in the U.S. on an ongoing basis.  This condition poses a significant strain on our capacity.  Moreover, we may lose that waiver if we are found to have failed to provide local service in any of the 210 local markets.  If we lose the waiver, the injunction could be reinstated.  Furthermore, depending on the severity of the failure, we may also be subject to other sanctions, which may include, among other things, damages.  Our compliance with certain conditions for the waiver is subject to exami
nation and review.

We are subject to significant regulatory oversight and changes in applicable regu

l

atory requirements,

including any adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet,

which could adversely affect our business.

DBS operators are subject to significant government regulation, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and foreign, state and local authorities.  Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these entities could result in the suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore, the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.  If we become subject to new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of e
xisting regulations or legislation that govern Internet network neutrality, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.  The manner in which legislation governing Internet network neutrality may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  You should review the regulatory disclosures under the caption “

Item 1.  Business — Government Regulation — FCC Regulation under the Communication Act”

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have made a substantial investment in certain 700 MHz wireless licenses and will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others to commercialize these licenses.

In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009.  To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others.  Depending on the nature and scope of such



commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly.  Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements.  We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these investments and profitably deploy the spectrum represented by the 700 MHz licenses.

Furthermore, the fair values of wireless licenses may vary significantly in the future.  In particular, valuation swings could occur if:

·

consolidation in the wireless industry allows or requires wireless carriers to sell significant portions of their wireless spectrum holdings, which could in turn reduce the value of our spectrum holdings; or

·

a sudden large sale of spectrum by one or more wireless providers occurs.

In addition, the fair value of wireless licenses could decline as a result of the FCC’s pursuit of policies, including auctions, designed to increase the number of wireless licenses available in each of our markets.  If the fair value of our 700 MHz licenses were to decline significantly, the value of our 700 MHz licenses could be subject to non-cash impairment charges.  We assess potential impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including our 700 MHz licenses annually to determine whether there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.

We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt.

As of December 31, 2010, our total debt, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was $6.515 billion.  Our debt levels could have significant consequences, including:

·

requiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes.  As a result, we would have limited  financial and operating flexibility in responding to changing economic and competitive conditions;

·

limiting our ability to raise additional debt because it may be more difficult for us to obtain debt financing on attractive terms; and

·

placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future.  The terms of the indentures relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks we now face could intensify.

We have limited owned and leased satellite capacity and failures or reduced capacity could adversely affect our business.

Operation of our programming service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer.  Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming, particularly by expanding local HD coverage and offering more HD national channels.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.

Our ability to earn revenue depends on the usefulness of our satellites, each of which has a limited useful life.  A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite’s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion.  Generally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites ranges from 12 to 15 years.  We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of the satellites.  Our operating results could be adversely affected if the useful life of any of our satellites were significantly shorter than 12 years from the launch date.



In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive.  A relocation would require FCC approval and, among other things, a showing to the FCC that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite.  We cannot be certain that we could obtain such FCC approval.  If we choose to use a satellite in this manner, this use could adversely affect our ability to meet the operation deadlines associated w
ith our authorizations.  Failure to meet those deadlines could result in the loss of such authorizations, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.

Our owned and leased satellites are subject to construction, launch, operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.

Construction and launch risks.

A key component of our business strategy is our ability to expand our offering of new programming and services, including increased local and HD programming.  To accomplish this goal, we need to construct and launch satellites.  Satellite construction and launch is subject to significant risks, including construction and launch delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement.  Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the recent past.  The risks of launch delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of previous successful flights.  Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the nee
d both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than three years, and to obtain other launch opportunities.  Significant construction or launch delays could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.  If we were unable to obtain launch insurance, or obtain launch insurance at rates we deem commercially reasonable, and a significant launch failure were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.

In addition, the occurrence of future launch failures may delay the deployment of our satellites and materially and adversely affect our ability to insure the launch of our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all.  Please see further discussion under the caption “

We generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use and could face significant impairment charges if one of our satellites fails

” below.

Operational risks

.

Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit.  These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturers’ errors, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.

Although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the satellites, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components.

Any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations and revenues and our relationship with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new customers for our multi-channel video services.  In particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly.  Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the channels that could be offered using that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or back-up satellites.  You should review the disclosures relating to satellite anomalies set forth under Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental risks.

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.  The probability that meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth passes through the particulate stream left behind by comets.  Occasionally, increased solar activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.



Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass through the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to operational spacecraft, including our satellites.  We may be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers.  The loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use and could face significant impairment charges if one of our satellites fails.

Generally, we do not carry launch or in-orbit insurance on the satellites we use.  We currently do not carry in-orbit insurance on any of our satellites and generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures.  If one or more of our in-orbit satellites fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges.

We may have potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar due to our common ownership and management.

Questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between EchoStar and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between EchoStar and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

Cross officerships, directorships and stock ownership

.

We have significant overlap in directors and executive officers with EchoStar, which may lead to conflicting interests.  Two of our officers provide management services to EchoStar pursuant to a management services agreement between EchoStar and us and two executive officers are employees of both us and EchoStar.  These individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company.  Furthermore, our Board of Directors and executive officers inc
lude persons who are members of the Board of Directors of EchoStar, including Charles W. Ergen, who serves as the Chairman of EchoStar and us.  The executive officers and the members of our Board of Directors who overlap with EchoStar have fiduciary duties to EchoStar’s shareholders.  For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we or EchoStar look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies.  In addition, certain of our directors and officers own EchoStar stock and options to purchase EchoStar stock, which they acquired or were granted prior to the Spin-off of EchoStar from us, including Mr. Ergen, who owns approximately 43.8% of the total equity (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock) and controls approximately 56.0% of the voting power of EchoStar.  Mr. Ergen’s beneficial ownership of EchoStar excludes 18,900,405 shares of it
s Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of its Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.  These trusts beneficially own approximately 33.5% of EchoStar’s total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock) and possess approximately 36.7% of EchoStar’s total voting power. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and EchoStar.

·

Intercompany agreements related to the Spin-off.

We have entered into certain agreements with EchoStar pursuant to which we provide EchoStar with certain management, administrative, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which EchoStar pays us our cost plus a fixed margin.  In addition, we have entered into a number of intercompany agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and EchoStar’s responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by us for certain of EchoStar’s businesses.  We have also entered into certain commercial agreements with Ech
oStar pursuant to which EchoStar, among other things, sells set-top boxes and related equipment to us at specified prices.  The terms of certain of these agreements were established while EchoStar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and were not the result of arm’s length negotiations.  The allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between EchoStar and us under the separation and other intercompany agreements we entered into with EchoStar in connection with the Spin-off of EchoStar may have been different if agreed to by two unaffiliated parties.  Had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties, their terms may have been more favorable, or less favorable, to us.  In addition, conflicts could arise between us and EchoStar in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of these existing agreements.



·

Additional intercompany transactions.

EchoStar or its affiliates have and will continue to enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries or other affiliates.  Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between EchoStar and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of a committee of the non-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained between 
unaffiliated parties.

·

Business opportunities.

We have retained interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by EchoStar.  We may also compete with EchoStar when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites.  In addition, EchoStar may in the future use its satellites, uplink and transmission assets to compete directly against us in the subscription television business.

We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.

We also do not have any agreements with EchoStar that would prevent either company from competing with the other.

We rely on key personnel

and the loss of their services may negatively affect our businesses.

We believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and certain other executives.  The loss of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Although all of our executives have executed agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors if they leave us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them.  Pursuant to a management services agreement with EchoStar entered into at the time of the Spin-off, two of our officers provide services to EchoStar.  In addition, Roger J. Lynch also serves as Executive Vice President, Advanced Technologies of EchoStar.  To the extent Mr. Lynch and such other officers are performing services for EchoStar,
 this may divert their time and attention away from our business and may therefore adversely affect our business.

We are party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, including among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees.  Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer.  In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes on intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the intellectual property.  If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any pr
ice, which could adversely affect our competitive position.  Please see further discussion under

Item 1. Business — Patents and Trademarks

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our services or the products used in connection with our services may potentially infringe.  In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office issues a patent.  Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which our services or the products used in connection with our services may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications.  Further, it is often not possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid.

We may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.

Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may



not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:

·

the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;

·

possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;

·

a high degree of risk involved in these transactions, which could become substantial over time, and higher exposure to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful; and

·

our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction.

In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies.

New acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses or be distributed to shareholders. Commitment of this capital may cause us to defer or suspend any share repurchases that we otherwise may have made.

Our business depends on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted.

If the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend, restrict, significantly condition, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to grant our applications for FCC licenses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to us, potentially reducing the amount of services available to our subscribers.  The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum.  In addition, Congress often considers and enacts legislation that affects us and FCC proceedings to implement the Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing.  We cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their e
ffect on our business.

We are subject to digital HD “carry-one, carry-all” requirements that cause capacity constraints.

To provide any full-power local broadcast signal in any market, we are required to retransmit all qualifying broadcast signals in that market (“carry-one, carry-all”).  The FCC has adopted digital carriage rules that require DBS providers to phase in carry-one, carry-all obligations with respect to the carriage of full-power broadcasters’ HD signals by February 2013 in markets in which DISH Network elects to provide local channels in HD.  In addition, STELA has imposed accelerated HD carriage requirements for noncommercial educational stations on DBS providers that do not have a certain contractual relationship with a certain number of such stations.  DISH Network has entered into an agreement with a number of PBS stations to comply with the requirements.  DISH Network has also challenged the constitutionality of this provision but has not prevailed in its effort to 
obtain temporary injunctive relief.  The carriage of additional HD signals on our DBS system could cause us to experience significant capacity constraints and prevent us from carrying additional popular national programs and/or carrying those national programs in HD.

In addition, there is a pending rulemaking before the FCC regarding whether to require DBS providers to carry all broadcast stations in a local market in both standard definition and HD if they carry any station in that market in both standard definition and HD.  If we were required to carry multiple versions of each broadcast station, we would have to dedicate more of our finite satellite capacity to each broadcast station.  We cannot predict the outcome or timing of that rulemaking process.



It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our ownership structure.

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable.  These provisions include the following:

·

a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock:  a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share, a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share;

·

a provision that authorizes the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;

·

a provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and

·

a provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.

In addition, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.

We are controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, currently beneficially owns approximately 53.6% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock) and possesses approximately 90.5% of the total voting power.  Mr. Ergen’s beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock excludes 4,245,151 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.  These trusts beneficially own approximately 2.0% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock) and possess approximately 1.6% of the total voting power.  Through his voting power, Mr. Er
gen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders.  As a result, DISH Network is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.

There can be no assurance that there will not be deficiencies leading to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

We periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.  If in the future we are unable to report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree with our assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal control over financial reporting), investors, customers and business partners could lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.

We may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.

Item 2.

PROPERTIES

The following table sets forth certain information concerning our principal properties, all of which are used by DISH Network, our only business segment.

(1)

See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our Related Party Agreements.

In addition to the principal properties listed above, we operate several DISH Network service centers strategically located in regions throughout the United States.  Furthermore, we own or lease capacity on 13 satellites which are a major component of our DISH Network DBS System.  See further discussion under “Item 1. Business — Satellites” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a separation agreement with EchoStar, which provides, among other things, for the division of certain liabilities, including liabilities resulting from litigation.  Under the terms of the separation agreement, EchoStar has assumed certain liabilities that relate to its business including certain designated liabilities for acts or omissions prior to the Spin-off.  Certain specific provisions govern intellectual property related claims under which, generally, EchoStar will only be liable for its acts or omissions following the Spin-off and we will indemnify EchoStar for any liabilities or damages resulting from intellectual property claims relating to the period prior to the Spin-off as well as our acts or omissions following the Spin-off.

Acacia

During 2004, Acacia Media Technologies (“Acacia”) filed a lawsuit against us and EchoStar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast, Charter, Cox and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants.  Acacia is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.  The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992; 5,253,275; 5,550,863; 6,002,720; and 6,144,702, which relate to certain systems and methods for transmission of digital data.  On September 25, 2009, the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on invalidity grounds, and dismissed the action with prejudice.  On October 8, 2010, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.  Acacia may no longer appeal this dism
issal since their time to seek en banc review with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals or petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari has now expired.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

During 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. (“Broadcast Innovation”) filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV, Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in United States District Court in Denver, Colorado.  Broadcast Innovation is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.  The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the ‘066 patent).  The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data.  The ‘066 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on removable cards.  Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving us as the only defendant.

During 2004, the District Court issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid.  Also in 2004, the District Court found the ‘094 patent invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter and Comcast.  In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned that finding of invalidity with respect to the ‘094 patent and remanded the Charter case back to the District Court.  During June 2006, Charter filed a reexamination request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  The District Court has stayed the Charter case pending reexamination, and our case has been stayed pending resolution of the Charter case.

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Channel Bundling Class Action

During 2007, a purported class of cable and satellite subscribers filed an antitrust action against us in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The suit also names as defendants DirecTV, Comcast, Cablevision, Cox, Charter, Time Warner, Inc., Time Warner Cable, NBC Universal, Viacom, Fox Entertainment Group and Walt Disney Company.  The suit alleges, among other things, that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to provide customers with access only to bundled channel offerings as opposed to giving customers the ability to purchase channels on an “a la carte” basis.  On October 16, 2009, the District Court granted defendants’



motion to dismiss with prejudice.  The plaintiffs have appealed.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

ESPN

During 2008, we filed a lawsuit against ESPN, Inc., ESPN Classic, Inc., ABC Cable Networks Group, Soapnet L.L.C. and International Family Entertainment (collectively, “ESPN”) for breach of contract in New York State Supreme Court.  Our complaint alleges that ESPN failed to provide us with certain high-definition feeds of the Disney Channel, ESPN News, Toon and ABC Family.  ESPN asserted a counterclaim, and then filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that we owed approximately $35 million under the applicable affiliation agreements.  We brought a motion to amend our complaint to assert that ESPN was in breach of certain most-favored-nation provisions under the applicable affiliation agreements.  On April 15, 2009, the New York State Supreme Court granted our motion to amend the complaint, and granted, in part, ESPN’s motion on the counterclaim, finding tha
t we are liable for some of the amount alleged to be owing but that the actual amount owing is disputed.  We appealed the partial grant of ESPN’s motion to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  After the partial grant of ESPN’s motion, ESPN sought an additional $30 million under the applicable affiliation agreements.  On March 15, 2010, the New York State Supreme Court affirmed the prior grant of ESPN’s motion and ruled that we owe the full amount of approximately $65 million under the applicable affiliation agreement.  There can be no assurance that ESPN will not seek, and that the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department will not award a higher amount.  On December 29, 2010, the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed the partial grant of ESPN’s motion on the counterclaim.  However, it did not rule on the amount that we owe ESPN pursuant to its co
unterclaim.  The appellate court will determine this amount as part of a separate proceeding.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $42 million as a “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), which reflects our estimated exposure for ESPN’s counterclaim. We intend to vigorously prosecute and defend this case.

Finisar Corporation

Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) obtained a $100 million verdict in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against DirecTV for patent infringement.  Finisar, an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein, alleged that DirecTV’s electronic program guide and other elements of its system infringe United States Patent No. 5,404,505 (the ‘505 patent).

During 2006, we and EchoStar, together with NagraStar L.L.C., filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Finisar that asks the Court to declare that we do not infringe, and have not infringed, any valid claim of the ‘505 patent.  Finisar brought counterclaims against us, EchoStar and NagraStar alleging that we infringed the ‘505 patent.  During April 2008, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment against DirecTV and ordered a new trial.  On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of DirecTV and during January 2010, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment, and dismissed the action with prejudice.  Finisar then agreed to dismiss its counterclaims against us, EchoStar and NagraStar without prejudice.  We also agreed to dismiss our Decla
ratory Judgment action without prejudice.

Ganas L.L.C.

During August 2010, Ganas, L.L.C. (“Ganas”) filed suit against DISH DBS Corporation, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Sabre Holdings Corporation, SAP America, Inc., SAS Institute Inc., Scottrade, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., The Charles Schwab Corporation, Tivo Inc., Unicoi Systems Inc., Xerox Corporation, Adobe Systems Inc., AOL Inc., Apple Inc., Axibase Corporation, DirecTV, E*Trade Securities L.L.C., Exinda Networks, Fidelity Brokerage Services L.L.C., Firstrade Securities Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, iControl Inc., International Business Machines Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos.  7,136,913, 7,325,053, and 7,734,756.  The patents relate to hypertext transfer protocol and simple object access protocol.  Ganas is an entity t

Personalized Media Communications

During 2008, Personalized Media Communications, Inc. (“PMC”) filed suit against us, EchoStar and Motorola, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 4,694,490; 5,109,414; 4,965,825; 5,233,654; 5,335,277; and 5,887,243, which relate to satellite signal processing.  PMC is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction



that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Retailer Class Actions

During 2000, lawsuits were filed by retailers in Colorado state and federal courts attempting to certify nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our retailers.  The plaintiffs requested that the Courts declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged agreements between us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and payments, charge backs and other compensation.  On September 20, 2010, we agreed to a settlement of both lawsuits that provides, among other things, for mutual releases of the claims underlying the litigation, payment by us of up to $60 million, and the option for certain class members to elect to reinstate certain monthly incentive payments, which the parties agreed have an aggregate maximum value of $23 million. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many class members will elect to reinstate these monthly incent
ive payments. As a result, we recorded $60 million as a “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in “Litigation expense” for the year ended December 31, 2010 on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  On February 9, 2011, the court granted final approval of the settlement; however, our payment of the settlement amount is still subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the lapse of all applicable appeal periods.

Suomen Colorize Oy

During October 2010, Suomen Colorize Oy (“Suomen”) filed suit against DISH Network L.L.C., our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and EchoStar in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 7,277,398. Suomen is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein. The abstract of the patent states that the claims are directed to a method and terminal for providing services in a telecommunication network.

We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Technology Development Licensing

On January 22, 2009, Technology Development and Licensing L.L.C. (“TDL”) filed suit against us and EchoStar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement of United States Patent No. Re. 35,952, which relates to certain favorite channel features. TDL is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein. In July 2009, the Court granted our motion to stay the case pending two re-examination petitions before the Patent and Trademark Office.

We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Tivo Inc.

During January 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the April 2006 jury verdict concluding that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs, infringed a patent held by Tivo. As of September 2008, we had recorded a total accrual of $132 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the April 2006 jury verdict, supplemental damages through September 2006 and pre-judgment interest awarded by the Texas court, together with the estimated cost of potential further software infringement prior to implementation of our alternative technology, discussed below, plus interest subsequent to entry of the judgment. In its January 2008 decision, the Federal Circuit affirmed the jury’s verdict of infringement on Tivo’s “software



claims,” and upheld the award of damages from the District Court. The Federal Circuit, however, found that we did not literally infringe Tivo’s “hardware claims,” and remanded such claims back to the District Court for further proceedings. On October 6, 2008, the Supreme Court denied our petition for certiorari. As a result, approximately $105 million of the total $132 million accrual was released from an escrow account to Tivo.

We also developed and deployed “next-generation” DVR software. This improved software was automatically downloaded to our current customers’ DVRs, and is fully operational (our “original alternative technology”). The download was completed as of April 2007. We received written legal opinions from outside counsel that concluded our original alternative technology does not infringe, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, either the hardware or software claims of Tivo’s patent. Tivo filed a motion for contempt alleging that we are in violation of the Court’s injunction. We opposed this motion on the grounds that the injunction did not apply to DVRs that have received our original alternative technology, that our original alternative technology does not infringe Tivo’s patent, and that we were in compliance with the injunction.

In June 2009, the United States District Court granted Tivo’s motion for contempt, finding that our original alternative technology was not more than colorably different than the products found by the jury to infringe Tivo’s patent, that our original alternative technology still infringed the software claims, and that even if our original alternative technology was “non-infringing,” the original injunction by its terms required that we disable DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field. The District Court also amended its original injunction to require that we inform the court of any further attempts to design around Tivo’s patent and seek approval from the court before any such design-around is implemented. The District Court awarded Tivo $103 million in supplemental damages and interest for the period from September 2006 through Apr
il 2008, based on an assumed $1.25 per subscriber per month royalty rate. We posted a bond to secure that award pending appeal of the contempt order. On July 1, 2009, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted a permanent stay of the District Court’s contempt order pending resolution of our appeal.

The District Court held a hearing on July 28, 2009 on Tivo’s claims for contempt sanctions. Tivo sought up to $975 million in contempt sanctions for the period from April 2008 to June 2009 based on, among other things, profits Tivo alleges we made from subscribers using DVRs. We opposed Tivo’s request arguing, among other things, that sanctions are inappropriate because we made good faith efforts to comply with the Court’s injunction. We also challenged Tivo’s calculation of profits. On September 4, 2009, the District Court partially granted Tivo’s motion for contempt sanctions and awarded $2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the period from April 2008 to July 2009 (as compared to the award for supplemental damages for the prior period from September 2006 to April 2008, which was based on an assumed $1.25 per DVR subscriber per month). By the Di
strict Court’s estimation, the total award for the period from April 2008 to July 2009 is approximately $200 million. The District Court also awarded Tivo its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred during the contempt proceedings. Enforcement of these awards has been stayed by the District Court pending resolution of our appeal of the underlying June 2009 contempt order. On February 8, 2010, we and Tivo submitted a stipulation to the District Court that the attorneys’ fees and costs, including expert witness fees and costs, that Tivo incurred during the contempt proceedings amounted to $6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we increased our total accrual by $361 million to reflect the supplemental damages and interest for the period from implementation of our original alternative technology through April 2008 and for the estimated cost of alleged software infringement (including contempt sanctions for the period from April 2008 through June 200
9) for the period from April 2008 through December 2009 plus interest. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $124 million and $361 million, respectively, of “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not record any litigation expense related to this case. Our total accrual at December 31, 2010 was $517 million and is included in “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In light of the District Court’s finding of contempt, and its description of the manner in which it believes our original alternative technology infringed the ‘389 patent, we are also developing and testing potential new alternative technology in an engineering environment. As part of EchoStar’s development process, EchoStar downloaded several of our design-around options to less than 1,000 subscribers for “beta” testing. On March 11, 2010, we requested that the District Court approve the implementation of one of our design-around options on an expedited basis. There can be no assurance that the District Court will approve this request.



Oral argument on our appeal of the contempt ruling took place on November 2, 2009, before a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 4, 2010, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s contempt order in a 2-1 decision. On May 14, 2010, our petition for en banc review of that decision by the full Federal Circuit was granted and the opinion of the three-judge panel was vacated. Oral argument occurred on November 9, 2010. There can be no assurance that the full Federal Circuit will reverse the decision of the three-judge panel. Tivo has stated that it will seek additional damages for the period from June 2009 to the present. Although we have accrued our best estimate of damages, contempt sanctions and interest through December 31, 2010, there can be no assurance that Tivo will not seek, and that the court will not award, an amount that exceeds ou
r accrual.

On October 6, 2010, the Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”) issued an office action confirming the validity of certain of the software claims of United States Patent No. 6,233,389 (the ‘389 patent). However, the PTO only confirmed the validity of the ‘389 patent after Tivo made statements that we believe narrow the scope of its claims. The claims that were confirmed thus should not have the same scope as the claims that we were found to have infringed and which underlie the contempt ruling that we are now appealing. Therefore, we believe that the PTO’s conclusions are relevant to the issues on appeal. The PTO’s conclusions support our position that our original alternative technology does not infringe and that we acted in good faith to design around Tivo’s patent.

If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers. Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services. The adverse effect on 
our financial position and results of operations if the District Court’s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant. Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further award of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009. In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest. Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital. Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives. We believe the cost of such capital and its
 terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings.

If we are successful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo’s patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material. We could also have to pay substantial additional damages.

Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court. We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit. EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar’s $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar’s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any potential new alternative te
chnology.



Voom

In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings (“Voom”) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service. At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement.    The Court denied Voom’s request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment.  Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions.  On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom’s motions for discovery sanctions.  The Court’s decision provid
es for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial.  We appealed the grant of Voom’s motion for discovery sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Other

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, including, among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

DISH Network added approximately 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009. This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009. Churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry, the current economic conditions, multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of 2010, and our 2010 price increases. In general, our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters, our ability to provide strong customer service, and our ability to control piracy. Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the 
months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers. In February 2008, we extended our new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months. Consequently, during the second half of 2009, churn was positively impacted by, among other things, this increase in our new subscriber commitment period.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, DISH Network added approximately 3.052 million gross new subscribers compared to approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers during the same period in 2009, a decrease of 2.1%. Our gross activations in 2010 were negatively impacted relative to 2009 by increased competitive pressures, including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors’ promotional offers, which included an increased level of discounts.

Programming costs continue to represent an increasing percentage of our “Subscriber-related expenses.” Going forward, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Additionally, our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts before they expire. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our gross subscriber activations and subscriber churn were negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers.

As the pay-TV industry matures, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. Some of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers. Furthermore, although we seek to remain the low cost provider in the pay-TV industry in the U.S., our price increases during 2010 along with our inability to effectively market our low cost position contributed to increased churn. In addition, programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could mate
rially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.

While economic factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to DISH Network. In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by operational inefficiencies at DISH Network.

To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we completed the replacement of our security access devices to re-secure our system during 2009. We expect that additional future replacements of these



devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. To combat other forms of fraud, we continue to monitor our third party distributors to ensure adherence to our business rules.

While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial position and results of operations. To address our operational inefficiencies, we continue to focus on simplifying and standardizing our operations. For example, we have streamlined our hardware offerings and continue to make significant investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot, however, be certain that our increased spending will ultimately be successful in yielding such returns.

We have been investing more in advanced technology equipment as part of our subscriber acquisition and retention efforts. Initiatives to transmit certain programming only in MPEG-4 and to activate most new subscribers only with MPEG-4 receivers have accelerated our deployment of MPEG-4 receivers. To meet current demand, we have increased the rate at which we upgrade existing subscribers to HD and DVR receivers. While these efforts may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs, we believe that they will help mitigate subscriber churn in the future and reduce costs over the long run.

We are also continuing to change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives. We expect to continue these initiatives through 2011. We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes.

To maintain and enhance our competitiveness over the long term, we are promoting a suite of integrated products designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere, referred to as “TV Everywhere.” TV Everywhere utilizes, among other things, online access and Slingbox “placeshifting” technology. There can be no assurance that these integrated products will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new subscriber additions.

Liquidity Drivers

Like many companies, we make general investments in property such as satellites, information technology and facilities that support our overall business. As a subscriber-based company, however, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive.

There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. As we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins. To the extent our “Subscriber-related expenses” grow faster than our “Subscriber-related revenue,” the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with new subscribers. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we mak
e general investments and any cash flow from financing activities.

Our subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow. While fewer subscribers might translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long-term, cash flow is actually aided, in the short-term, by the reduction in subscriber-specific investment spending. As a result, a slow down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short-term liquidity risk as it might in other industries.



Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity

The ability to raise capital has generally existed for DISH Network despite the weak economic conditions.  Because of the cash flow of our company and the absence of any material debt payments until October 2011, modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not impact our current operational plans.  Currently, we have no existing lines of credit, nor have we historically.

Future Liquidity

Our “Subscriber-related expenses” as a percentage of “Subscriber-related revenue” was 53.2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 55.1% during the same period in 2009.  ARPU was positively impacted by price increases in February and June 2010.  “Subscriber-related expenses” continued to be negatively impacted by increased programming costs and initiatives to improve customer service.  We continue to focus on addressing operational inefficiencies specific to DISH Network, which we believe will contribute to long-term subscriber growth.

If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers.  Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services.  The 
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court’s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant.  Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further award of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009.  In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest.  Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital.  Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives.&#
160; We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings.

If we are successful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo’s patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material.  We could also have to pay substantial additional damages.

Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court.  We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit.  EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar’s $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar’s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote
ntial new alternative technology.

If Voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.  In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings (“Voom”) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other



claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service.  At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement.  The Court denied Voom’s request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment.  Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions.  On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom’s motions for discovery sanctions.  The Court’s decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial.  We appealed the grant of Voom’s motion for disc
overy sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal.  Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages.

We entered into an $87.5 million Credit Facility with DBSD North America on February 1, 2011.  The Credit Facility remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.  In addition, on February 1, 2011 we committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America’s existing debt.  This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America’s emergence from bankruptcy.  See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

The Spin-off.

On January 1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the “Spin-off”) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar.  DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies, and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other.  However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both companies is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer or by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.

EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS

Subscriber-related revenue

.

“Subscriber-related revenue” consists principally of revenue from basic, premium movie, local, HD programming, pay-per-view, Latino and international subscription television services, equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers, advertising services, fees earned from our in-home service operations and other subscriber revenue.  Certain of the amounts included in “Subscriber-related revenue” are not recurring on a monthly basis.

Equipment sales and other revenue

.

“Equipment sales and other revenue” principally includes the non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers.

Equipment sales, services and other revenue — EchoStar.

“Equipment sales, services and other revenue — EchoStar” includes revenue related to equipment sales, professional services, and other agreements with EchoStar.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses.

Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar” includes the cost of leasing satellite and transponder capacity from EchoStar and the cost of digital broadcast operations provided to us by EchoStar, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, signal processing, conditional access management, telemetry, tracking and control, and other professional services.

Satellite and transmission expenses — other

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses — other” includes executory costs associated with capital leases and costs associated with transponder leases and other related services.

Equipment, services and other cost of sales.

“Equipment, services and other cost of sales” principally includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment



domestically and to DISH Network subscribers.  In addition, this category includes costs related to equipment sales, professional services, and other agreements with EchoStar.

Subscriber acquisition costs

.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of our receiver systems to attract new DISH Network subscribers.  Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” include the cost of our receiver systems sold to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising.  We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new su
bscribers from “Subscriber acquisition costs.”

SAC.

Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the “average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation,” or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  Our SAC is calculated as “Subscriber acquisition costs,” plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross new subscriber additions.  We include all the costs of acquiring subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as our management believes it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers.  
We also include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses” consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including  non-cash, stock-based compensation expense.  It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.

“Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest), and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations.

Other, net.

The main components of “Other, net” are gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable and  non-marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).

EBITDA is defined as “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders” plus “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” net of “Interest income,” “Taxes” and “Depreciation and amortization.”  This “non-GAAP measure” is reconciled to “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders” in our discussion of “Results of Operations” below.

DISH Network subscribers.

We include customers obtained through direct sales, third-party retailers and other third-party distribution relationships in our DISH Network subscriber count.  We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts.  For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our America’s Top 120 programming package (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count.

Average monthly revenue per subscriber (“ARPU”)

.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly “Subscriber-related revenue” for the period (total “Subscriber-related revenue” during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period.  Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and



dividing by the number of months in the period.  Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two.

Average monthly subscriber churn rate.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average DISH Network subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period.  When calculating subscriber churn, the same methodology for calculating average DISH Network subscribers is used as when calculating ARPU.

Free cash flow

.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009.



DISH Network subscribers

.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 14.133 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 14.100 million subscribers at December 31, 2009, an increase of 0.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2010, DISH Network added approximately 3.052 million gross new subscribers compared to approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers during the same period in 2009, a decrease of 2.1%.  Our gross activations in 2010 were negatively impacted relative to 2009 by increased competitive pressures, including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors’ promotional offers, which included an increased level of discounts.  DISH Network added approxima
tely 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009.  This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn.

Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009.  Churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry, the current economic conditions, multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of 2010, and our 2010 price increases.  In general, our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters, our ability to provide strong customer service, and our ability to control piracy.  Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers.  In February 2008, we extended our new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months.  Consequently, during the second half of 2009, churn was positi
vely impacted by, among other things, this increase in our new subscriber commitment period.

When the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth.

We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain third party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service.  Most of these factors have affected both gross new subscriber additions as well as existing subscriber churn.  Our future gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth.

Subscriber-related revenue.

DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $12.544 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.005 billion or 8.7% compared to the same period in 2009.  This change was primarily related to the increase in “ARPU” discussed below as well as a larger average subscriber base during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

ARPU

.  “Average monthly revenue per subscriber” was $73.32 during the year ended December 31, 2010 versus $70.04 during the same period in 2009.  The $3.28 or 4.7% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February and June 2010 and changes in the sales mix toward more advanced hardware offerings.  ARPU increased as a result of higher hardware related fees which include rental fees, fees earned from our in-home service operations, and fees for DVRs.  This increase was partially offset by increases in the amount of promotional discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers.

Equipment sales and other revenue

.

“Equipment sales and other revenue” totaled $60 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $38 million or 38.9% compared to the same period in 2009.  The decrease in “Equipment sales and other revenue” primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non-subsidized DBS receivers and accessories, and digital converter boxes in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

Subscriber-related expenses.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $6.676 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $317 million or 5.0% compared to the same period in 2009.  The increase in “Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to higher programming costs.  The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates and by a larger average subscriber base.  This increase was partially offset by reduced costs related to our call centers, customer retention, and in-home service operations.  We continue to address our operational inefficiencies by streamlining our hardware offerings and making significant investments in staffi
ng, training, information systems and other initiatives, primarily in our call centers and in-home service operations.  “Subscriber-related expenses”



represented 53.2% and 55.1% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The improvement in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from an increase in “Subscriber-related revenue” and the reduced costs discussed above, partially offset by higher programming costs.

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content.  Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base.  In addition, our “Subscriber-related expenses” may face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.

Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar.

“Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar” totaled $418 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $99 million or 30.8% compared to the same period in 2009.  The increase in “Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar” is related to an increase in transponder capacity leased from EchoStar primarily related to the Nimiq 5 satellite, which was placed into service in October 2009, an increase in monthly lease rates per transponder on certain satellites based on the terms of our amended lease agreements and the increase in uplink services.  The increase in uplink services was primarily attributable to the launch of additional local channels and increased costs related to additional 
satellites being placed into service.  See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.  “Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar” as a percentage of “Subscriber-related revenue” increased to 3.3% in 2010 from 2.8% in 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in expenses discussed above.

Equipment, services and other cost of sales.

“Equipment, services and other cost of sales” totaled $76 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $45 million or 37.0% compared to the same period in 2009.  This decrease in “Equipment, services and other cost of sales” primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non-subsidized DBS receivers and accessories and in sales of digital converter boxes, and lower charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled $1.653 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $114 million or 7.4% compared to the same period in 2009.  This increase was primarily attributable to higher SAC discussed below, partially offset by the decline in gross new subscriber additions.

SAC.

SAC was $776 during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $697 during the same period in 2009, an increase of $79 or 11.3%.  This increase was primarily attributable to increased advertising and hardware costs per activation.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $716 million and $634 million, respectively.  This increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from an increase in hardware costs per activation, which was driven by an increase in the deployment of more advanced set-top boxes, such as HD receivers and HD DVRs, and a decrease in the redeployment of remanufactured receivers.  The increase in the deployment of more advanced set-top boxes was partially driven by our HD Free for Life promotion, which began during June 2010.

Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers were partially mitigated by the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers.  However, to remain competitive we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial.  To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.

Our SAC calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program.  During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, these amounts totaled $108 million and $94 million, respectively.

We have been deploying receivers that utilize 8PSK modulation technology and receivers that utilize MPEG-4 compression technology for several years.  These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow more programming



channels to be carried over our existing satellites.  A majority of our customers today, however, do not have receivers that use MPEG-4 compression and a smaller but still significant percentage do not have receivers that use 8PSK modulation.  We may choose to invest significant capital to accelerate the conversion of customers to MPEG-4 and/or 8PSK to realize the bandwidth benefits sooner.  In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs.  All new receivers that we have purchased from EchoStar since 2009 utilize MPEG-4 technology.  Although we continue to refurbish and redeploy MPEG-2 receivers, as a result of our HD initiatives and current promotions, we currently activate most new customers with higher 
priced MPEG-4 technology.  This limits our ability to redeploy MPEG-2 receivers and, to the extent that our promotions are successful, will accelerate the transition to MPEG-4 technology, resulting in an adverse effect on our SAC.

Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” and “SAC” may materially increase in the future to the extent that we transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.  See further discussion under

“Liquidity and Capital Resources — Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs.”

Litigation expense.

“Litigation expense” totaled $225 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a $136 million or 37.6% decrease compared to the same period in 2009.  “Litigation expense” during 2009 included expense related to the Tivo litigation for the period from April 2008 to June 2009 for supplemental damages, contempt sanctions and interest expense.  See Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $984 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a $44 million or 4.7% increase compared to the same period in 2009.  The change in “Depreciation and amortization” expense was primarily due to an increase in depreciation on satellites, as a result of EchoStar XIV and EchoStar XV being placed into service and on equipment leased to subscribers.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.

“Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” totaled $455 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $66 million or 17.1% compared to the same period in 2009.  This change primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt during the second half of 2009.

Other, net.

“Other, net” income totaled $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $47 million compared to the same period in 2009.  This increase primarily resulted from lower impairment charges on marketable and other investment securities of $28 million and higher realized and unrealized gains of marketable and other investment securities in 2010 compared to 2009.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

.

EBITDA was $2.956 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $644 million or 27.9% compared to the same period in 2009. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.



Income tax (provision) benefit, net.

Our income tax provision was $557 million during the year ended

December 31, 2010, an increase of $180 million compared to the same period in 2009.  The increase in the provision was primarily related to the increase in “Income (loss) before income taxes.”

Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders.

“

Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders” was $985 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $349 million compared to $636 million for the same period in 2009.  The increase was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above.



Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008.



DISH Network subscribers.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 14.100 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 13.678 million subscribers at December 31, 2008, an increase of 3.1%.  DISH Network added approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately 2.966 million during the same period in 2008, an increase of 5.1%.

DISH Network added approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a loss of approximately 102,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2008 as a result of higher gross subscriber additions and reduced churn.  Our increased gross subscriber additions were primarily a result of our sales and marketing promotions during the last half of 2009.  Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 1.64%, compared to 1.86% for the same period in 2008.  Churn was positively impacted by, among other things, the completion of our security access device replacement program, an increase in our new subscriber commitment period and initiatives to retain subscribers.  Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers.  In Febr
uary 2008, we extended the required new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months.  During the last half of 2009, due to the change in promotional mix, we had fewer expiring new subscriber commitments.

Subscriber-related revenue.

DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $11.539 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $83 million or 0.7% compared to the same period in 2008.  This change was primarily related to the increase in “ARPU” discussed below, partially offset by the decline in our subscriber base from second quarter 2008 through first quarter 2009.

ARPU

.

“Average monthly revenue per subscriber” was $70.04 during the year ended December 31, 2009 versus $69.27 during the same period in 2008.  The $0.77 or 1.1% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2009 and 2008 on some of our most popular programming packages and changes in the sales mix toward HD programming packages and advanced hardware offerings.  As a result of our promotions, which provided an incentive for advanced hardware offerings, we continued to see increased hardware related fees, which included fees earned from our in-home service operations, rental fees and fees for DVRs.  These increases were partially offset by increases in the amount of promotiona
l discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers and retention initiatives offered to existing subscribers, and by decreases in premium movie revenue and pay-per-view buys.

Equipment sales and other revenue

.

“Equipment sales and other revenue” totaled $98 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $26 million or 21.2% compared to the same period during 2008.  The decrease in “Equipment sales and other revenue” primarily resulted from a decrease in sales of non-subsidized DBS accessories.

Subscriber-related expenses.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $6.359 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $382 million or 6.4% compared to the same period 2008.  The increase in “Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to higher costs for programming content and call center operations.  The increase in programming content costs was primarily related to price increases in certain of our programming contracts and the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates.  The increases related to call center operations were driven in part by our investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives.  “Subscriber-related expenses” represented 55.1% and 52.2% of “Subscriber-related revenue
8; during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar” totaled $320 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $14 million or 4.7% compared to 2008.  The increase in “Satellite and transmission expenses — EchoStar” is primarily related to higher uplink center costs, partially offset by fewer transponders leased during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.  The higher uplink center costs were primarily associated with an increase in the charges from EchoStar related to infrastructure costs for new ground equipment to support our new satellites and the routine replacement of exis
ting uplink equipment.  The decline in transponder lease expense primarily relates to a reduction in the number of transponders leased as a result of the launch of an owned satellite.  This decrease was partially offset by the increase in expense related to the Nimiq 5 satellite, which was placed in service in October 2009.  “Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar” as a percentage of “Subscriber-related revenue” increased to 2.8% in 2009 from 2.7% in 2008.



Equipment, services and other cost of sales.

“Equipment, services and other cost of sales” totaled $121 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $49 million or 28.6% compared to the same period in 2008.  This decrease in “Equipment, services and other cost of sales” primarily resulted from lower non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories, a decline in charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory and a decrease in services provided to EchoStar under our transition services agreement with EchoStar.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled $1.540 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $8 million or 0.5% compared to the same period in 2008.  This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross new subscribers discussed previously, partially offset by lower SAC discussed below.

SAC.

SAC was $697 during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $720 during the same period in 2008, a decrease of $23, or 3.2%.  This decrease was primarily attributable to a change in sales channel mix and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs.  The decrease in hardware cost per activation was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs for new receivers and due to more cost-effective deployment of set-top boxes, requiring less equipment per subscriber.  These decreases in hardware costs were partially offset by an increase in deployment of more advanced set-top boxes, such as HD receivers and HD DVRs.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $634 million and $604 million, respectively.  This increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from the increase in gross new subscribers.

Our SAC calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program.  During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, these amounts totaled $94 million and $128 million, respectively.

General and administrative expenses.

“General and administrative expenses” totaled $603 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $59 million or 10.8% compared to the same period in 2008.  This increase was primarily attributable to additional costs to support the DISH Network television service including personnel costs and professional fees.  “General and administrative expenses” represented 5.2% and 4.7% of “Total revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The increase in the ratio of the expenses to “Total revenue” was primarily attributable to the increase in expenses discussed above.

Litigation expense.

We recorded $361 million of “Litigation expense” during the year ended December 31, 2009 for supplemental damages, contempt sanctions and interest.  See Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $940 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a $60 million or 6.0% decrease compared to the same period in 2008.  The decrease in “Depreciation and amortization” expense was primarily due to the declines in depreciation expense related to set-top boxes used in our lease programs and the abandonment of a software development project during 2008 that was designed to support our IT systems.  The decrease related to set-top boxes was primarily attributable to capitalization of a higher mix of new advanced equipment in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, which has a longer estimated useful life.  In addition, the satellite depreciation expense declined due to the retirements of certa
in satellites from commercial service, almost entirely offset by depreciation expense associated with satellites placed in service in 2008.

Interest income.

“Interest income” totaled $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $21 million or 41.4% compared to the same period in 2008.  This decrease principally resulted from lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities, partially offset by higher average cash and marketable investment securities balances during the year ended December 31, 2009.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.

“Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” totaled $388 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $19 million or 5.0% compared to the same period in 2008.  This change primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt during 2009 and



2008 and the Ciel II capital lease, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with 2008 debt redemptions.

Other, net.

“Other, net” expense totaled $16 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $169 million in 2008, a decrease of $153 million.  This decrease primarily resulted from $178 million less in impairment charges on marketable and other investment securities, partially offset by $33 million less in net gains on the sale and exchanges of investments in 2009 compared to 2008.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

.

EBITDA was $2.311 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $576 million or 20.0% compared to the same period in 2008. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2009 was negatively impacted by the $361 million “Litigation expense.” The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Income tax (provision) benefit, net.

Our income tax provision was $377 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $288 million compared to the same period in 2008.  The decrease in the provision was primarily related to the decrease in “Income (loss) before income taxes” and a decrease in our effective tax rate.  During the year ended December 31, 2008, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the establishment of an $80 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which are capital in nature.

Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders.

“

Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders” was $636 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $267 million compared to $903 million for the same period in 2008.  The decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities

We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents.  See “Item 7A. — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities.  As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $2.940 billion compared to $2.139 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $801 million.  This increase in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities was primarily related to cash generated from operations of $2.140 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.216 billion, including the $103 million assignment from EchoStar of certain rights under a launch contract, and by repurchases of our Class A common stock totaling $107 million.

We have investments in various debt and equity instruments including corporate bonds, corporate equity securities, government bonds, and variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”).  VRDNs are long-term floating rate municipal bonds with embedded put options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest.  All of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source.  Our VRDN portfolio is comprised of investments in many municipalities, which are backed by financial institutions or other highly rated companies that serve as the pledged liquidity source.  While they are classified as marketable investment securities, the put option allows VRDNs to be liquidated generally on a same day or on a five business day settlement basis.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held VRDNs, within our current marketable investment securities portfolio, with fa
ir values of $1.334 billion and $1.054 billion, respectively.

The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities.  Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating income,” “Net income,” “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure “Net cash flow
s from operating activities.”

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in “Purchases of property and equipment” as shown in the “Net cash flows from operating activities” and “Net cash flows from investing” sections, respectively, of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein.  Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management’s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts.  In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary signi
ficantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, and other factors.



The following table reconciles free cash flow to “Net cash flows from operating activities.”

The decrease in free cash flow from 2009 to 2010 of $234 million resulted from a decrease in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of $55 million or 2.5% and an increase in “Purchases of property and equipment” of $179 million or 17.3%.  The decrease in “Net cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to a $605 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $543 million increase in net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash changes in “Deferred tax expense (benefit),” “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments,” and “Depreciation and amortization” expense.  The decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to the increase in inventory and timing differences between book expense and cash paym
ents, primarily related to income taxes and litigation expense.  The increase in “Purchases of property and equipment” in 2010 was primarily attributable to the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract for EchoStar XV and an increase in expenditures for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers.

The increase in free cash flow from 2008 to 2009 of $99 million resulted from an increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of $6 million or 0.3% and a decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” of $93 million or 8.2%.  The increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to an $877 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $871 million decrease in net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash changes in “Depreciation and amortization” expense, “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments,” and “Deferred tax expense (benefit).”  The increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including a $361 million increase in 
the litigation accrual and a $386 million increase in cash flow related to working capital changes and other long-term operating assets.  The decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” in 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in expenditures for satellite construction, and equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers.

Cash flows from operating activities.

We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure.  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.140 billion, $2.195 billion, and $2.188 billion, respectively.  See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in “Free cash flow” above.

Cash flows from investing activities.

Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure.  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.478 billion, $2.606 billion and $1.597 billion, respectively.  During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled $942 million, $876 million and $920 million, respectively.

The decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from 2009 to 2010 of $1.128 billion primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures including the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract from EchoStar.

The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from 2008 to 2009 of $1.008 billion primarily resulted from a net increase in purchases of marketable investment securities, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments and an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments.  The overall net increases were partially offset by



cash used for purchases of FCC licenses during 2008 and a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment during 2009 compared to 2008.

Cash flows from financing activities.

Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, dividends paid on our Class A and Class B common stock and repurchases of our Class A common stock.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $127 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $418 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $1.412 billion.

The net cash inflows in 2009 primarily related to the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by our dividend payment of $894 million.  The net cash outflows in 2010 primarily related to the repurchases of our Class A common stock.

The increase in net cash inflows from 2008 to 2009 primarily resulted from a decrease in the repayment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, an increase in the net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term debt and a decline in stock repurchases.  This increase in net cash inflows was partially offset by the dividend payment of $894 million during 2009.  In addition, the 2008 cash outflows were negatively impacted by the distribution to EchoStar related to the Spin-off.

Other Liquidity Items

Subscriber Churn

DISH Network added approximately 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009.  This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn.  Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009.  See “Results of Operations” above for further discussion.  There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at any given point in time, including subscriber churn and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers.  As we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced.

Satellites

Operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer.  Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming, particularly by expanding local HD coverage and offering more HD national channels.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.  In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.  Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand prog
ramming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity.

Security Systems

Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors’ signals could, in addition to reducing new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase.  We use Security Access Devices in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content.  Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult.  It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft.  During 2009, we completed the replacement of our Security Access Devices and re-secured our system.  We expect additional futu
re replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure.  We cannot ensure that we will be



successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system’s security is compromised.

Stock Repurchases

Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock.  On November 2, 2010, our Board of Directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan, such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of our Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2010, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion under this plan.

The following table provides information regarding repurchases of our Class A common stock.

Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs

We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, retailer incentives, equipment, installation, and new customer promotions.  While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will.  We deploy business rules such as minimum credit requirements and we strive to provide outstanding customer service, to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their DISH Network service over longer periods of time.  Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period.

We incur significant costs to retain our existing customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers.  As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation.  In certain circumstances, we also offer free programming and/or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment to receive service for a minimum term.  A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move.  Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.

Other

We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers.  While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn.  Sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.



Obligations and Future Capital Requirements

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2010, future maturities of our long-term debt, capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows:

The “Satellite-related obligations” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 as filed on March 1, 2010 inadvertently excluded the EchoStar XVI ten-year satellite lease commitment, which was agreed to in December 2009, and is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2012.  The obligations associated with this lease would have increased the previously reported “Satellite-related obligations” during 2012, 2013, 2014, and thereafter by approximately $18 million, $72 million, $72 million and $553 million, respectively.  These amounts are included in the table above.

In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed.  These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

The table above does not include $193 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued, as discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010.  We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months.

The table above does not include the $87.5 million associated with the Credit Facility we entered into with DBSD North America on February 1, 2011.  The Credit Facility remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.  In addition, on February 1, 2011 we committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America’s existing debt.  This amount is also not included in the table above.  This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America’s emergence from bankruptcy.  See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

We have semi-annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long-term debt securities, which are included in the table above.  See Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details.

Other than the “Guarantees” disclosed in Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we generally do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites Under Construction.

As of December 31, 2010, we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from EchoStar that are currently under construction.  Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under “Satellite-related obligations.”



·

QuetzSat-1

.  During 2008, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease capacity on QuetzSat-1, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2011.

·

EchoStar XVI.

During December 2009, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease all of the capacity on EchoStar XVI, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2012.

Satellite Insurance

We generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use.

We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.  In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2011 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment, digital broadcast operations, satellite and transponder leases, engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network.  Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content.  Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management’s control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content.  These programming commitments are not included in the “Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements” table above.  The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases.  Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base.  In addition, our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.

Future Capital Requirements

Our 6 3/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.0 billion mature on October 1, 2011.  We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital.  The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs.  The majority of our capital expenditures for 2011 are driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment, included in our firm purchase obligations, as well as capital expenditures for our satell
ite-related obligations.  These expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain the DISH Network television service.  Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary.  The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives, including our plans to expand our national HD offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time.  Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time, and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or sustained economic weakness.  These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future.

If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license



agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers.  Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services.  The adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court’s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant.  Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further awa
rd of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009.  In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest.  Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital.  Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives.  We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings.

If we are successful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo’s patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material.  We could also have to pay substantial additional damages.

Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court.  We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit.  EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar’s $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar’s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote
ntial new alternative technology.

If Voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.  In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings (“Voom”) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service. At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement.    The Court denied Voom’s request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment.  Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery
 sanctions.  On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom’s motions for discovery sanctions.  The Court’s decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial.  We appealed the grant of Voom’s motion for discovery sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages

In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009.  To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly.  Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements.  We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance.



From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities, improve or sustain our competitive position, or otherwise offer growth opportunities.  We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services.  Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume third party debt or incur other long-term obligations.

On February 1, 2011, we entered into a commitment to provide a debtor-in-possession credit facility to DBSD North America and certain of its affiliates, which will consist of a non-revolving, multiple draw term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $87.5 million.  On February 1, 2011, we entered into an investment agreement pursuant to which we have committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America’s existing debt.  This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America’s emergence from bankruptcy.   See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms.  These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position.

A portion of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities, mortgage backed securities, and strategic investments, and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity.  Liquidity in the markets for these investments has been adversely impacted.  If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace continues, we may be required to record impairment charges.  Moreover, the sustained uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities.  To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates.  The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity.  For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

·

Capitalized satellite receivers

.

Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale.  Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, management’s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence.  Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things,
 historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions.  Changes in estimated useful life may impact “Depreciation and amortization” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  For example, if we decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $106 million.

·

Accounting for investments in private and publicly-traded securities

.

We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices.  We record an investment impairment charge in “Other, net” within “Other Income (Expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other-than-temporary.  We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, mark
et conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment.  Future adverse changes in these factors



could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

·

Fair value of financial instruments

.  Fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument.  Sustained economic weakness has resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments, including Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) and Auction Rate Securities (“ARS”).  For certain of these instruments, there is no or limited observable market data.  Fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current ec
onomic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.  These estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available.  We make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date, credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience.  As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument.  In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique, including liquidity risks, and estimate of future cash flows, could significantly affect these fair value estimates, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.  For example, as of December 31, 2010, we held $169 million of securities that lack obser
vable market quotes, and a 10% decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately $17 million.

·

Valuation of long-lived assets

.

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review.  We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group.  See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its 
carrying value.  In that event, a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled “Impairments of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group.  Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.  Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs.  Among other reasons, changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write-down of the asset in a future period.

·

Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives

.  We evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant.  We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives.  Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.  While our impairment tests in 2010 indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts, significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in
 a write-down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which will be recorded in a new line item entitled “Impairments of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets,” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.  A 10% decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets (while all other assumptions remain unchanged) would not result in these assets being impaired.

·

Income taxes

.  Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities.  We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period.  
Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either “Income tax (provision) benefit, net” on our



Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Stockholders’ equity (deficit)” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations.

·

Uncertainty in tax positions

.  Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position.  Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our “Income tax provision (benefit), net,” which could be material to our consolidated results of operations.

·

Contingent liabilities

.  A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual.  Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes.  Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to “General and administrative expenses” or “Litigation expense
” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue Recognition — Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-13 (“ASU 2009-13”), Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.  ASU 2009-13 changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price.  This standard is effective January 1, 2011.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-13 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Seasonality

Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV service industry.  However, we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future.

Inflation

Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years.  We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures.

Backlog

We do not have any material backlog of our products.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments

Our investments and debt are exposed to market risks, discussed below.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment

Securities

As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of $2.940 billion.  Of that amount, a total of $2.729 billion was invested in:  (a) cash; (b) VRDNs convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less; (c) debt instruments of the United



Item 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK - Continued

States Government and its agencies; (d) commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and/or (e) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above.  The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business.  Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business.  The value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses; however, this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer.

Interest Rate Risk

A change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio.  Based on our December 31, 2010 current non-strategic investment portfolio of $2.729 billion, a hypothetical 10% increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $14 million in fair value of this portfolio.  We normally hold these investments to maturity; however, the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.

Our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2010 of 0.7%.  A change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re-invested at different rates as the instruments mature.  A hypothetical 10% decrease in average interest rates during 2010 would result in a decrease of approximately $2 million in annual interest income.

Strategic Marketable Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2010, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $211 million.  These investments, which are held for strategic and financial purposes, are concentrated in several companies, are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility.  The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors.  These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses.  In general, the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment s
ecurities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business.  A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately $21 million in the fair value of these investments.

Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities and Noncurrent Marketable and Other Investment Securities

Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2010, we had $144 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in:  (a) cash;  (b) VRDNs convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less; (c) debt instruments of the United States Government and its agencies; (d) commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and/or (e) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above.  Based on our December 31, 2010 investment portfolio, a hypothetical 10% increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities.

Noncurrent Auction Rate and Mortgage Backed Securities

As of December 31, 2010, we held investments in auction rate securities (“ARS”) and mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) of $119 million, which are reported at fair value.  Events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ARS and MBS investments.  As a result, we classify these investments as noncurrent



Item 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK - Continued

assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature, and therefore interest rate risk associated with these securities is mitigated.  A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of these investments would result in a decrease of approximately $12 million in the fair value of these investments.

Other Investment Securities

As of

December 31, 2010, we had $105 million of nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes.  We account for these investments under the cost, equity and/or fair value methods of accounting.  A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of these nonpublic debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately $11 million in the fair value of these investments.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies’ businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans.  Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2010, we had long-term debt of $6.515 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately $6.486 billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt, which constitutes approximately 99% of our debt.  The fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates.  A hypothetical 10% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $159 million.  To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt.  As of December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $44 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

From time to time, we speculate using derivative financial instruments, such amounts, however, are typically insignificant.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

DISH Network Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DISH Network Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. We also have audited DISH Network Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). DISH Network Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial repo
rting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on DISH Network Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating th
e design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reaso
nable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DISH Network Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also in our opinion, DISH Network Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.             Organization and Business Activities

Principal Business

DISH Network Corporation is a holding company.  Its subsidiaries (which together with DISH Network Corporation are referred to as “DISH Network,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) operate the DISH Network® direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription television service in the United States which had 14.133 million subscribers as of December 31, 2010.  We have deployed substantial resources to develop the “DISH Network DBS System.”  The DISH Network DBS System consists of our licensed Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) authorized DBS and Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, third-party broadcast operations, customer service facilities, leased fiber network, in-home service and call center operations and certain other assets util
ized in our operations.

Spin-off of Technology and Certain Infrastructure Assets

On January 1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the “Spin-off”) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”).  DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies, and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other.  However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both companies is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer or by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.  The two entities consist of the following:

·

DISH Network Corporation

— which retained its subscription television business, the DISH Network®, and

·

EchoStar Corporation

— which sells equipment, including set-top boxes and related components, to DISH Network and international customers, and provides digital broadcast operations and satellite services to DISH Network and other customers.

Following the Spin-off, we operate in only one reportable segment, the DISH Network segment, which provides a DBS subscription television service in the United States.

2.             Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries, investments in entities in which we have controlling influence and variable interest entities where we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary.  Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the investee.  When we do not have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of an investee, the cost method is used.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense for each reporting period.  Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, allowances for doubtful accounts, self-insurance obligations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, fair value of options granted under our stock-based compensation plans, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, capital leases, asset impairments, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, retailer incentiv
es, programming expenses, subscriber lives and royalty obligations.  Weak economic conditions have increased the inherent uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions indicated above.  Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 may consist of money market funds, government bonds, corporate notes and commercial paper.  The cost of these investments approximates their fair value.

Marketable Investment Securities

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available-for-sale.  We adjust the carrying value of our available-for-sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit),” net of related deferred income tax.  Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are determined to be “other-than-temporary” are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment.

We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other-than-temporary.  This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things:

·

the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount,

·

the historical volatility of the price of each security, and

·

any market and company specific factors related to each security.

F-9


DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis are generally accounted for as follows:

In situations where the fair value of a debt security is below its carrying amount, we consider the decline to be other-than-temporary and record a charge to earnings if any of the following factors apply:

·

we have the intent to sell the security.

·

it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before maturity or recovery.

·

we do not expect to recover the security’s entire amortized cost basis, even if there is no intent to sell the security.

In general, we use the first in, first out method to determine the cost basis on sales of marketable investment securities.

Accounts Receivable

Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non-collectability of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors.  However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value.  Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.  We depend on EchoStar for the production of our receivers and many components of our receiver systems.  Manufactured inventory includes materials, labor, freight-in, royalties and manufacturing overhead.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost.  The costs of satellites under construction, including certain amounts prepaid under our satellite service agreements, are capitalized during the construction phase, assuming the eventual successful launch and in-orbit operation of the satellite.  If a satellite were to fail during launch or while in-orbit, the resultant loss would be charged to expense in the period such loss was incurred.  The amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds estimated to be received, if any.  Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over useful lives ranging from one to forty years.  Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when incurred.  Renewals and improvements that add value or extend the asset’s useful life are capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets and identifiable finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group.  For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset would be impaired if the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its

F-10


DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

undiscounted future net cash flows.  Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment is reported as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value as estimated using discounted cash flows.  Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  We consider relevant cash flow, estimated future operating results, trends and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets are recoverable.

Other Intangible Assets

We do not amortize indefinite lived intangible assets, but test these assets for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairments arise.  Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment as described above for long-lived assets.  Our intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of FCC licenses.  Generally, we have determined that our FCC licenses have indefinite useful lives due to the following:

·

FCC spectrum is a non-depleting asset;

·

Existing DBS licenses are integral to our business and will contribute to cash flows indefinitely;

·

Replacement satellite applications are generally authorized by the FCC subject to certain conditions, without substantial cost under a stable regulatory, legislative and legal environment;

·

Maintenance expenditures to obtain future cash flows are not significant;

·

DBS licenses are not technologically dependent; and

·

We intend to use these assets indefinitely.

We combine all our indefinite lived FCC licenses into a single unit of accounting, except for 700 MHz wireless licenses (see Note 8).  The analysis encompasses future cash flows from satellites transmitting from such licensed orbital locations, including revenue attributable to programming offerings from such satellites, the direct operating and subscriber acquisition costs related to such programming, and future capital costs for replacement satellites.  Projected revenue and cost amounts include current and projected subscribers.  In conducting our annual impairment test in 2010, we determined that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses, calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded their carrying amounts.

Other Investment Securities

Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting.  Because these equity securities are generally not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment.  Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy.  The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and thes
e changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.  When impairments occur related to our foreign investments, any  cumulative translation adjustment associated with these investments will remain in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit)” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the investments are sold or otherwise liquidated; at which time, they will be released into our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Long-Term Deferred Revenue, Distribution and Carriage Payments

Certain programmers provide us up-front payments.  Such amounts are deferred and recognized as reductions to “Subscriber-related expenses” on a straight-line basis over the relevant remaining contract term (generally up to 10 years).  The current and long-term portions of these deferred credits are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Deferred revenue and other” and “Long-term deferred revenue, distribution and carriage payments and other long-term liabilities,” respectively.

Sales Taxes

We account for sales taxes imposed on our goods and services on a net basis in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Since we primarily act as an agent for the governmental authorities, the amount charged to the customer is collected and remitted directly to the appropriate jurisdictional entity.

Income Taxes

We establish a provision for income taxes currently payable or receivable and for income tax amounts deferred to future periods.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of differences that exist between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances when we believe it is more likely than not that such net deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

From time to time, we engage in transactions where the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty.  We record a liability when, in management’s judgment, a tax filing position does not meet the more likely than not threshold.  For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, we may record a liability depending on management’s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled.  We adjust our estimates periodically for ongoing examinations by and settlements with various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.  We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” and “Other, net,” respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents, marketable investment securities, trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and current liabilities is equal to or approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.

Fair values for our publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices.  The fair values of our private debt is estimated based on an analysis in which we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information.  In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions, among other things, regarding credit spreads, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes.  See Note 9 for the fair value of our long-term debt.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

Costs of issuing debt are generally deferred and amortized to interest expense ratably over the terms of the respective notes (see Note 9).

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, prices are determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered.  Revenue from our subscription television services is recognized when programming is broadcast to subscribers.  Payments received from subscribers in advance of the broadcast or service period are recorded as “Deferred revenue and other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until earned.

For certain of our promotions relating to our receiver systems and HD programming, subscribers are charged an upfront fee.  A portion of this fee may be deferred and recognized over the estimated subscriber life for new subscribers or the estimated remaining life for existing subscribers ranging from 18 months to five years.  Revenue from advertising sales is recognized when the related services are performed.

Subscriber fees for equipment rental, including DVRs, additional outlets and fees for receivers with multiple tuners, and our in-home service operations are recognized as revenue as earned.  Revenue from equipment sales and equipment upgrades are recognized upon shipment to customers.

Certain of our existing and new subscriber promotions include programming discounts.  Programming revenues are recorded as earned at the discounted monthly rate charged to the subscriber.  See “Subscriber Acquisition Costs” below for discussion regarding the accounting for costs under these promotions.

Subscriber-Related Expenses

The cost of television programming distribution rights is generally incurred on a per subscriber basis and various upfront carriage payments are recognized when the related programming is distributed to subscribers.  Recently, we entered into long-term flat rate programming contracts that are charged to expense using the straight-line method over the term of the agreement.  In addition, the cost of television programming rights to distribute live sporting events for a season or tournament is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the course of the season or tournament.  “Subscriber-related expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to receiver systems, 
subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses.  These costs are recognized as the services are performed or as incurred.

Subscriber Acquisition Costs

Subscriber acquisition costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) consist of costs incurred to acquire new subscribers through third parties and our direct sales distribution channel.  Subscriber acquisition costs include the following line items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss):

·

“Cost of sales — subscriber promotion subsidies - EchoStar”

includes the cost of our receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment and receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers.

·

“Other subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes net costs related to promotional incentives and costs related to installation.

·

“Subscriber acquisition advertising”

includes advertising and marketing expenses related to the acquisition of new DISH Network subscribers.  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

We characterize amounts paid to our independent dealers as consideration for equipment installation services and for equipment buydowns (incentives and rebates) as a reduction of revenue.  We expense payments for equipment installation services as “Other subscriber promotion subsidies.”  Our payments for equipment buydowns represent a partial or complete return of the dealer’s purchase price and are, therefore, netted against

F-13


DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

the proceeds received from the dealer.  We report the net cost from our various sales promotions through our independent dealer network as a component of “Other subscriber promotion subsidies.”  Net proceeds from the sale of subscriber related equipment pursuant to our subscriber acquisition promotions are not recognized as revenue.

Equipment Lease Programs

DISH Network subscribers have the choice of leasing or purchasing the satellite receiver and other equipment necessary to receive our programming.  Most of our new subscribers choose to lease equipment and thus we retain title to such equipment.  Equipment leased to new and existing subscribers is capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar because their sales and purchases are predominantly denominated in that currency.  However, for our subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate and revenues and expenses based on the exchange rates at the time such transactions arise, if known, or at the average rate for the period.  The difference is recorded to equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  Financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction and subsequent gains and losses related to changes in the foreign currency are included in “Other, net” income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations an
d Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Net transaction gains (losses) during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue Recognition — Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-13 (“ASU 2009-13”), Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.  ASU 2009-13 changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price.  This standard is effective January 1, 2011.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-13 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

3.         Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share

We present both basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS.  Basic EPS excludes potential dilution and is computed by dividing “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders” by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock awards were exercised and convertible securities were converted to common stock.

The potential dilution from our subordinated notes convertible into common stock was computed using the “if converted method.”  The potential dilution from stock awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average market value of our Class A common stock.  The following table presents earnings per share amounts for all periods and the basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation.

(1)

Effective as of close of business on January 15, 2008, the conversion price was adjusted to $60.25 per share (8,298,755 shares) as a result of the Spin-off.

(2)

Effective as of close of business on January 15, 2008, the conversion price was adjusted to $51.88 per share (481,881 shares) as a result of the Spin-off.

As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were stock awards to purchase 10.8 million, 8.9 million and 4.9 million shares, respectively, of Class A common stock outstanding, not included in the weighted-average common shares outstanding above, as their effect is antidilutive.

Vesting of options and rights to acquire shares of our Class A common stock (“Restricted Performance Units”) granted pursuant to our performance-based stock incentive plans is contingent upon meeting certain goals which are not yet probable of being achieved.  As a consequence, the following are also not included in the diluted EPS calculation.

Marketable Investment Securities

O

ur marketable investment securities portfolio consists of various debt and equity instruments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale (see Note 2).

Current Marketable Investment Securities - VRDNs

Variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”) are long-term floating rate municipal bonds with embedded put options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest.  All of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source.  Our VRDN portfolio is comprised of investments in many municipalities, which are backed by financial institutions or other highly rated companies that serve as the pledged liquidity source.  While they are classified as marketable investment securities, the put option allows VRDNs to be liquidated generally on a same day or on a five business day settlement basis.

Current Marketable Investment Securities - Strategic

Our current strategic marketable investment securities include strategic and financial investments in public companies that are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility.  As of December 31, 2010, a significant portion of our strategic investment portfolio consisted of securities of several issuers, and the value of that portfolio depends on those issuers.

We account for certain debt securities acquired at a discount under the cost recovery method, partial accrual or full accrual methods based on management’s quarterly evaluation of these securities.  These debt securities were purchased at a discount due to their credit quality.  As a result, the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) is limited to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted expected principal,

interest, and other cash flows (including the effects of prepayments) expected to be collected over our initial

investment.  The face value of these securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $16 million and $137 million, respectively.  The carrying value, which is equal to fair value, of these securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $16 million and $80 million, respectively.  The total discount on these securities was $3 million a
s of December 31, 2010 with $3 million classified as accretable yield.  The total discount on these securities was $91 million as of December 31, 2009 with $12 million classified as accretable yield and the remaining $79 million classified as non-accretable yield.  As a result of current developments, in December 2010, we reclassified our $56 million investment in DBSD North America’s 7.5% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2009 from current assets included in “Marketable investment securities” to noncurrent assets included in “Marketable and other investment securities.”

Current Marketable Investment Securities - Other

Our c

urrent marketable investment securities portfolio includes investments in various debt instruments including corporate and government bonds.

Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our restricted marketable investment securities, together with our restricted cash, included amounts required as collateral for our letters of credit or surety bonds.  Restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $62 million related to our litigation with Tivo, respectively.

Noncurrent Marketable Investment Securities — ARS and MBS

We have investments in ARS and MBS which are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value.  Events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ARS and MBS investments.  As a result, we classify these investments as noncurrent assets, as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature.  See below for further discussion on the July 1, 2010 fair value election on certain ARS investments.

F-17


DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

The valuation of our ARS and MBS investments portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to estimate.  Due to the lack of observable market quotes for identical assets, we utilize analyses that rely on Level 2 and/or Level 3 inputs, as defined in “Fair Value Measurements.”  These inputs include, among other things, observed prices on similar assets as well as our assumptions and estimates related to the counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security and overall capital market liquidity.  These securities were also compared, when possible, to other observable market data for financial instruments with similar characteristics.

Fair Value Election.

As of December 31, 2010, our ARS and MBS noncurrent marketable investment securities portfolio of $119 million includes $63 million of securities accounted for under the fair value method.  In March 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-11 (“ASU 2010-11”), Derivatives and Hedging:  Scope Exception Related to Embedded Credit Derivatives.  ASU 2010-11 clarifies the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from certain bifurcation requirements.  Only one form of embedded credit derivative qualifies for the exemption - one that is related to the subordination of one financial instrument to another.  As a result, entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than subordination may need to separately a
ccount for the embedded credit derivative feature.  On July 1, 2010, we elected to apply the fair value option to certain of our ARS portfolio impacted by ASU 2010-11.  As a result, a $50 million loss, net of tax, related to these ARS in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit)” as of June 30, 2010 was included as a cumulative-effect adjustment to “Accumulated earnings (deficit).”  All changes in the fair value of these investments after June 30, 2010 are recognized in our results of operations and included in “Other, net” income and expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and detailed in the table titled “Gains and Losses on Sales and Changes in Carrying Value of Investments” below.

Other Investment Securities

We have a few strategic investments in certain debt and equity securities that are included in noncurrent “Marketable and other investment securities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets accounted for using the cost, equity and/or fair value methods of accounting.

As a result of current developments, in December 2010, we reclassified our $56 million investment in DBSD North America’s 7.5% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2009 from current assets included in “Marketable investment securities” to noncurrent assets included in “Marketable and other investment securities.” The face value of these securities as of December 31, 2010 was $112 million.  In addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held a $47 million line of credit pursuant to the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2008 between us and DBSD North America.  See Note 18 for further discussion.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies’ businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans.  Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Marketable Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had accumulated net unrealized gains of $93 million and net unrealized losses of $3 million, both net of related tax effect, respectively, as a part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit).”  A full valuation allowance has been established against any deferred taxes that are capital in nature.  The components of our available-for-sale investments are detailed in the table below.

As of December 31, 2010, restricted and non-restricted marketable investment securities include debt securities of $2.069 billion with contractual maturities of one year or less and $273 million with contractual maturities greater than one year.  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as a result of our ability to sell these securities prior to maturity.

Marketable Investment Securities in a Loss Position

The following table reflects the length of time that the individual securities, accounted for as available-for-sale, have been in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by investment category.  As of December 31, 2010, the unrealized losses on our investments in equity securities represent investments in a company in the technology industry.  We are not aware of any specific factors which indicate the unrealized losses in these investments are due to anything other than temporary market fluctuations.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the unrealized losses on our investments in debt securities primarily represent investments in auction rate, mortgage and asset-backed securities.  We do not intend to sell our investments in these debt securities before they recover or mature, and it is more likely than not that we will hold these investments until that time.  In addition, we a
re not aware of any specific factors indicating that the underlying issuers of these debt securities would not be able to pay interest as it becomes due or repay the principal at maturity.  Therefore, we believe that these changes in the estimated fair values of these marketable investment securities are related to temporary market fluctuations.

Fair Value Measurements

We determine fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Market or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.  We apply the following hierarchy in determining fair value:

·

Level 1, defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;

·

Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

·

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other participants therefore requiring assumptions based on the best information available.

EchoStar XIV

.

Our EchoStar XIV satellite was launched on March 20, 2010 and commenced commercial operations at the 119 degree orbital location during May 2010.  EchoStar XIV has both spot beam capabilities and the ability to provide service to the entire continental United States (“CONUS”) that has allowed us, among other things, to expand our HD offerings.

EchoStar XV

.

Our EchoStar XV satellite was launched on July 10, 2010 and commenced commercial operations at the 61.5 degree orbital location during August 2010.  EchoStar XV is a CONUS satellite that has allowed us, among other things, to expand our HD offerings.  EchoStar XV is expected to be used as an in-orbit spare when EchoStar XVI commences commercial operations during the second half of 2012.

Satellite Anomalies

Operation of our programming service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer.  Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming, particularly by expanding local HD coverage and offering more HD national channels.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.  Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Prior to 2010, certain satellites in our fleet experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful life and/or commercial operation.  There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not further impact the remaining useful life and/or commercial operation of any of these satellites.  See “

Long-Lived Satellite Assets

” below for further discussion of evaluation of impairment.  There can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail.  We do not anticipate carrying insurance for any of the in-orbit satellites that we use, and we will bear the risk associated with any in-orbit satellite failures.  Recent developments with respect to certain of our satellites are discussed below.

Owned Satellites

EchoStar VII.

EchoStar VII, which is being used as an in-orbit spare, was designed with four gyros, of which three are required to properly control the positioning of the satellite.  During October 2010, EchoStar VII experienced an anomaly which caused one of its gyros to temporarily stop functioning.  Testing during December 2010 confirmed that this gyro is functioning again.  In addition, during July 2010, EchoStar VII experienced a thruster anomaly.  Thrusters control spacecraft location and maintain spacecraft pointing.  While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years or impact commercial operation of the satellite, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not reduce its useful life or impact its comme
rcial operation.

EchoStar X

.

EchoStar X was designed with 49 spot beams which use up to 42 active 140 watt traveling wave tube amplifiers (“TWTAs”) and 24 solar array circuits, of which approximately 22 are required to assure full power for the original minimum 12-year useful life of the satellite.  During May and September of 2010, EchoStar X experienced anomalies which affected seven solar array circuits reducing the number of functional solar array circuits to 17.  While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years or impact commercial operation of the satellite based on the satellite’s current configuration, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not red
uce its useful life or impact its commercial operation.

Leased Satellites

EchoStar VI.

EchoStar VI was designed with 108 solar array strings, of which approximately 102 are required to assure full power availability for the original minimum 12-year useful life of the satellite.  During March and August of 2010,

EchoStar VI experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of 24 solar array strings, reducing the number of functional solar array strings to 84. While these anomalies did not reduce the estimated useful life of the satellite to less than 12 years, commercial operation has been impacted and there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not reduce its useful life or further impact its commercial operation.  The satellite was designed to operate 32 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16 DBS transponder
s operating at approximately 250 watts per channel.  The power reduction resulting from the solar array failures currently limits us to operating 24 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 12 DBS transponders operating at approximately 250 watts per channel.  The number of transponders to which power can be provided is expected to decline in the future at the rate of approximately one transponder every three years.

EchoStar VIII

.  EchoStar VIII was designed to operate 32 DBS transponders in CONUS at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 DBS transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per channel.  EchoStar VIII was also designed with spot-beam technology.  This satellite has experienced several anomalies prior to 2011, but none have reduced its useful life or impacted its commercial operation.  During January 2011, the satellite experienced an anomaly, which temporarily disrupted electrical power to some components causing an interruption of broadcast service.  Testing is being performed to determine if this anomaly will reduce the satellite’s useful life or impact its commercial operations.  There can be no assurance that this anomaly or any future anomalies will n
ot reduce its useful life or impact its commercial operation.

Long-Lived Satellite Assets.

We evaluate our satellite fleet for impairment as one asset group and test for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  While certain of the anomalies discussed above, and previously disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of an individual satellite, based on the redundancy designed within each satellite and considering the asset grouping, these anomalies are not considered to be significant events that would require evaluation for impairment recognition.  Unless and until a specific satellite is abandoned or otherwise determined to have no service potential, the net carrying amount related to the satellite would not be written off.

FCC Authorizations.

We currently do not have any satellites positioned at the 148 degree orbital location as a result of the retirement of EchoStar V.  While we have requested the necessary approval from the FCC for the continued use of this orbital location, there can be no assurance that the FCC will determine that our proposed future use of this orbital location complies fully with all licensing requirements.  If the FCC decides to revoke this license, we may be required to write-off its $68 million carrying value.

8.      700 MHz Wireless Licenses

In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009.  To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly.  Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements.  We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance.  In conducting our annual impairment test in 2010, we determined that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses, calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded their carrying amount.  Based on this assessment, this asset was not impaired a
s of December 31, 2010.

Other Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations

Other long-term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the following:

Capital Lease Obligations

Anik F3.

Anik F3, an FSS satellite, was launched and commenced commercial operation during April 2007.  This satellite is accounted for as a capital lease and depreciated over the term of the satellite service agreement.  We have leased 100% of the Ku-band capacity on Anik F3 for a period of 15 years.

Ciel II

.  Ciel II, a Canadian DBS satellite, was launched in December 2008 and commenced commercial operation during February 2009.  This satellite is accounted for as a capital lease and depreciated over the term of the satellite service agreement.  We have leased 100% of the capacity on Ciel II for an initial ten-year term.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $500 million capitalized for the estimated fair value of satellites acquired under capital leases included in “Property and equipment, net,” with related accumulated depreciation of $109 million and $66 million, respectively.  In our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), we recognized $43 million, $40 million and $15 million in depreciation expense on satellites acquired under capital lease agreements during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

10.    Income Taxes and Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

Income Taxes

Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as probable operating loss, tax credit and other carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances when we believe it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will not be realized.  We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance.  Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about historical financial information as well as the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities.

As of December 31, 2010, we had no net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for federal income tax purposes and $13 million of NOL benefit for state income tax purposes.  The state NOLs begin to expire in the year 2020.  In addition, there are $11 million of tax benefits related to credit carryforwards which are partially offset by a valuation allowance and $42 million of capital loss carryforwards which were fully offset by a valuation allowance. The credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2011.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In addition to filing federal income tax returns, we and one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in all states that impose an income tax and a small number of foreign jurisdictions where we have immaterial operations.  We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years beginning in 1996 due to the carryover of previously incurred net operating losses.  As of December 31, 2010, no taxing authority has proposed any significant adjustments to our tax positions.  We have no significant current tax examinations in process.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

We have $171 million in unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, could favorably affect our effective tax rate.  We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months.

Accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of “Other, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $3 million in interest and penalty benefit to earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $9 million and $6 million in interest and penalty expense to earnings, respectively.  Accrued interest and penalties were $13 million and $16 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The above table excludes these amounts.

Common Stock

The Class A, Class B and Class C common stock are equivalent except for voting rights.  Holders of Class A and Class C common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Each share of Class B and Class C common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A common stock.  Upon a change in control of DISH Network, each holder of outstanding shares of Class C common stock is entitled to 10 votes for each share of Class C common stock held.  Our principal stockholder owns the majority of all outstanding Class B common stock and, together with all other stockholders, owns outstanding Class A common stock.  There are no shares of Class C common stock outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock.  On November 2, 2010, our Board of Directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan, such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of our Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2010, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion under the plan.

The following table provides information regarding repurchases of our Class A common stock.

Cash Dividend

On December 2, 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $2.00 per share, or approximately $894 million, on our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20, 2009.

12.    Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Our employees participate in the DISH Network employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), in which we are authorized to issue 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock.  At December 31, 2010, we had 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock which remain available for issuance under this plan.  Substantially all full-time employees who have been employed by us for at least one calendar quarter are eligible to participate in the ESPP.  Employee stock purchases are made through payroll deductions.  Under the terms of the ESPP, employees may not deduct an amount which would permit such employee to purchase our capital stock under all of our stock purchase plans at a rate which would exceed $25,000 in fair value of capital stock in any one year.  The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the last business day of 
each calendar quarter in which such shares of Class A common stock are deemed sold to an employee under the ESPP.  During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, employee purchases of Class A common stock through the ESPP totaled approximately 0.1 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively.

Voluntary employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be matched 50% by us, subject to a maximum annual contribution of $1,500 per employee.  Forfeitures of unvested participant balances which are retained by the 401(k) Plan may be used to fund matching and discretionary contributions.  We also may make an annual discretionary contribution to the plan with approval by our Board of Directors, subject to the maximum deductible limit provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  These contributions may be made in cash or in our stock.

The following table summarizes the expense associated with our matching contributions and discretionary contributions:

13.    Stock-Based Compensation

Stock Incentive Plans

We maintain stock incentive plans to attract and retain officers, directors and key employees.  Stock awards under these plans include both performance and non-performance based stock incentives.  As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding under these plans stock options to acquire 21.9 million shares of our Class A common stock and 1.6 million restricted stock units.  Stock options granted prior to and on December 31, 2010 were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the market value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant and with a maximum term of approximately ten years.  While historically we have issued stock awards subject to vesting, typically at the rate of 20% per year, some stock awards have been granted with immediate vesting and other stock awards vest only upon the achievement of certain company-wide objectives.  As of December&n
bsp;31, 2010, we had 76.2 million shares of our Class A common stock available for future grant under our stock incentive plans.

During December 2009, we paid a dividend in cash of $2.00 per share on our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on November 20, 2009.  In light of such dividend, during February 2010, the exercise price of 20.6 million stock options, affecting approximately 700 employees, was reduced by $2.00 per share (the “Stock Option Adjustment”).  Except as noted below, all information discussed below reflects the Stock Option Adjustment.

In connection with the Spin-off, as permitted by our existing stock incentive plans and consistent with the Spin-off exchange ratio, each DISH Network stock option was converted into two stock options as follows:

·

an adjusted DISH Network stock option for the same number of shares that were exercisable under the original DISH Network stock option, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the original DISH Network stock option multiplied by 0.831219.

·

a new EchoStar stock option for one-fifth of the number of shares that were exercisable under the original DISH Network stock option, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the original DISH Network stock option multiplied by 0.843907.

DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

Similarly, each holder of DISH Network restricted stock units retained his or her DISH Network restricted stock units and received one EchoStar restricted stock unit for every five DISH Network restricted stock units that they held.

Consequently, the fair value of the DISH Network stock award and the new EchoStar stock award immediately following the Spin-off was equivalent to the fair value of such stock award immediately prior to the Spin-off.

As of December 31, 2010, the following stock awards were outstanding:

We are responsible for fulfilling all stock awards related to DISH Network common stock and EchoStar is responsible for fulfilling all stock awards related to EchoStar common stock, regardless of whether such stock awards are held by our or EchoStar’s employees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, our stock-based compensation expense, resulting from stock awards outstanding at the Spin-off date, is based on the stock awards held by our employees regardless of whether such stock awards were issued by DISH Network or EchoStar.  Accordingly, stock-based compensation that we expense with respect to EchoStar stock awards is included in “Additional paid-in capital” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Exercise prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

Vesting of these Restricted Performance Units is contingent upon meeting certain company goals which are not yet probable of being achieved.  See discussion of the 2005 LTIP, 2008 LTIP and other employee performance awards below.

Long-Term Performance-Based Plans

2005 LTIP.

During 2005, we adopted a long-term, performance-based stock incentive plan (the “2005 LTIP”).  The 2005 LTIP provides stock options and restricted stock units, either alone or in combination, which vest over seven years at the rate of 10% per year during the first four years, and at the rate of 20% per year thereafter.  Exercise of the stock awards is subject to a performance condition that a company-specific subscriber goal is achieved by March 31, 2015.

Contingent compensation related to the 2005 LTIP will not be recorded in our financial statements unless and until management concludes achievement of the performance condition is probable.  Given the competitive nature of our business, small variations in subscriber churn, gross new subscriber addition rates and certain other factors can significantly impact subscriber growth.  Consequently, while it was determined that achievement of the goal was not probable as of December 31, 2010, that assessment could change at any time.

If all of the stock awards under the 2005 LTIP were vested and the goal had been met or if we had determined that achievement of the goal was probable during the year ended December 31, 2010, we would have recorded total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for our employees as indicated in the table below.  If the goal is met and there are unvested stock awards at that time, the vested amounts would be expensed immediately on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), with the unvested portion recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.

2008 LTIP.

During 2008, we adopted a long-term, performance-based stock incentive plan (the “2008 LTIP”).  The 2008 LTIP provides stock options and restricted stock units, either alone or in combination, which vest based on company-specific subscriber and financial goals.  Exercise of the stock awards is contingent on achieving these goals by December 31, 2015.

Although no awards vest until the company attains the performance goals, compensation related to the 2008 LTIP will be recorded based on management’s assessment of the probability of meeting the remaining goals.  If the remaining goals are probable of being achieved, we will begin recognizing the associated non-cash, stock-based compensation expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) over the estimated period to achieve the goal.  See table below titled “Estimated Remaining Non-Cash, Stock-Based Compensation Expense.”

We determined that 25% of the 2008 LTIP performance goals were probable of achievement, of which 10% of the goals have been fully achieved.  As a result, we recorded non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as indicated in the table below titled “Non-Cash, Stock-Based Compensation Expense Recognized.”

Other Employee Performance Awards.

In addition to the above long-term, performance stock incentive plans, we have other stock awards that vest based on certain other company-specific subscriber and financial goals.  Exercise of these stock awards is contingent on achieving certain performance goals.

Additional compensation related to these awards will be recorded based on management’s assessment of the probability of meeting the remaining performance goals.  If the remaining goals are probable of being achieved, we will begin recognizing the associated non-cash, stock-based compensation expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) over the estimated period to achieve the goal.  See table below titled “Estimated Remaining Non-Cash, Stock-Based Compensation Expense.”

Although no awards vest until the performance goals are attained, we determined that certain goals were probable of achievement and, as a result, recorded non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as indicated in the table below titled “Non-Cash, Stock-Based Compensation Expense Recognized.”

Given the competitive nature of our business, small variations in subscriber churn, gross new subscriber addition rates and certain other factors can significantly impact subscriber growth.  Consequently, while it was determined that achievement of certain company-specific subscriber and financial goals was not probable as of December 31, 2010, that assessment could change at any time.

(1)  Certain long-term, performance stock awards expired without vesting during the first quarter of 2011.  As a result, the non-cash, stock-based compensation expense associated with those awards is excluded from this table.

Of the 21.9 million stock options and 1.6 million restricted stock units outstanding under our stock incentive plans as of December 31, 2010, the following awards were outstanding pursuant to our performance-based stock incentive plans:

Stock-Based Compensation

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $3 million of additional non-cash, stock-based compensation cost in connection with the Stock Option Adjustment discussed previously.  This amount is included in the table below.  Total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for all of our employees is shown in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and was allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation for such employees:

As of December 31, 2010, our total unrecognized compensation cost related to our non-performance based unvested stock awards was $20 million and includes compensation expense that we will recognize for EchoStar stock awards held by our employees as a result of the Spin-off.  This cost is based on an estimated future forfeiture rate of approximately 3.7% per year and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.  Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on stock awards

ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on share-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.

Valuation

The fair value of each stock award for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was estimated at the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions:

In December 2009, we paid a $2.00 cash dividend per share on our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock.  While we currently do not intend to declare additional dividends on our common stock, we may elect to do so from time to time.  Accordingly, the dividend yield percentage used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model is set at zero for all periods.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded stock options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  Consequently, our estimate of fair value may differ from other valuation models.  Further, the Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions.  Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.  Therefore, we do not believe the existing models provide a
s reliable a single measure of the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as a market-based model would.

We will continue to evaluate the assumptions used to derive the estimated fair value of our stock options as new events or changes in circumstances become known.

14.    Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

As of December 31, 2010, future maturities of our long-term debt, capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows:

The “Satellite-related obligations” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 as filed on March 1, 2010 inadvertently excluded the EchoStar XVI ten-year satellite lease commitment, which was agreed to in December 2009, and is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2012.  The obligations associated with this lease would have increased the previously reported “Satellite-related obligations” during 2012, 2013, 2014, and thereafter by approximately $18 million, $72 million, $72 million and $553 million, respectively.  These amounts are included in the table above.

F-42


DISH NETWORK CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed.  These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

The table above does not include $193 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued, as discussed in Note 10 and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010.  We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months.

The table above does not include the $87.5 million associated with the Credit Facility we entered into with DBSD North America on February 1, 2011.  The Credit Facility remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.  In addition, on February 1, 2011 we committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America’s existing debt.  This amount is also not included in the table above.  This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America’s emergence from bankruptcy.  See Note 18 for further discussion.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites Under Construction.

As of December 31, 2010, we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from EchoStar that are currently under construction.  Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under “Satellite-related obligations.”

·

QuetzSat-1.

During 2008, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease capacity on QuetzSat-1, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2011.

·

EchoStar XVI.

During December 2009, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease all of the capacity on EchoStar XVI, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2012.

Guarantees

In connection with the Spin-off, we distributed certain satellite lease agreements to EchoStar and remained the guarantor under those capital leases for payments totaling approximately $290 million over approximately the next four years that are not included in the table above.

In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, EchoStar entered into a new satellite transponder service agreement for Nimiq 5 through 2024.  We sublease this capacity from EchoStar and also guarantee a certain portion of its obligation under this agreement through 2019.  As of December 31, 2010, the remaining obligation under this agreement, including the guarantee of $553 million, is included in the table above.

As of December 31, 2010, we have not recorded a liability on the balance sheet for any of these guarantees.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2011 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment, digital broadcast operations, satellite and transponder leases, engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network.  Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content.  Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management’s control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content.  These programming commitments are not included in the “Commitments” table above.  The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases.  Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base.  In addition, our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.

Rent Expense

Total rent expense for operating leases was $263 million, $189 million and $204 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now have and may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services directly or indirectly related to those that we offer.  We may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property rights that our products may potentially infringe.  Damages in patent infringement cases can include a tripling of actual damages in certain cases.  Further, we cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others and the availability and cost of any such licenses.  Various parties have asserted patent and other intellectual property rights with respect to components within our direct broadcast satellite system.  We cannot be certain that these persons do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe 
on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

Contingencies

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a separation agreement with EchoStar, which provides, among other things, for the division of certain liabilities, including liabilities resulting from litigation.  Under the terms of the separation agreement, EchoStar has assumed certain liabilities that relate to its business including certain designated liabilities for acts or omissions prior to the Spin-off.  Certain specific provisions govern intellectual property related claims under which, generally, EchoStar will only be liable for its acts or omissions following the Spin-off and we will indemnify EchoStar for any liabilities or damages resulting from intellectual property claims relating to the period prior to the Spin-off as well as our acts or omissions following the Spin-off.

Acacia

During 2004, Acacia Media Technologies (“Acacia”) filed a lawsuit against us and EchoStar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast, Charter, Cox and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants.  Acacia is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.  The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992; 5,253,275; 5,550,863; 6,002,720; and 6,144,702, which relate to certain systems and methods for transmission of digital data.  On September 25, 2009, the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on invalidity grounds, and dismissed the action with prejudice.  On October 8, 2010, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.  Acacia may no longer appeal this dism
issal since their time to seek en banc review with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals or petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari has now expired.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

During 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. (“Broadcast Innovation”) filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV, Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in United States District Court in Denver, Colorado.  Broadcast Innovation is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.  The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the ‘066 patent).  The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data.  The ‘066 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on removable cards.  Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving us as the only defendant.

During 2004, the District Court issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid.  Also in 2004, the District Court found the ‘094 patent invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter and Comcast.  In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned that finding of invalidity with respect to the ‘094 patent and remanded the Charter case back to the District Court.  During June 2006, Charter filed a reexamination request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  The District Court has stayed the Charter case pending reexamination, and our case has been stayed pending resolution of the Charter case.

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Channel Bundling Class Action

During 2007, a purported class of cable and satellite subscribers filed an antitrust action against us in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The suit also names as defendants DirecTV, Comcast, Cablevision, Cox, Charter, Time Warner, Inc., Time Warner Cable, NBC Universal, Viacom, Fox Entertainment Group and Walt Disney Company.  The suit alleges, among other things, that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to provide customers with access only to bundled channel offerings as opposed to giving customers the ability to purchase channels on an “a la carte” basis.  On October 16, 2009, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice.  The plaintiffs have appealed.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the ex
tent of any potential liability or damages.

ESPN

During 2008, we filed a lawsuit against ESPN, Inc., ESPN Classic, Inc., ABC Cable Networks Group, Soapnet L.L.C. and International Family Entertainment (collectively, “ESPN”) for breach of contract in New York State Supreme Court.  Our complaint alleges that ESPN failed to provide us with certain high-definition feeds of the Disney Channel, ESPN News, Toon and ABC Family.  ESPN asserted a counterclaim, and then filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that we owed approximately $35 million under the applicable affiliation agreements.  We brought a motion to amend our complaint to assert that ESPN was in breach of certain most-favored-nation provisions under the applicable affiliation agreements.  On April 15, 2009, the New York State Supreme Court granted our motion to amend the complaint, and granted, in part, ESPN’s motion on the counterclaim, finding tha
t we are liable for some of the amount alleged to be owing but that the actual amount owing is disputed.  We appealed the partial grant of ESPN’s motion to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  After the partial grant of ESPN’s motion, ESPN sought an additional $30 million under the applicable affiliation agreements.  On March 15, 2010, the New York State Supreme Court affirmed the prior grant of ESPN’s motion and ruled that we owe the full amount of approximately $65 million under the

applicable affiliation agreement.  There can be no assurance that ESPN will not seek, and that the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department will not award a higher amount. .  On December 29, 2010, the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed the partial grant of ESPN’s motion on the counterclaim.  However, it did not rule on the amount that we owe ESPN pursuant to its counterclaim.  The appellate court will determine this amount as part of a separate proceeding.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $42 million as a “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), which reflects our estimated exposure for ESPN’s counterclaim. We intend to vigorously prosecute
 and defend this case.

Finisar Corporation

Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) obtained a $100 million verdict in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against DirecTV for patent infringement.  Finisar, an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein, alleged that DirecTV’s electronic program guide and other elements of its system infringe United States Patent No. 5,404,505 (the ‘505 patent).

During 2006, we and EchoStar, together with NagraStar L.L.C., filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Finisar that asks the Court to declare that we do not infringe, and have not infringed, any valid claim of the ‘505 patent.  Finisar brought counterclaims against us, EchoStar and NagraStar alleging that we infringed the ‘505 patent.  During April 2008, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment against DirecTV and ordered a new trial.  On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of DirecTV and during January 2010, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment, and dismissed the action with prejudice.  Finisar then agreed to dismiss its counterclaims against us, EchoStar and NagraStar without prejudice.  We also agreed to dismiss our Decla
ratory Judgment action without prejudice.

Ganas L.L.C.

During August 2010, Ganas, L.L.C. (“Ganas”) filed suit against DISH DBS Corporation, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Sabre Holdings Corporation, SAP America, Inc., SAS Institute Inc., Scottrade, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., The Charles Schwab Corporation, Tivo Inc., Unicoi Systems Inc., Xerox Corporation, Adobe Systems Inc., AOL Inc., Apple Inc., Axibase Corporation, DirecTV, E*Trade Securities L.L.C., Exinda Networks, Fidelity Brokerage Services L.L.C., Firstrade Securities Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, iControl Inc., International Business Machines Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos.  7,136,913, 7,325,053, and 7,734,756.  The patents relate to hypertext transfer protocol and simple object access protocol.  Ganas is an entity t

Retailer Class Actions

During 2000, lawsuits were filed by retailers in Colorado state and federal courts attempting to certify nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our retailers.  The plaintiffs requested that the Courts declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged agreements between us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and payments, charge backs and other compensation.  On September 20, 2010, we agreed to a settlement of both lawsuits that provides, among other things, for mutual releases of the claims underlying the litigation, payment by us of up to $60 million, and the option for certain class members to elect to reinstate certain monthly incentive payments, which the parties agreed have an aggregate maximum value of $23 million.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty how many class members will elect to reinstate these monthly incen
tive payments.   As a result, we recorded $60 million as a “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in “Litigation expense” for the year ended December 31, 2010 on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  On February 9, 2011, the court granted final approval of the settlement; however, our payment of the settlement amount is still subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the lapse of all applicable appeal periods.

Tivo Inc.

During January 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the April 2006 jury verdict concluding that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs, infringed a patent held by Tivo.  As of September 2008, we had recorded a total accrual of $132 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the April 2006 jury verdict, supplemental damages through September 2006 and pre-judgment interest awarded by the Texas court, together with the estimated cost of potential further software infringement prior to implementation of our alternative technology, discussed below, plus interest subsequent to entry of the judgment.  In its January 2008 decision, the Federal Circuit affirmed the jury’s verdict of infringement on Tivo’s “software claims,” and upheld the award of damages from the District Cou
rt.  The Federal Circuit, however, found that we did not literally infringe Tivo’s “hardware claims,” and remanded such claims back to the District Court for further proceedings.  On October 6, 2008, the Supreme Court denied our petition for certiorari.  As a result, approximately $105 million of the total $132 million accrual was released from an escrow account to Tivo.

We also developed and deployed “next-generation” DVR software.  This improved software was automatically downloaded to our current customers’ DVRs, and is fully operational (our “original alternative technology”).  The download was completed as of April 2007.  We received written legal opinions from outside counsel that concluded our original alternative technology does not infringe, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, either the hardware or software claims of Tivo’s patent.  Tivo filed a motion for contempt alleging that we are in violation of the Court’s injunction.  We opposed this motion on the grounds that the injunction did not apply to DVRs that have received our original alternative technology, that our original alternative technology does not infringe Tivo’s patent, and that we were in compliance with the injunction.

In June 2009, the United States District Court granted Tivo’s motion for contempt, finding that our original alternative technology was not more than colorably different than the products found by the jury to infringe Tivo’s patent, that our original alternative technology still infringed the software claims, and that even if our original alternative technology was “non-infringing,” the original injunction by its terms required that we disable DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field.  The District Court also amended its original injunction to require that we inform the court of any further attempts to design around Tivo’s patent and seek approval from the court before any such design-around is implemented.  The District Court awarded Tivo $103 million in supplemental damages and interest for the period from September 2006
 through April 2008, based on an assumed $1.25 per subscriber per month royalty rate.  We posted a bond to secure that award pending appeal of the contempt order.  On July 1, 2009, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted a permanent stay of the District Court’s contempt order pending resolution of our appeal.

The District Court held a hearing on July 28, 2009 on Tivo’s claims for contempt sanctions.  Tivo sought up to $975 million in contempt sanctions for the period from April 2008 to June 2009 based on, among other things, profits Tivo alleges we made from subscribers using DVRs.  We opposed Tivo’s request arguing, among other things, that sanctions are inappropriate because we made good faith efforts to comply with the Court’s injunction.  We also challenged Tivo’s calculation of profits. On September 4, 2009, the District Court partially granted Tivo’s motion for contempt sanctions and awarded $2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the period from April 2008 to July 2009 (as compared to the award for supplemental damages for the prior period from September 2006 to April 2008, which was based on an assumed $1.25 per DVR subscriber per
 month).  By the District Court’s estimation, the total award for the period from April 2008 to July 2009 is approximately $200 million.  The District Court also awarded Tivo its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred during the contempt proceedings.  Enforcement of these awards has been stayed by the District Court pending resolution of our appeal of the underlying June 2009 contempt order.  On February 8, 2010, we and Tivo submitted a stipulation to the District Court that the attorneys’ fees and costs, including expert witness fees and costs, that Tivo incurred during the contempt proceedings amounted to $6 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, we increased our total accrual by $361 million to reflect the supplemental damages and interest for the period from implementation of our original alternative technology through April 2008 and for the estimated cost of alleged software infringement (including

contempt sanctions for the period from April 2008 through June 2009) for the period from April 2008 through December 2009 plus interest.  During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $124 million and $361 million, respectively, of “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not record any litigation expense related to this case.  Our total accrual at December 31, 2010 was $517 million and is included in “Litigation accrual” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In light of the District Court’s finding of contempt, and its description of the manner in which it believes our original alternative technology infringed the ‘389 patent, we are also developing and testing potential new alternative technology in an engineering environment.  As part of EchoStar’s development process, EchoStar downloaded several of our design-around options to less than 1,000 subscribers for “beta” testing.  On March 11, 2010, we requested that the District Court approve the implementation of one of our design-around options on an expedited basis.  There can be no assurance that the District Court will approve this request.

Oral argument on our appeal of the contempt ruling took place on November 2, 2009, before a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.  On March 4, 2010, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s contempt order in a 2-1 decision.  On May 14, 2010, our petition for en banc review of that decision by the full Federal Circuit was granted and the opinion of the three-judge panel was vacated.  Oral argument occurred on November 9, 2010.  There can be no assurance that the full Federal Circuit will reverse the decision of the three-judge panel.  Tivo has stated that it will seek additional damages for the period from June 2009 to the present.  Although we have accrued our best estimate of damages, contempt sanctions and interest through December 31, 2010, there can be no assurance that Tivo will not seek, and that the court will 
not award, an amount that exceeds our accrual.

On October 6, 2010, the Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”) issued an office action confirming the validity of certain of the software claims of United States Patent No. 6,233,389 (the ‘389 patent).  However, the PTO only confirmed the validity of the ‘389 patent after Tivo made statements that we believe narrow the scope of its claims.  The claims that were confirmed thus should not have the same scope as the claims that we were found to have infringed and which underlie the contempt ruling that we are now appealing.  Therefore, we believe that the PTO’s conclusions are relevant to the issues on appeal.  The PTO’s conclusions support our position that our original alternative technology does not infringe and that we acted in good faith to design around Tivo’s patent.

If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court’s ruling on Tivo’s motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality.  In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers.  Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services.  The 
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court’s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant.  Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further award of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009.  In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest.  Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital.  Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives.&#
160; We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings.</font></p>

In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material.

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court.  We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit.  EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar&#146;s $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar&#146;s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement.  We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote
ntial new alternative technology.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings (&#147;Voom&#148;) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service.  At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement.  The Court denied Voom&#146;s request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment.  Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions.  On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom&#146;s motions for discovery sanctions.  The Court&#146;s decision provides for an adverse inf
erence jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial.  We appealed the grant of Voom&#146;s motion for discovery sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.  On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.</font></p>

The fee for the services provided under this satellite capacity agreement depends, among other things, upon the orbital location of the satellite and the length of the lease.  The lease generally terminates upon the earlier of:  (i) the end of life or replacement of the satellite (unless EchoStar determines to renew on a year-to-year basis); (ii) the date the satellite fails; (iii) the date the transponder on which service is being provided fails; or (iv) a certain date, which depends, among other things, upon the estimated useful life of the satellite, whether the replacement satellite fails at launch or in orbit prio
r to being placed into service, and the exercise of certain renewal options.  EchoStar generally has the option to renew this lease on a year-to-year basis through the end of the satellite&#146;s life.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew this agreement will be exercised.</font></p>
