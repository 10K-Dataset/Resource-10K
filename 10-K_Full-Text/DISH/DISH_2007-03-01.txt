PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Our Business

EchoStar Communications Corporation, through its DISH Network, is a leading provider of satellite
delivered digital television to customers across the United States. DISH Network services include
hundreds of video, audio and data channels, interactive television channels, digital video
recording, high definition television, international programming, professional installation and
24-hour customer service.

We started offering subscription television services on the DISH Network in March 1996. As of
December 31, 2006, the DISH Network had approximately 13.105 million subscribers. We currently
have 14 owned or leased in-orbit satellites which enable us to offer over 2,500 video and audio
channels to consumers across the United States. Since we use many of these channels for local
programming, no particular consumer could subscribe to all channels, but all are available using
small consumer satellite antennae, or dishes. We believe that the DISH Network offers programming
packages that have a better “price-to-value” relationship than packages currently offered by most
other subscription television providers. We believe that there continues to be unsatisfied demand
for high quality, reasonably priced television programming services.

DISH Network and EchoStar Technologies Corporation

EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC”) is a holding company. Its subsidiaries (which together
with ECC are referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) operate two primary
interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k – which provides a direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription
television service in the United States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”)
– which designs and develops DBS receivers, antennae and other digital equipment for the DISH Network. We refer to this
equipment collectively as “EchoStar receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and
distributes similar equipment for international satellite service providers and others.

We have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS System.” The EchoStar DBS
System consists of our FCC authorized DBS and Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned
and leased satellites, EchoStar receiver systems, digital broadcast operations centers, customer
service facilities, in-home service and call center operations and certain other assets utilized in
our operations. Our principal business strategy is to continue developing our subscription
television service in the United States to provide consumers with a fully competitive alternative
to others in the multi-channel video programming distribution (“MVPD”) industry.

We will continue to focus on improving our competitive position and growing our business by
leveraging our satellite and engineering expertise to pursue complementary strategic initiatives.
These initiatives include offering fixed satellite service capacity on a wholesale commercial basis
(rather than direct to consumers) and continuing to develop and offer new products and services,
such as advanced interactive, home media and portable and mobile products and services. In
addition, we are considering various investment and other business opportunities domestically and
abroad, and this activity could continue to increase in 2007.

Other Information

We were organized in 1995 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our common stock
is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “DISH.” Our principal
executive offices are located at 9601 South Meridian Boulevard, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and our
telephone number is (303) 723-1000.



DISH NETWORK

Programming

Basic Programming Packages

.

We use a “value-based” strategy in structuring the content and pricing
of programming packages available from the DISH Network. For example, we currently offer our
“America’s Top 100” (“AT100”) package for $29.99 per month. This package includes over 100 of our
most popular digital video and audio channels. We estimate that cable operators would
typically charge over $45.00 per month, on average, for comparable service.

Our “America’s Top 200” (“AT200”) package, which we currently offer for $42.99 per month, is
similar to an expanded basic cable package, and includes over 200 of
our most popular digital video and
audio channels, including Sirius Music Channels. We estimate that cable operators would typically
charge over $55.00 per month, on average, for a similar package. In addition, most of our
customers are eligible for a $49.99 per month package that includes AT200, local channels and a
digital video recorder (“DVR”). We estimate that cable operators would typically charge over
$65.00 per month, on average, for a similar package.

Our “America’s Top 250” (“AT250”) package, which we currently offer for $52.99 per month, includes
over 250 digital video and audio channels, and our “America’s Everything Pak,” which combines our AT250 package and more
than 30 commercial-free premium movie channels including HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and Starz, is
currently offered for $89.99 per month.

We offer satellite-delivered local broadcast channels for an additional $5.00 per month in over 170
markets in the United States, representing over 96% of all of U.S. television households. Cable
operators typically include local channels in their programming packages at no additional cost.

Movie Packages

.

We offer HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Starz and other premium movie packages starting
at $12.99 per month and including as many as 10 channels. We believe many of our movie packages
are a better value than similar packages offered by most other multi-channel video providers.

High Definition Programming Packages

. We offer over 25 national high definition (“HD”) channels
for $20 per month, more than any other major pay TV provider in the United States. Further,
customers who subscriber to HBO, Showtime and Starz also receive an HD feed of those channels at no
additional cost. Similarly, customers who subscribe to standard definition local channels also
receive HD local channels, where available. We expect to offer HD local channels to more than 50
percent of U.S. households by the end of 2007.

DISH Latino Programming Packages

. We offer a variety of Spanish-language programming packages.
Our “DISH Latino” package includes more than 35 Spanish-language programming channels for $24.99
per month. We also offer “DISH Latino Dos,” which includes over 195 English and Spanish-language
programming channels for $36.99 per month. Our “DISH Latino Max” package includes more than 220
Spanish and English-language channels for $46.99 per month. Additionally, subscribers may add more
than 35 Spanish-language programming channels to any of our AT100, AT200 and AT250 packages for an
additional $12.49 per month.

Family-Friendly Programming Package

. Our DishFAMILY package offers over 40 “family- friendly”
channels including sports, news, children’s programming, lifestyle, hobbies, shopping and public
interest for $19.99 per month, or $24.99 including local channels. Comparatively, the family tier
package offered by most other pay TV providers is more than $30 per month.

International Programming

. We offer over 130 foreign-language channels including Arabic,
Portuguese, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Greek and many others. DISH Network remains the leader in
delivering foreign-language programming to customers in the United States, and our foreign-language
programming contributes significantly to our subscriber growth. Foreign-language programming is a
valuable niche product that attracts new subscribers to DISH Network who are unable to get similar
programming elsewhere, and while this niche is becoming more competitive, we will continue to
explore opportunities to add foreign-language programming.



Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Sales Channels

. While we offer receiver systems and programming directly, a majority of our new
subscriber acquisitions are generated by independent businesses offering our products and services,
including small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer
electronics stores, nationwide retailers, telecommunications providers and others.

We generally pay these independent businesses an incentive upon activation of each new subscriber
they acquire for us. We also typically pay them a small monthly incentive for up to 60 months
provided the customer continuously subscribes to our programming and the retailer achieves required
minimum subscriber acquisition goals.

Marketing

. We use print, radio and television, on a local and national basis, to advertise and
promote the DISH Network. We also offer point-of-sale literature, product displays, demonstration
kiosks and signage for retail outlets. We provide guides that describe DISH Network products and
services to our retailers and distributors and conduct periodic educational seminars. Our mobile
sales and marketing team visits retail outlets regularly to reinforce training and ensure that
these outlets have proper point-of-sale materials for our current promotions. Additionally, we
dedicate a DISH Network television channel and websites to provide retailers and customers with
information about special services and promotions that we offer from time to time.

Acquisition Strategy

. Our future success in the subscription television industry depends on, among
other factors, our ability to acquire and retain DISH Network subscribers. We provide varying
levels of subsidies and incentives to attract customers, including leased, free or subsidized
receiver systems, installations, programming and other items. This marketing strategy emphasizes
our long-term business strategy of maximizing future revenue by rapidly increasing our subscriber
base. Since we subsidize consumer up-front costs, we incur significant costs each time we acquire
a new subscriber. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that, on average, we will be able
to fully recoup the up-front costs of subscriber acquisition from future subscription television
services revenue.

DISH Network subscribers have the choice of purchasing or leasing the satellite receiver and other
equipment necessary to receive our programming. As a result of our promotions, most of our new
subscribers choose to lease their equipment, including receiver models that provide HD, DVR, HD DVR
and other advanced capabilities for multiple rooms. Many of these lease programs require the
consumer to commit to continue to subscribe to a qualifying programming package for 18 months.
Subscribers in our lease programs are required to return the receivers and certain other equipment
to us, or be charged for the equipment, if they terminate service. To the extent we successfully
retrieve and cost-effectively recondition and redeploy leased equipment from subscribers who
terminate service, we are able to reduce the cost of future new subscriber acquisition. However,
these cost savings are limited as technological advances and consumer demand for new features
result in the need to replace older equipment for customers over time.

We base our marketing promotions on, among other things, current competitive conditions. In some
cases, if competition increases, or we determine for any other reason that it is necessary to
increase our subscriber acquisition costs to attract new customers, our profitability and costs of
operation would be adversely affected.

Bundling Alliances

AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”) and other telecommunications providers offer DISH Network programming bundled
with broadband, telephony and other services. While these providers
in the aggregate currently account for less than 25% of our gross
subscriber additions, the loss of certain of these relationships
could have an adverse effect on our new subscriber additions to the
extent other distribution channels could not be developed in those
markets. During 2006, AT&T began deploying fiber-optic
networks that allow it to offer video services directly to millions of homes. Other
telecommunications companies have announced similar plans. Our net new subscriber additions and
certain of our other key operating metrics could be adversely affected to the extent AT&T
de-emphasizes, or discontinues altogether, its efforts to acquire DISH Network subscribers, and as
a result of competition from video services offered by AT&T or other telecommunications companies.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing significant new
bundling opportunities with other telecommunications companies.



Components of a DBS System

Overview

.

In order to provide programming services to DISH Network subscribers, we have entered
into agreements with video, audio and data programmers who generally make their programming content
available to our digital broadcast operations centers via commercial satellites or fiber optic
networks. We monitor those signals for quality, and can add promotional messages, public service
programming, advertising, and other information. Equipment at our digital broadcast operations
centers then digitizes, compresses, encrypts and combines the signal with other necessary data,
such as conditional access information. We then “uplink” or transmit the signals to one or more of
our satellites and broadcast directly to DISH Network subscribers.

In order to receive DISH Network programming, a subscriber needs:

•

a satellite antenna, which people sometimes refer to as a “dish,” and related components;

•

a satellite “receiver” or “set-top box,” and

•

a television.

EchoStar Receiver Systems

.

EchoStar receiver systems include a small satellite dish, a digital
satellite receiver that decrypts and decompresses signals for television viewing, a remote control
and other related components. We offer a number of receiver models. Our standard system comes
with an infrared universal remote control, an on-screen interactive program guide and V-chip type
technology for parental control. Our advanced models include a hard disk drive enabling additional
features such as digital video recording of up to 300 hours of programming. Certain of our
standard and premium systems allow independent satellite TV viewing on two separate televisions and
include UHF universal remotes, allowing control through walls when the satellite receiver and TV
are not located in the same room. We also offer a variety of specialized products including HD
receivers. Receivers communicate with our authorization center through telephone lines to,
among other things, report the purchase of pay-per-view movies and other events. During 2007, we
expect to begin offering DVRs capable of storing up to 500 hours of programming, with the
flexibility to further increase storage capacity by attaching external hard drives.

Although we internally design and engineer our receiver systems, we out-source manufacturing to
high-volume contract electronics manufacturers. We depend on a few manufacturers, and in some
cases a single manufacturer, for the production of our receivers and many components of the
EchoStar receiver systems that we provide to subscribers. Although there can be no assurance, we
do not believe that the loss of any single manufacturer would materially impact our business.
Sanmina-SCI Corporation and Jabil Circuit, Inc. currently
manufacture the majority of our receivers. DISH Network reception equipment is incompatible with our competitors’ systems.

Conditional Access System

.

Conditional access technology allows us to encrypt our programming so
only those who pay can receive it. We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards,
called “smart cards,” or in security chips in the satellite receiver, together referred to as
“security access devices,” to limit access to authorized programming content. When a consumer
orders a particular channel, we send a message by satellite that instructs the security access
devices to permit decryption of the programming for viewing by that
consumer. The receiver then
decompresses the programming and sends it to the consumer’s television. We own 50% of NagraStar
L.L.C., a joint venture that provides us with security access devices. Nagra USA, a subsidiary of
the Kudelski Group, owns the other 50% of NagraStar. NagraStar purchases these security access
devices from NagraCard SA, a Swiss company which is also a subsidiary of the Kudelski Group. These
security access devices, certain aspects of which we can upgrade over the air or replace
periodically, are a key element in preserving the security of our conditional access system.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and
could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our
encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more
difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card
replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other
security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our
security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are
required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million.



Installation

.

While some consumers have the skills necessary to install our equipment in their
homes, we believe that most installations are best performed by professionals, and that on time,
quality installations are important to our success. Consequently, we are continuing to expand our
installation business. We use both employees and independent contractors for professional
installations. Independent installers are held to our service standards to attempt to ensure each
DISH Network customer receives the same quality installation and service. Our offices and
independent installers are strategically located throughout the continental United States.
Although there can be no assurance, we believe that our internal installation business helps to
improve quality control, decrease wait time on service calls and new installations and helps us
better accommodate anticipated subscriber growth.

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers

.

Our principal digital broadcast operations centers are
located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona. We also have five regional digital broadcast
operations centers that allow us to utilize the spot beam capabilities of our satellites.
Programming and other data is received at these centers by fiber or satellite, processed, and then
uplinked to our owned and leased satellites for transmission to consumers. Equipment at our
digital broadcast operations centers performs substantially all compression and encryption of DISH
Network’s programming signals.

Customer Service Centers

.

We currently operate ten owned and several out-sourced customer service
centers fielding most of our customer service calls. Potential and existing subscribers can call a
single telephone number to receive assistance for sales, hardware, programming, billing,
installation and technical support. We continue to work to automate simple phone responses and to
increase Internet-based customer assistance in order to better manage customer service costs and
improve the customer’s self-service experience.

Subscriber Management

.

We presently use, and are dependent on, CSG Systems International, Inc.’s
software system for the majority of DISH Network subscriber billing and related functions.

ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

EchoStar Technologies Corporation (“ETC”), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, designs and
develops EchoStar receiver systems. Our satellite receivers have won numerous awards from the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, retailers and industry trade publications. We
out-source the manufacture of EchoStar receiver systems to third parties who manufacture the
receivers in accordance with our specifications.

The primary purpose of our ETC division is to support the DISH Network. However, ETC also sells
similar digital satellite receivers internationally, either directly to television service
operators or to our independent distributors worldwide. This has created a source of additional
business for us and synergies that directly benefit DISH Network. For example, our satellite
receivers are designed around the Digital Video Broadcasting standard, which is widely used in
Europe and Asia. The same employees who design EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network are
also involved in designing receivers sold to international customers. Consequently, we benefit
from the possibility that ETC’s international projects may result in improvements in design and
economies of scale in the production of EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network. We believe
that direct-to-home (“DTH”) satellite service is particularly well-suited for countries without
extensive cable infrastructure, and we are actively soliciting new business for ETC. However,
there can be no assurance that ETC will be able to develop additional international sales or
maintain its existing business.

Through 2006, our primary international customer was Bell ExpressVu, a subsidiary of Bell Canada,
Canada’s national telephone company. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from
Bell ExpressVu and others through mid-year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006.
In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with
Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell
ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future.

We are actively trying to secure new orders from other potential international customers. However,
we cannot guarantee at this time that those negotiations will be successful. Our future
international revenue depends largely on the success of these and other international operators,
which in turn, depends on other factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of DTH satellite
TV products and the increasing intensity of competition for international subscription television
subscribers.



We are also trying to use our large internal engineering design group to create new business
opportunities both domestically and abroad, including working on the delivery of video over the
Internet, mobile video delivery and other initiatives. In addition, we believe that we can utilize
our engineering expertise to enable our wholesale commercial FSS business to offer integrated
satellite capacity solutions that may not be available from other providers of wholesale commercial
satellite capacity.

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

Strategic Investments in International Projects

We have entered into agreements to construct and launch an S-band satellite and lease the
transponder capacity of that satellite to an affiliate of a Chinese
regulatory entity to support the
development of satellite-delivered mobile video services in China. We also recently completed an investment in TU
Media Corp., a Korean provider of satellite-delivered mobile video services, and we are currently
evaluating strategic development opportunities in several other international markets.

These transactions are part of our strategy to expand our business internationally and support the
development of new satellite-delivered services, such as mobile video services. The expertise we
obtain through these projects may also help us to improve and expand our U.S. business. However,
these international projects involve a high degree of risk, including, among other things, the
risks that required regulatory approvals and other conditions may not
be obtained or satisfied, that we may not be able to enter into
necessary distribution and other relationships, and that the companies in which we invest or with
whom we partner may not be able to compete effectively in these markets or that there may be
insufficient demand for the new services planned for these markets.

We may increase our strategic international investments in the future.

Acquisition of Spectrum for New Services

During February 2007, we began participating in an FCC Auction for licenses in the 1.4 GHz band.
Through February 26, 2007, we were the provisional winning bidder for licenses totaling
approximately $52.0 million and we may continue to bid on the licenses available in the Auction
through its conclusion. We are currently evaluating commercial uses for this spectrum. While its
propagation characteristics are attractive, the small amount of spectrum limits its potential
commercial use. Even if these licenses are awarded to us, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to exploit these licenses or that we could raise all capital required to develop these
licenses.

Development of Fixed Satellite Services Business

We continue to focus on improving our competitive position and growing our business by leveraging
our satellite and engineering capacity to pursue complementary strategic initiatives. These
initiatives include expanding into provision of wholesale commercial fixed satellite services to
provide customers with end-to-end solutions and a reliable platform to distribute video and data
throughout the United States and internationally.



OUR SATELLITES

Our DISH Network satellite television programming is currently transmitted to our customers over
satellites that operate in the “Ku” band portion of the microwave radio spectrum. The Ku-band is
divided into two spectrum segments. The high power portion of the Ku-band — 12.2 to 12.7 GHz —
is known as the Broadcast Satellite Service (“BSS”) band, which is also referred to as the Direct
Broadcast Satellite (“DBS”) band. The low and medium power portion of the Ku-band — 11.7 to 12.2
GHz — is known as the Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) band.

Most of our DTH programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites. We continue to explore
opportunities to expand our available DTH and wholesale commercial satellite capacity through the
use of other available spectrum. Increasing our available spectrum for DTH applications is
particularly important as more bandwidth intensive HD programming is produced and in order to
address new video and data applications consumers may desire in the future. Although we have
provided DTH services on a limited basis using FSS spectrum, due to the larger dish size generally
required and other technical limitations, this spectrum is best suited for commercial and wholesale
business applications.

We also continue to explore the use of Ka-band spectrum for DTH use. The Ka-band is a higher
frequency band than the Ku-band, ranging from 18 to 40 GHz. However, a larger dish is generally
required and interference caused by rain and snow is a more significant problem than is the case
with DBS spectrum.

Satellite Fleet

We presently transmit programming from 14 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300
miles above the equator. Of these 11 are owned and three are leased. Our satellite fleet is a
major component of our EchoStar DBS System. While we believe that overall our satellite fleet is
generally in good condition, during 2006 and prior periods, certain satellites in our fleet have
experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their commercial
operation. We currently do not carry insurance for any of our owned in-orbit satellites. We
believe we generally have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short
time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in-orbit
satellites were to fail. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and
other niche programming in the event of such a failure, with the extent of disruption dependent on
the specific satellite experiencing the failure. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured
in the event of multiple satellite losses.

Owned Satellites

We currently own 11 in-orbit satellites.

EchoStar I

. EchoStar I was launched during December 1995 and currently operates at the 148 degree
orbital location. The satellite can operate up to 16 transponders at 130 watts per channel.
During the second quarter of 2006, the satellite experienced anomalies resulting in the possible
loss of two solar array strings. An investigation of the anomalies is continuing. The anomalies
have not impacted commercial operation of the satellite to date. Even if permanent loss of the two
solar array strings is confirmed, the original minimum 12-year design life of the satellite is not
expected to be impacted since the satellite is equipped with a total of 104 solar array strings,
only approximately 98 of which are required to assure full power availability for the design life
of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact the remaining life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar II

. EchoStar II was launched during September 1996 and currently operates at the 148
degree orbital location. The satellite can operate up to 16 transponders at 130 watts per channel.
During February 2007, the satellite experienced an anomaly which prevented its north solar array
from rotating. Functionality was restored through a backup system. The design life of the
satellite has not been affected and the anomaly is not expected to result in the loss of power to
the satellite. However, if the backup system fails, a partial loss of power would result which
could impact the useful life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar III

. EchoStar III was launched during October 1997 and currently operates at the 61.5
degree orbital location. The satellite was originally designed to operate a maximum of 32
transponders at approximately 120 watts



per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per channel, and was
equipped with a total of 44 transponders to provide redundancy. Prior to 2006, TWTA anomalies
caused 22 transponders to fail. During April and October 2006, further TWTA anomalies caused the
failure of four additional transponders. As a result, a maximum of 18 transponders are currently
available for use on EchoStar III, but due to redundancy switching limitations and specific channel
authorizations, we can only operate 15 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies we have the right to
utilize at the 61.5 degree location. While we do not expect a large number of additional TWTAs to
fail in any year, and the failures have not reduced the original
minimum 12-year design life of the
satellite, it is likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from time to time in the future,
and those failures will further impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar IV

. EchoStar IV was launched during May 1998 and currently operates at the 77 degree
orbital location, which is licensed by the government of Mexico to a venture in which we hold a minority interest. The satellite was originally
designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per channel. As a result of past TWTA failures,
only six transponders are currently available for use and the satellite has been fully depreciated
on our books. There can be no assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use,
of EchoStar IV will not occur in the immediate future.

EchoStar V

. EchoStar V was launched during September 1999 and currently operates at the 129 degree
orbital location. The satellite was originally designed with a minimum 12-year design life. As
previously disclosed, momentum wheel failures in prior years, together with relocation of the
satellite between orbital locations, resulted in increased fuel consumption. These issues have not
impacted commercial operation of the satellite, but have reduced the remaining spacecraft life to
less than two years as of December 31, 2006. Prior to 2006, EchoStar V also experienced anomalies
resulting in the loss of six solar array strings. During July 2006, the satellite lost an
additional solar array string. The solar array anomalies have not impacted commercial operation of
the satellite to date. Since the satellite only has a remaining life of approximately two years,
the solar array failures (which would normally have resulted in a reduction in the number of
transponders to which power can be provided in later years), are not expected to reduce the current
remaining life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not
cause further losses which could impact commercial operation, or the remaining life, of the
satellite. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived Satellite Assets

” in Note 4
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

EchoStar VI

. EchoStar VI was launched during July 2000 and is currently stationed at the 110
degree orbital location as an in-orbit spare. The satellite was originally equipped with 108 solar
array strings, approximately 102 of which are required to assure full power availability for the
original minimum 12-year design life of the satellite. Prior to 2006, EchoStar VI experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of 15 solar array strings. During 2006, two additional solar array
strings failed, reducing the number of functional solar array strings to 91. While the design life
of the satellite has not been affected, commercial operability has been reduced. The satellite was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 225 watts per channel. The power reduction resulting from
the solar array failures limits us to operation of a maximum of 26 transponders in standard power
mode, or 13 transponders in high power mode currently. The number of transponders to which power
can be provided is expected to continue to decline in the future at the rate of approximately one
transponder every three years. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived Satellite
Assets

” in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

EchoStar VII

. EchoStar VII was launched during February 2002 and currently operates at the 119
degree orbital location. During March 2006, the satellite experienced an anomaly which resulted in
the loss of a receiver. Service was quickly restored through a spare receiver. These receivers
process signals sent from our uplink center, for transmission back to earth by the satellite. The
design life of the satellite has not been affected and the anomaly is not expected to result in the
loss of other receivers on the satellite. However, there can be no assurance future anomalies will
not cause further receiver losses which could impact the useful life or commercial operation of the
satellite. In the event the spare receiver placed in operation following the March 2006 anomaly
also fails, there would be no impact to the satellite’s ability to provide service to the
continental United States (“CONUS”) when operating in CONUS mode. However, we would lose one-fifth
of the spot beam capacity when operating in spot beam mode.



EchoStar VIII

. EchoStar VIII was launched during August 2002 and currently operates at the 110
degree orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately
120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per
channel. EchoStar VIII also includes spot-beam technology. As previously disclosed, the satellite
has experienced several anomalies since launch, but none have reduced the 12-year estimated useful
life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not cause
further losses which could materially impact its commercial operation, or result in a total loss of
the satellite.

We depend on EchoStar VIII to provide service to CONUS at least until such time as our EchoStar XI
satellite has commenced commercial operation, which is currently expected during the second half of
2008. AMC-14, which is expected to commence commercial operation in early 2008, also has the
capability to act as a backup for EchoStar VIII and could be launched to the 110 degree orbital
location, if necessary. In the event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial
failure, we could transmit many, but not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

EchoStar IX

. EchoStar IX was launched during August 2003 and currently operates at the 121 degree
orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 32 FSS
transponders operating at approximately 110
watts per channel, along with transponders that can provide services in the Ka-Band (a “Ka-band
payload”). EchoStar IX provides expanded video and audio channels to DISH Network subscribers who
install a specially-designed dish. The Ka-band spectrum is being used to test and verify potential
future broadband initiatives and to implement those services. The satellite also includes a C-band
payload which is owned by a third party. During the fourth quarter of 2006, EchoStar IX
experienced the loss of one of its three momentum wheels, two of which are utilized during normal
operations. A spare wheel was switched in at the time and the loss did not reduce the 12-year
estimated useful life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance future anomalies will
not cause further losses, which could impact the remaining life or commercial operation of the
satellite.

EchoStar X

. EchoStar X was launched during February 2006 and currently operates at the 110 degree
orbital location. Its 49 spot beams use up to 42 active 140 watt TWTAs to provide standard and HD
local channels, and other programming, to markets across the United States. In the event our
EchoStar X satellite experienced a significant failure, we would lose the ability to deliver local
network channels in many markets. While we would attempt to minimize the number of lost markets
through the use of spare satellites and programming line up changes, some markets would be without
local channels until a replacement satellite with similar spot beam capability could be launched
and operational.

EchoStar XII

. EchoStar XII was launched during July 2003 and currently operates at the 61.5 degree
orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 13 transponders at 270 watts per channel,
in CONUS mode, or 22 spot beams using a combination of 135 and 65 watt TWTAs. We currently operate
the satellite in CONUS mode. EchoStar XII has a total of 24 solar array circuits, approximately 22
of which are required to assure full power for the original minimum 12-year design life of the
satellite. Prior to 2006, two solar array circuits failed, one of which was subsequently restored
to partial use. During 2006, three additional solar array circuits failed. The cause of the
failures is being investigated. While the design life of the satellite has not been affected, in
future years the power loss will cause a reduction in the number of transponders which can be
operated. The exact extent of this impact has not yet been determined. There can be no assurance
future anomalies will not cause further losses, which could further impact commercial operation of
the satellite or its useful life. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived
Satellite Assets

” in Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Leased Satellites

We currently lease three in-orbit satellites which are being used to provide, among other things,
standard and HD programming to certain local markets, international programming, backup capacity
and fixed satellite service capacity on a wholesale commercial basis (rather than direct to
consumers).

AMC-2

. AMC-2 currently operates at the 85 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS
satellite is equipped with 24 medium power Ku FSS transponders. Our lease of this satellite is
expected to continue through 2007.



AMC-15

. AMC-15 commenced commercial operation during January 2005 and currently operates at the
105 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS satellite is equipped with 24 Ku FSS
transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per channel and a Ka FSS payload consisting of
12 spot beams. The ten-year satellite service agreement for this satellite is renewable by us on a
year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement
satellites.

AMC-16

. AMC-16 commenced commercial operation during February 2005 and currently operates at the
118.7 degree orbital location. This SES Americom FSS satellite is equipped with 24 Ku FSS
transponders that operate at approximately 120 watts per channel and a Ka FSS payload consisting of
12 spot beams. The ten-year satellite service agreement for this satellite is renewable by us on a
year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement
satellites.

Satellites under Construction

We have entered into contracts to construct a number of additional satellites, including the
following satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years.

•

EchoStar XI, a Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (“SSL”) DBS satellite, is expected to be
completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a
result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch.
EchoStar XI is expected to provide service to CONUS from the 110 degree orbital location.
This satellite will enable better bandwidth utilization, provide back-up protection for our
existing offerings, and could allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

•

Four additional SSL Ka and/or Ku extended band satellites are contractually scheduled to
be completed during 2008 and 2009. They would enable better bandwidth utilization and
could allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

•

CMBStar, an S-band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of
2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity to support the development of satellite-delivered mobile video services in China.

•

During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV, an
SSL DBS satellite, which is expected to be completed during 2009. This satellite has been designed with a combination of CONUS and spot beam capacity and could be used at multiple orbital locations. EchoStar XIV could
also allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

We have also entered into agreements to lease capacity on the following satellites currently under
construction.

•

An SES Americom DBS satellite (“AMC-14”) which is currently expected to launch during
late 2007, and commence commercial operation in early 2008 at an orbital location to be
determined at a future date. The satellite is being equipped with transmit antennas
optimized for multiple orbital locations, providing greater backup flexibility in the event
certain other in-orbit satellites fail.

•

A Telesat FSS satellite (“Anik F3”) which is currently scheduled to be launched during
second quarter of 2007 and commence commercial operation at the 118.7 degree orbital
location. This satellite could allow DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

•

A Canadian DBS satellite (“Ciel 2”) which is currently scheduled to be launched during
2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location, has both spot
and CONUS capabilities. This satellite could be used to provide HD programming to CONUS
and as additional backup capacity.

We are significantly increasing our satellite capacity as a result of the agreements discussed
above and other satellite service agreements currently under negotiation. While we are currently
evaluating various opportunities to make profitable use of this capacity (including, but not
limited to, increasing our international programming and other services, expanding our local and HD programming, offering fixed satellite
service capacity on a wholesale commercial basis (rather than direct to consumers), and supplying satellite capacity for new international ventures, we do not have firm plans to utilize all of the additional
satellite



capacity we expect to acquire. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can successfully
develop the business opportunities we currently plan to pursue with this additional capacity.
Future costs associated with this additional capacity will negatively impact our margins if we do
not have sufficient growth in subscribers or in demand for new programming or services to generate
revenue to offset the costs of this increased capacity.

Competition for our Dish Network Business

We compete in the subscription television service industry against other DBS television providers,
cable television and other system operators offering video, audio and data programming and
entertainment services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing
and other resources than we have. Our earnings and other operating metrics could be materially and
adversely affected if we are unable to compete successfully with these and other new providers of
multi-channel video programming services.

Cable Television

.

Cable television operators have a large, established customer base, and many
cable operators have significant investments in programming. Cable television operators continue
to leverage their incumbency advantages relative to satellite operators by, among other things,
bundling their video service with 2-way high speed Internet access and telephone services. Cable
television operators with analog systems are also able to provide service to multiple television
sets within the same household at a lesser incremental cost to the consumer, and they are able to
provide local and other programming in a larger number of geographic areas. As a result of these
and other factors, we may not be able to continue to expand our subscriber base or compete
effectively against cable television operators.

Some digital cable platforms currently offer a video on demand (“VOD”) service that enables
subscribers to choose from a library of programming selections for viewing at their convenience.
We are continuing to develop our own VOD service experience through automatic video downloads to
hard drives in certain of our satellite receivers, the inclusion of broadband connectivity
components in certain of our satellite receivers, and other technologies. There can be no
assurance that our VOD service will successfully compare with offerings from other video providers.

DBS and Other Direct-to-Home System Operators

.

News Corporation owns a 38.5% controlling interest
in the DirecTV Group, Inc. (“DirecTV”). In December 2006, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”)
agreed to exchange its 16.3% stake in News Corporation for News Corporation’s stake in DirecTV,
together with regional sports networks in Denver, Pittsburg and Seattle. The deal is expected to
be completed during the second half of 2007. News Corporation and Liberty each have ownership
interests in diverse world-wide programming content and other related businesses. These assets
provide competitive advantages to DirecTV with respect to the acquisition of programming, content
and other business opportunities valuable to our industry.

In addition, DirecTV’s satellite receivers are sold in a significantly greater number of consumer
electronics stores than ours. As a result of this and other factors, our services are less well
known to consumers than those of DirecTV. Due to this relative lack of consumer awareness and
other factors, we are at a competitive marketing disadvantage compared to DirecTV. DirecTV also
offers exclusive programming, and may have access to discounts on programming, not available to us.
DirecTV plans to launch two new satellites in 2007 in order to offer local and national channel
programming in HD to most of the U.S. population. Although we have launched our own HD
initiatives, if DirecTV fully implements these plans, they may have an additional competitive
advantage.

New entrants in the subscription satellite services business would have a competitive advantage
over us in deploying some new products and technologies because of the substantial costs we may be
required to incur to make new products or technologies available across our installed base of over
13 million subscribers.

VHF/UHF Broadcasters

.

Most areas of the United States can receive between three and 10 free over
the air broadcast channels, including local content most consumers consider important. The FCC has
allocated additional digital spectrum to these broadcasters, which can be used to transmit multiple
additional programming channels. Our business could be adversely affected by increased program
offerings by traditional broadcasters.

New Technologies and Competitors

. New technologies could also have an adverse effect on the demand
for our DBS services. For example, we face an increasingly significant competitive threat from the
build-out of advanced fiber optic networks. Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and AT&T have
begun deployment of fiber-optic



networks that will allow them to offer video services bundled with traditional phone and high speed
Internet directly to millions of homes. In addition, telephone companies and other entities are
implementing and supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines which may allow
them to offer video services without having to build a new infrastructure. We also expect to face
increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to
consumers over the Internet.

With the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of
video content has become available on the Internet for users to download and view on their personal
computers and other devices. In addition, there are several initiatives by companies to make it
easier to view Internet-based video on television and personal computer screens. We also could
face competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to
consumers via digital air waves.

Mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable television
operators, telephone companies and others also may result in providers capable of offering
television services in competition with us.

Impact of High Definition TV

. Although we believe we currently offer consumers a compelling amount
of HD programming content, other multi-channel video providers may be better equipped to increase
their HD offerings to respond to increasing consumer demand for this content. For example, cable
companies are able to offer local network channels in HD in more markets than we can, and DirecTV
has announced that it will soon be able to offer over 150 channels of HD programming by satellite.
We could be further disadvantaged to the extent a significant number of local broadcasters begin
offering local channels in HD. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in
infrastructure to respond to competitive pressure to deliver additional HD programming, and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with HD program offerings from
other video providers.

Competition for Our ETC Business

Through ETC, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, many of which
have significantly greater resources, financial or otherwise, than we have. We expect new
competitors to enter this market because of rapidly changing technology. Our ability to anticipate
these technological changes and introduce enhanced products expeditiously will be a significant
factor in our ability to remain competitive. We do not know if we will be able to successfully
introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis in order to remain competitive.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FCC. We are also regulated by other federal
agencies, state and local authorities and the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”).
Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by
these entities could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the
termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal
penalties.

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is not intended to describe all
present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting the video programming
distribution industry. Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or
administrative proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change our
industry to varying degrees. We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or any
potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations.

FCC Regulation under the Communications Act

FCC Jurisdiction over our Operations.

The Communications Act gives the FCC broad authority to
regulate the operations of satellite companies. Specifically, the Communications Act gives the FCC
regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relating to communications satellite operations:

•

the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations;

•

licensing of satellites, earth stations, the granting of related authorizations, and
evaluation of the fitness of a company to be a licensee;

•

approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations or the
replacement of an existing satellite with a new satellite;

•

ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of such assignments and
authorizations, including required timetables for construction and operation of
satellites and other due diligence requirements;



•

avoiding interference with other radio frequency emitters; and

•

ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and
FCC rules and regulations governing the operations of satellite communications
providers and multi-channel video distributors.

In order to obtain FCC satellite licenses and authorizations, satellite operators must satisfy
strict legal, technical and financial qualification requirements. Once issued, these licenses and
authorizations are subject to a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of
ongoing due diligence obligations, construction milestones, and various reporting requirements.

Overview of Our Satellites and FCC Authorizations

.

Our satellites are located in orbital
positions, or slots, that are designated by their western longitude. An orbital position describes
both a physical location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band. The FCC
has divided each DBS orbital position into 32 frequency channels. Each transponder on our
satellites typically exploits one frequency channel. Through digital compression technology, we
can currently transmit between nine and 13 standard definition digital video channels from each
transponder. Several of our satellites also include spot-beam technology which enables us to
increase the number of markets where we provide local channels, but reduces the number of video
channels that could otherwise be offered across the entire United States.

The FCC has licensed us to operate a total of 104 direct broadcast satellite frequencies at the
following orbital locations:

•

21 frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location and 29 frequencies at the 110
degree orbital location, both capable of providing service to the entire
continental United States (“CONUS”);

•

22 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location, capable of providing service
to the Eastern and Central United States; and

•

32 frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location, capable of providing service
to the Western United States.

In addition, we currently have the right to use 32 frequencies at a Canadian DBS slot at the 129
degree orbital location, capable of providing service to most of CONUS. A new 32 transponder
Canadian satellite, Ciel 2, is being constructed for operation at that location. We will have the
right to lease at least 50% of the capacity of that satellite, with the remaining 50% required by
Canadian regulations to be offered for use by Canadians until the time of launch of the satellite.
Consequently, until Ciel 2 is launched, we will not know the exact amount of capacity available to
us on that satellite. Further, we currently have the right to use 32 frequencies at a Mexican DBS
orbital slot at the 77 degree orbital location, but it is likely to be several years before a
satellite is available to exploit all of that spectrum.

We also hold licenses or have entered into agreements to lease capacity on satellites at the
following FSS orbital locations including:

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 32 frequencies at the 121 degree orbital
location, capable of providing service to CONUS, plus 500 MHz of Ka spectrum at the
121 degree orbital location capable of providing service into select spot beams;

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum currently divided into 24 frequencies at the 118.7 degree
orbital location, capable of providing service to CONUS, Alaska and
Hawaii;

•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 24 frequencies at the 105 degree orbital
location, currently capable of providing service to CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii, plus
approximately 720 MHz of Ka spectrum capable of providing service through spot
beams to CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii; and



•

500 MHz of Ku spectrum divided into 24 frequencies at the 85 degree orbital
location, currently capable of providing service to CONUS, plus approximately 720
MHz of Ka spectrum capable of providing service through spot beams to CONUS.

We currently broadcast the majority of our programming from the 110 and 119 degree orbital
locations. Almost all of our customers have satellite receiver systems that are equipped to
receive signals from both of these locations.

We also sublease six transponders (corresponding to six frequencies) at the 61.5 degree orbital
location from licensee Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. (“Dominion”). We are currently operating on
the two remaining unassigned frequencies at that location under a conditional special temporary
authorization. We recently renewed that STA for 60 days. While
there can be no assurance, we believe the FCC will continue to renew
this STA periodically for the foreseeable future.

Duration of our DBS Satellite Licenses

. Generally speaking, all of our satellite licenses are
subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC. The term of each of our DBS licenses is 10 years.
Two of our licenses were due to expire in November 2006 and we have timely requested their
renewal. Our other licenses are currently set to expire at various times. In addition, our
special temporary authorizations are granted for periods of only 180 days or less, subject again to
possible renewal by the FCC.

Opposition and other Risks to our Licenses

. Several third parties have opposed, and we expect them
to continue to oppose, some of our FCC satellite authorizations and pending requests to the FCC for
extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses. In addition, we may not have
fully complied with all of the FCC reporting and filing requirements in connection with our
satellite authorizations. Consequently, it is possible the FCC could revoke, terminate, condition
or decline to extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses.

Our FSS Licenses

. In addition to our DBS licenses and authorizations, we have received conditional
licenses from the FCC to operate FSS satellites in the Ka-band, the Ku-band and the extended
Ku-band, including licenses to operate EchoStar IX (a hybrid Ka/Ku-band satellite) at the 121
degree orbital location. In addition, EchoStar holds Ka-band licenses at the 97 and 113 degree
orbital locations, an extended Ku-band license at the 109 degree orbital location and a hybrid
extended Ku/Ka-band license at the 121 degree orbital location. Use of these licenses and
conditional authorizations is subject to certain technical and due diligence requirements,
including the requirement to construct and launch satellites according to specific milestones and
deadlines. Our projects to construct and launch Ku-band, extended Ku-band and Ka-band satellites
are in various stages of development.

Risks to our FSS Authorizations

. With respect to our Ka-band licenses at the 97 and 113 degrees
orbital locations, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation of the satellites to be
completed by December 2008 and October 2009, respectively. Moreover, ITU deadlines require Ka-band
satellites to be operating at the 97 and 113 degree orbital locations by June and May of 2007,
respectively. For our extended Ku-band license at the 109 degree orbital location and our hybrid
extended Ku/Ka-band license at the 121 degree orbital location, the FCC requires construction,
launch and operation of the satellites to be completed by September 2009. We are also subject to
intermediate construction milestones. There can be no assurance that we will develop acceptable
plans to meet all of these deadlines, or that we will be able to utilize any of these orbital
slots.

FCC Rulemaking Affecting our Licenses and Applications

. A number of our other applications have
been denied or dismissed without prejudice by the FCC, or remain pending. We cannot be sure that
the FCC will grant any of our outstanding applications, or that the authorizations, if granted,
will not be subject to onerous conditions. Moreover, the cost of building, launching and insuring
a satellite can be as much as $250.0 million or more, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to
construct and launch all of the satellites for which we have requested authorizations. The FCC has
also imposed a $3.0 million bond requirement for our FSS satellite licenses, all or part of which
would be forfeited by a licensee that does not meet its diligence milestones for a particular
satellite. We have provided the FCC with letters of credit, collateralized by $15.2 million of our
restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of December 31, 2006, to satisfy these
requirements for our Ka-band and extended Ku-band licenses.

Satellite License Proceedings

. In 2004, the FCC ruled that businesses holding DBS licenses at
orbital locations capable of serving the entire continental United States (including EchoStar)
would not be eligible to bid for the



license for the two frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location, and would not be qualified to
acquire that license for a period of four years following grant. We filed a request for
reconsideration of this ruling, which Dominion opposed and we cannot be certain of a positive
outcome. In addition, the FCC has placed a moratorium on new DBS applications.

Expansion DBS Spectrum

. The FCC has also allocated additional expansion spectrum for DBS services
commencing in 2007, and has started a proceeding on licensing rules. This could create significant
additional competition in the market for subscription television services. We have filed
applications to use this additional spectrum at a number of slots, but cannot predict whether the
FCC will grant these applications.

4.5
Degree Spacing

. The FCC has proposed to allow so-called
“tweener” DBS operations, which refers to DBS
satellites operating from orbital locations 4.5 degrees (half of the usual 9 degrees) away from
other DBS satellites. The FCC has already granted authorizations to Spectrum Five and us for
tweener satellites at the 114.5 and 86.5 degree orbital locations, respectively. We have
challenged the Spectrum Five authorization, and Telesat Canada, a Canadian satellite operator, has
challenged our license. Certain tweener operations could cause harmful interference into our
service and constrain our future operations.

Other Services in the DBS Band

. The FCC has adopted rules that allow non-geostationary orbit fixed
satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency band as direct broadcast
satellite and Ku-band-based fixed satellite services. In the same rulemaking, the FCC authorized
use of the DBS spectrum that we use by terrestrial communication
services, and it auctioned
licenses for these terrestrial services during January 2004. There can be no assurance that
operations by terrestrial communication services in the DBS band will not interfere with our DBS
operations and adversely affect our business.

Competition for Foreign DBS Orbital Slots

. DirecTV has obtained FCC authority to provide service
to the United States from a Canadian DBS orbital slot. We have also received authority to do the
same from a Canadian DBS orbital slot at 129 degrees and from a Mexican orbital slot at 77 degrees.
The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the U.S. from other foreign slots may permit
additional competition against us from other DBS providers.

Rules Relating to Alaska and Hawaii

. The holders of DBS authorizations issued after January 1996
must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii if such service is technically feasible from the
authorized orbital location. Our authorizations at the 110 degree and 148 degree orbital locations
were received after January 1996. While we provide service to Alaska and Hawaii from both the 110
and 119 degree orbital locations, those states have expressed the view that our service should more
closely resemble our service to the mainland United States and otherwise needs improvement. We
received temporary conditional waivers of the service requirement for the 148 degree orbital
location. However, the FCC could revoke these waivers at any time.

The FCC has also introduced a requirement that we provide programming packages to residents of
Hawaii and Alaska that are “reasonably comparable” to what we offer in the contiguous 48 states.
In addition, the FCC has interpreted a statutory requirement so as to require us to provide HD and
multicast carriage of local broadcast signals in Alaska and Hawaii. We cannot be sure that these
requirements will not affect us adversely by requiring us to devote additional resources to serving
these two states.

A La Carte

. Some Members of Congress have proposed the imposition of indecency restrictions on
satellite and cable providers. Others, together with the Chairman of the FCC, have suggested that
satellite and cable providers be required to offer some or all programming on an individual, or “a
la carte” basis. We cannot predict the effect any such obligations would have on our business.

Emergency Alert System

.

The Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) requires participants to
interrupt programming during nationally-declared emergencies and to pass through emergency-related
information. The FCC recently released an order requiring satellite carriers to participate in the
“national” portion of EAS. It is also considering whether to mandate that satellite carriers also
interrupt programming for local emergencies and weather events. We cannot be sure that this
requirement will not affect us adversely by requiring us to devote additional resources to
complying with EAS requirements.



Other Communications Act Provisions

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services

. The FCC imposes different rules for “subscription” and
“broadcast” services. We believe that because we offer a subscription programming service, we are
not subject to many of the regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees. However, we
cannot be certain whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory
obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we be treated as a
broadcaster. If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast licensee, it could require us to comply
with all regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees, which are generally subject to
more burdensome regulation than subscription television service providers.

Public Interest Requirements

. Under a requirement of the Cable Act, the FCC imposed public
interest requirements on DBS licensees. These rules require us to set aside four percent of our
channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial programming for which we must charge programmers
below-cost rates and for which we may not impose additional charges on subscribers. This could
displace programming for which we could earn commercial rates and could adversely affect our
financial results. The FCC has generally not reviewed all aspects of our methodology for
processing public interest carriage requests, computing the channel capacity we must set aside or
determining the rates that we charge public interest programmers. We cannot be sure that if the
FCC were to review these methodologies it would find them in compliance with the public interest
requirements.

Plug and Play

. The FCC adopted the so-called “plug and play” standard for compatibility between
digital television sets and cable systems. That standard was developed through negotiations
involving the cable and consumer electronics industries, but not us, and we are concerned that it
may impose certain onerous “encoding rules” on all multi-channel video programming distributors,
including us, and that the standard and its implementation process favor cable systems. We have
filed a petition for review of the FCC’s “plug and play” order with the federal Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit on various grounds, but we cannot be sure that the court will
not uphold the FCC’s decision.

Closed Captioning

. In 2005, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding seeking comments on whether
its rules that require broadcasters, DBS providers and cable operators to transmit closed captioned
content should be revised. We currently do not have the capability of captioning every channel
that we carry and rely on the program originators to perform this task. No technology exists that
can be applied outside the program originator’s facility to determine if a program is correctly
captioned. If we are required to monitor every one of the thousands of programs that we carry to
ensure accurate captioning, we will bear substantial equipment, personnel and other related costs.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization
Act

Opposition to Delivery of Distant Signals

. On October 20, 2006, a District Court in Florida
entered a permanent nationwide injunction prohibiting us from offering distant network channels to
consumers effective December 1, 2006. Distant networks are ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox network channels
which originate outside the community where the consumer who wants to view them, lives. We have
turned off all of our distant network channels and are no longer in the distant network business.
The ruling does not impact in any way our ability to provide local channels by satellite, which we
currently offer in over 170 markets, representing over 96% of all of U.S. television households.

Retransmission of Local Networks

. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, or SHVIA, generally
gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by
satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission
consent of the local network station. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with
broadcasters we cannot carry their signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to
compete with cable and other satellite companies which provide local signals. While we have been
able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most local network stations in markets



where we currently offer local channels by satellite, roll-out of local channels in additional
cities will require that we obtain additional retransmission agreements. We cannot be sure that we
will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements upon the expiration of our
current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short term.

Dependence on Cable Act for Program Access

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. The
Cable Act’s provisions prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable affiliated
programmers are currently set to expire in October 2007. If those rules are not extended, many
popular programs may become unavailable to us, causing a loss of customers and adversely affecting
our revenues and financial performance. Any change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that
permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing
businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming could adversely affect our ability to acquire
programming at all or to acquire programming on a cost-effective basis. Further, the FCC generally
has not shown a willingness to enforce the program access rules aggressively. As a result, we may
be limited in our ability to obtain access (or nondiscriminatory access) to programming from
programmers that are affiliated with the cable system operators.

Affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to
their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. To the extent that cable operators
deliver additional programming terrestrially in the future, they may assert that this additional
programming is also exempt from the program access laws. These restrictions on our access to
programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by
these cable providers.

The International Telecommunication Union

Our DBS system also must conform to the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU, broadcasting
satellite service plan for Region 2 (which includes the United States). If any of our operations
are not consistent with this plan, the ITU will only provide authorization on a non-interference
basis pending successful modification of the plan or the agreement of all affected administrations
to the non-conforming operations. Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its broadcasting
satellite service plan to include the technical parameters of DBS applicants’ operations, our
satellites, along with those of other DBS operators, must not cause harmful electrical interference
with other assignments that are in conformance with the plan. Further, DBS satellites are not
presently entitled to any protection from other satellites that are in conformance with the plan.
The United States government has filed or is in the process of filing modification requests with
the ITU for EchoStar I through VIII, EchoStar X and EchoStar XII. The ITU has requested certain
technical information in order to process the requested modifications. We have cooperated, and
continue to cooperate, with the FCC in the preparation of its responses to the ITU requests. The
requests for modification that have been filed by the United States government are pending or in
various stages of completion. We cannot predict if all the required requests will be made or when
the ITU will act upon them.

In addition, a number of administrations, such as Great Britain and the Netherlands, have requested
modifications to the plan to add orbital locations serving the U.S. close to our licensed slots,
similar to the “tweener” operations discussed above. Such operations could cause harmful
interference into our satellites and constrain our future operations at those slots.

Export Control Regulation

We are required to obtain import and general destination export licenses from the United States
government to receive and deliver components of DTH satellite TV systems. In addition, the
delivery of satellites and related technical information for the purpose of launch by foreign
launch services providers is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that
we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products infringes on
intellectual property held by others, we may be required to



cease developing or marketing those products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the
intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid
infringing the patent claims. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we
may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our
competitive position.

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our products may potentially infringe.
In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and
Trademark Office issues a patent and, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in
pending patent applications of which we are not aware. Further, the process of determining
definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid often involves expensive and protracted
litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual
property licenses or the availability and cost of any such licenses. Those costs, and their impact
on our results of operations, could be material. Damages in patent infringement cases may also
include treble damages in certain circumstances. To the extent that we are required to pay
unanticipated royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively
affect our liquidity and operating results. We are currently defending multiple patent
infringement actions. We cannot be certain the courts will conclude these companies do not own the
rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to
obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain
such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. See “Item 3
– Legal Proceedings.”

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and
occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions,
water discharge and waste management. We attempt to maintain compliance with all such
requirements. We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be
material in 2007 or 2008. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have
become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements
will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

For operating segment and principal geographic area data for 2006, 2005 and 2004 see Note 10 in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EMPLOYEES

We had approximately 21,000 employees at December 31, 2006, most of whom are located in the
United States. We generally consider relations with our employees to be good.

Although a total of approximately 33 employees in two of our field offices have voted to unionize,
we are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements. However, we are currently
negotiating collective bargaining agreements at these offices.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may become
important factors that affect us.

If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

We compete with other subscription television service providers and traditional broadcasters, which
could affect our ability to grow and increase our earnings and other operating metrics.

We compete in the subscription television service industry against other DBS television providers,
cable television and other system operators offering video, audio and data programming and
entertainment services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing
and other resources than we have. Our earnings and other operating metrics could be materially and
adversely affected if we are unable to compete successfully with these and other new providers of
multi-channel video programming services.

Cable television operators have a large, established customer base, and many cable operators have
significant investments in programming. Cable television operators continue to leverage their
incumbency advantages relative to satellite operators by, among other things, bundling their video
service with 2-way high speed Internet access and telephone services. Cable television operators
with analog systems are also able to provide service to multiple television sets within the same
household at a lesser incremental cost to the consumer, and they are able to provide local and
other programming in a larger number of geographic areas. As a result of these and other factors,
we may not be able to continue to expand our subscriber base or compete effectively against cable
television operators.

Some digital cable platforms currently offer a VOD service that enables subscribers to choose from
a library of programming selections for viewing at their convenience. We are continuing to develop
our own VOD service experience through automatic video downloads to hard drives in certain of our
satellite receivers, the inclusion of broadband connectivity components in certain of our satellite
receivers, and other technologies. There can be no assurance that our VOD service will
successfully compare with offerings from other video providers.

News Corporation owns a 38.5% controlling interest in the DirecTV Group, Inc. (“DirecTV”). In
December 2006, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”) agreed to exchange its 16.3% stake in News
Corporation for News Corporation’s stake in DirecTV, together with regional sports networks in
Denver, Pittsburg and Seattle. The deal is expected to be completed during the second half of
2007. News Corporation and Liberty each have ownership interests in diverse world-wide
programming content and other related businesses. These assets provide competitive advantages to
DirecTV with respect to the acquisition of programming, content and other business opportunities
valuable to our industry.

In addition, DirecTV’s satellite receivers are sold in a significantly greater number of consumer
electronics stores than ours. As a result of this and other factors, our services are less well
known to consumers than those of DirecTV. Due to this relative lack of consumer awareness and
other factors, we are at a competitive marketing disadvantage compared to DirecTV. DirecTV also
offers exclusive programming, and may have access to discounts on programming, not available to us.
DirecTV plans to launch two new satellites in 2007 in order to offer local and national channel
programming in HD to most of the U.S. population. Although we have launched our own HD
initiatives, if DirecTV fully implements these plans, they may have an additional competitive
advantage.

New entrants in the subscription satellite services business would have a competitive advantage
over us in deploying some new products and technologies because of the substantial costs we may be
required to incur to make new products or technologies available across our installed base of over
13 million subscribers.



Most areas of the United States can receive between three and 10 free over the air broadcast
channels, including local content most consumers consider important. The FCC has allocated
additional digital spectrum to these broadcasters, which can be used to transmit multiple
additional programming channels. Our business could be adversely affected by increased program
offerings by traditional broadcasters.

New technologies could also have an adverse effect on the demand for our DBS services. For
example, we face an increasingly significant competitive threat from the build-out of advanced
fiber optic networks. Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and AT&T have begun deployment of
fiber-optic networks that will allow them to offer video services bundled with traditional phone
and high speed Internet directly to millions of homes. In addition, telephone companies and other
entities are implementing and supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines
which may allow them to offer video services without having to build a new infrastructure. We also
expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video
services directly to consumers over the Internet.

With the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of
video content has become available on the Internet for users to download and view on their personal
computers and other devices. In addition, there are several initiatives by companies to make it
easier to view Internet-based video on television and personal computer screens. We also could
face competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to
consumers via digital air waves.

Mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable television
operators, telephone companies and others also may result in providers capable of offering
television services in competition with us.

Although we believe we currently offer consumers a compelling amount of HD programming content,
other multi-channel video providers may be better equipped to increase their HD offerings to
respond to increasing consumer demand for this content. For example, cable companies are able to
offer local network channels in HD in more markets than we can, and DirecTV has announced that it
will soon be able to offer over 150 channels of HD programming by satellite. We could be further
disadvantaged to the extent a significant number of local broadcasters begin offering local
channels in HD. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in infrastructure to
respond to competitive pressure to deliver additional HD programming, and there can be no assurance
that we will be able to effectively compete with HD program offerings from other video providers.

Increased subscriber turnover could harm our financial performance.

Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not
limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and
new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new
advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2-way high speed Internet access and
telephone services may also contribute more significantly to churn
over time. There can be no assurance that these and
other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically.
Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to
become subscribers and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these
subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect.

Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains
constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to
sustain net subscriber growth.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. There can be no assurance that our existing security measures will not
be compromised or that any future security measures we may implement will be effective in reducing
theft of our programming signals.

Increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs could adversely affect our financial
performance.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the
cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our costs to
acquire subscribers, and to a lesser extent our subscriber retention costs, can vary significantly
from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and free cash
flow.



In addition to new subscriber acquisition costs, we incur costs to retain existing subscribers. In
an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for
upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar
receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. We also upgrade or replace subscriber
equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention and our capital
expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers will increase, at
least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements.
Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future
to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if
we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive
promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other
reasons.

Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be
satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from
operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the
future to meet these requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

In addition, any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Satellite programming signals have been subject to theft, which could cause us to lose subscribers
and revenue.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called
“smart cards,” or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to
authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and
could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our
encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more
difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card
replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other
security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our
security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are
required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million.

Our local programming strategy faces uncertainty.

SHVIA generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local
broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to
obtaining the retransmission consent of the local network station. If we fail to reach
retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters we cannot carry their signals. This could have
an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies which provide
local signals. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most local
network stations in markets where we currently offer local channels by satellite, roll-out of local
channels in additional cities will require that we obtain additional retransmission
agreements. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new
agreements upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are
short term.

We depend on the Cable Act for access to others’ programming.

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. The
Cable Act’s provisions prohibiting exclusive contracting practices with cable affiliated
programmers are currently set to expire in October 2007. If those rules are not extended, many
popular programs may become unavailable to us, causing a loss of customers and adversely affecting
our revenues and financial performance. Any change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that
permit the cable industry or cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing
businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming could adversely affect our ability to acquire
programming at all or to acquire programming on a cost-effective basis. Further, the FCC generally
has not shown a willingness to enforce the program access rules aggressively. As a result, we may
be limited in our ability to obtain access (or nondiscriminatory access) to programming from
programmers that are affiliated with the cable system operators.



Affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to
their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. To the extent that cable operators
deliver additional programming terrestrially in the future, they may assert that this additional
programming is also exempt from the program access laws. These restrictions on our access to
programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by
these cable providers.

We depend on others to produce programming.

We depend on third parties to provide us with programming services. Our programming agreements
have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to ten years and contain various renewal and
cancellation provisions. We may not be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at
all, and these agreements may be canceled prior to expiration of their original term. If we are
unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties cancel the agreements, we cannot
assure you that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute
programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In addition,
programming costs may continue to increase. We may be unable to pass programming costs on to our
customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming.

We face increasing competition from other distributors of foreign language programming, including
programming distributed over the Internet. There can be no assurance that we will continue to
experience growth in subscribers to our foreign-language programming services. In addition, the
increasing availability of foreign language programming from our competitors, which in certain
cases has resulted from our inability to renew programming agreements on an exclusive basis or at
all, could contribute to an increase in our subscriber churn. Our agreements with distributors of
foreign language programming have varying expiration dates, and some agreements are on a
month-to-month basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on
acceptable terms or at all.

We may not be aware of certain foreign government regulations.

Because regulatory schemes vary by country, we may be subject to regulations in foreign countries
of which we are not presently aware. If that were to be the case, we could be subject to sanctions
by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate in that
country. We cannot assure you that any current regulatory approvals held by us are, or will
remain, sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities, or that any additional necessary
approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to
operate new satellites, or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly
burdensome. The failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate satellites
internationally could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our
overall competitive position.

We, our customers and companies with which we do business may be required to have authority from
each country in which we or they provide services or provide our customers use of our satellites.
Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of our customers
and/or companies with which we do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.

We are subject to significant regulatory oversight and changes in applicable regulatory
requirements could adversely affect our business.

DBS operators are subject to significant government regulation, primarily by the FCC and, to a
certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and international, state and local authorities.
Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by
these entities could result in the suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations, the
termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal
penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. You should review the regulatory disclosures under the caption “

Item 1.
Business — Government Regulation — FCC Regulation under the Communication Act, Other
Communications Act Provisions”

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



During April 2006, a Texas jury concluded that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs,
infringed a patent held by Tivo. If the verdict is upheld on appeal and we are not able to
successfully implement alternative technology, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs, or be
required to modify or eliminate certain user-friendly DVR features that we currently offer to
consumers.

If the
Tivo jury verdict is upheld on appeal, we could be required to pay substantial damages, and
if we were not able to successfully implement alternative technology (including the successful
defense of any challenge that such technology infringes Tivo’s patent), we could also be prohibited
from distributing DVRs, or be required to modify or eliminate certain user-friendly DVR features
that we currently offer to consumers. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to
our competitors who could offer this functionality and, while we would attempt to provide that
functionality through other manufacturers, the adverse affect on our business could be material.

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own.

We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures
because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite
failure. We believe we generally have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a
relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of
our in-orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international
and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of
multiple satellite losses.

We currently do not have adequate backup satellite capacity to recover all of the local network
channels broadcast from our EchoStar X satellite following a complete failure of that satellite.
Therefore, our ability to deliver local channels in many markets, as well as our ability to comply
with SHVERA requirements without incurring significant additional costs, is dependent on, among
other things, the continued successful commercial operation of EchoStar X.

We also depend on EchoStar VIII to provide service to CONUS at least until such time as our
EchoStar XI satellite has commenced commercial operation, which is currently expected during the second half
of 2008. AMC-14, which is expected to commence commercial operation in early 2008, also has the
capability to act as a backup for EchoStar VIII and could be launched to the 110 degree orbital
location, if necessary. In the event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial
failure, we could transmit many, but not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

Our satellites are subject to risks related to launch.

Satellite launches are subject to significant risks, including launch failure, incorrect orbital
placement or improper commercial operation. Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have
either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the past. The risks of launch
delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of
previous successful flights. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of
satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than
two years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Such significant delays could materially and
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. If we were unable to obtain launch insurance,
or obtain launch insurance at rates we deem commercially reasonable, and a significant launch
failure were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues
and fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.

In addition, the occurrence of future launch failures may materially and adversely affect our
ability to insure the launch of our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all.
Please see further discussion under the caption “

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage
on our satellites

” above.

Our satellites are subject to significant operational risks.

Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include
malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the
satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturers’
errors, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures
resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.



Although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of
anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the
satellites, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or
arising from the failure of other systems or components.

Any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations and
revenues and our relationship with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new
customers for our direct broadcast satellites and other satellite services. In particular, future
anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders
on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly. Anomalies may
also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the revenue that could be
generated by that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement
or back-up satellites. Finally, the occurrence of anomalies may materially and adversely affect
our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. You should
review the disclosures relating to satellite anomalies set forth under Note 4 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. The probability that
meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth passes through the
particulate stream left behind by comets. Occasionally, increased solar activity also poses a
potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.

Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass through the geostationary belt
at various points, and present hazards to operational spacecraft, including our satellites. We may
be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or
could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these
maneuvers. The loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an
electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our satellites have minimum design lives of 12 years, but could fail or suffer reduced capacity
before then.

Our ability to earn revenue depends on the usefulness of our satellites. Each satellite has a
limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including,
among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the
ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite’s functions, the
efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion.
Generally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites is 12 years. We can provide no
assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of the satellites.

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may relocate another satellite and
use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation would
require FCC approval and, among other things, a showing to the FCC that the replacement satellite
would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be
certain that we could obtain such FCC approval. If we choose to use a satellite in this manner,
this use could adversely affect our ability to meet the operation deadlines associated with our
authorizations. Failure to meet those deadlines could result in the loss of such authorizations,
which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.

We have made substantial capital commitments to acquire additional satellite capacity and do not
have firm business plans for some of this capacity; our results of operations could be materially
adversely affected if we are not able to utilize all of this additional capacity.

We are significantly increasing our satellite capacity as a result of the agreements discussed
above and other satellite service agreements currently under negotiation. While we are currently
evaluating various opportunities to make profitable use of this capacity (including, but not
limited to, increasing our international programming and other services, expanding our local and HD
programming, offering fixed satellite service capacity on a wholesale commercial basis (rather than
direct to consumers) and supplying satellite capacity for new international ventures), we do not
have firm plans to utilize all of the additional satellite capacity we expect to acquire. In
addition, there can be no assurance that we can successfully develop the business opportunities we
currently plan to pursue with this additional capacity. Future costs associated with this
additional capacity will negatively impact our margins if



we do not have sufficient growth in subscribers or in demand for new programming or services to
generate revenue to offset the costs of this increased capacity.

Complex technology used in our business could become obsolete.

Our operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to
introduce new products and services on a timely basis and to reduce costs of our existing products
and services. We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or
develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner. The success of new
product development depends on many factors, including proper identification of customer need,
cost, timely completion and introduction, differentiation from offerings of competitors and market
acceptance.

Technology in the subscription television and satellite services industries changes rapidly as new
technologies are developed, which could cause our services and products to become obsolete. We and
our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments. If the new
technologies on which we intend to focus our research and development investments fail to achieve
acceptance in the marketplace, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our future competitive
position that could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings. We may also be at a
competitive disadvantage in developing and introducing complex new products and technologies
because of the substantial costs we may incur in making these products or technologies available
across our installed base of over 13 million subscribers. For example, our competitors could be
the first to obtain proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior.
Further, after we have incurred substantial research and development costs, one or more of the
technologies under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners,
could become obsolete prior to its introduction. In addition, delays in the delivery of components
or other unforeseen problems in our DBS system or other satellite services may occur that could
materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new services and remain
competitive.

Technological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the
work of technically skilled employees. Competition for the services of these types of employees is
vigorous. We may not be able to attract and retain these employees. If we are unable to attract
and maintain technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially and
adversely affected.

We rely on key personnel.

We believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of
Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain other executives. The loss
of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Although all of our executives have
executed agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors if they leave
us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them.

We are controlled by one principal stockholder.

Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, currently beneficially owns
approximately 49.1% of our total equity securities and possesses approximately 76.8% of the total
voting power. Thus, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control
all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result of Mr. Ergen’s voting
power, ECC is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not
subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have (i) a majority of
independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii)
compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a
compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees
selected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of the independent
directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.



Our business depends substantially on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and
applications that may not be granted.

If the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to
us, potentially reducing the amount of programming and other services available to our subscribers.
The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the
location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, Congress
often considers and enacts legislation that could affect us, and FCC proceedings to implement the
Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing. We cannot predict the outcomes of
these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.

Our business relies on intellectual property, some of which is owned by third parties, and we may
inadvertently infringe their patents and proprietary rights.

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that
we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products infringes on
intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those
products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or
to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims. If those
intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual
property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Please see further
discussion under

Item 1. Business — Patents and Trademarks

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We depend on other telecommunications providers, independent retailers and others to solicit
orders for DISH network services.

While we offer receiver systems and programming directly, a majority of our new subscriber
acquisitions are generated by independent businesses offering our products and services, including
small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores,
nationwide retailers, telecommunications providers and others. If we are unable to continue our
arrangements with these resellers, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain other sales
agents, thus adversely affecting our business.

We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt

As of December 31, 2006, our total debt, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was $6.967
billion. On February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2008 which decreased our total debt by $1.0 billion.

Our debt levels could have significant consequences, including:



In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures
relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt. If new debt is added to our
current debt levels, the risks we now face could intensify.

We may need additional capital, which may not be available, in order to continue growing, to
increase earnings and to make payments on our debt.

Our ability to increase earnings and to make interest and principal payments on our debt will
depend in part on our ability to continue growing our business by maintaining and increasing our
subscriber base. This may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us.

Funds necessary to meet subscriber acquisition and retention costs are expected to be satisfied
from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations
to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet
these requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

In addition to our DBS business plan, we have contracts to construct, and conditional licenses and
pending FCC applications for, a number of FSS Ku-band, Ka-band and extended Ku-band satellites. We
may need to raise additional capital to construct, launch, and insure satellites and complete these
systems and other satellites we may in the future apply to operate. We also periodically evaluate
various strategic initiatives, the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant
additional capital. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all.

We also have substantial satellite-related payment obligations under our various satellite service
agreements.

We may be unable to manage rapidly expanding operations.

If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. To manage our growth effectively, we
must, among other things, continue to develop our internal and external sales forces, installation
capability, customer service operations and information systems, and maintain our relationships
with third party vendors. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base,
and our management personnel must assume even greater levels of responsibility. If we are unable
to continue to manage growth effectively, we may experience a decrease in subscriber growth and an
increase in churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability.

Due to the substantial expenditures necessary to complete construction, launch and deployment of
our DBS system and to obtain and service DISH Network customers, we have in the past sustained
significant losses. If we do not have sufficient income or other sources of cash, our ability to
service our debt and pay our other obligations could be affected. While we had net income of
$608.3 million, $1.515 billion and $214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, we may not be able to sustain this profitability. Improvements in our results
of operations will depend largely upon our ability to increase our customer base while maintaining
our price structure, effectively managing our costs and controlling churn. We cannot assure you
that we will be effective with regard to these matters.

We depend on few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for many components of
consumer premises equipment; we may be adversely affected by product shortages.

We depend on relatively few sources, and in some cases a single source, for many components of the
consumer premises equipment that we provide to subscribers in order to deliver our digital
television services. Product shortages and resulting installation delays could cause us to lose
potential future subscribers to our DISH Network service.



We
could be exposed to significant financial losses if our international
business ventures are
unsuccessful.

We have entered into certain strategic transactions in Asia, and we may increase our strategic
investment activity in these and other international markets. These investments, which we expect
could become substantial over time, involve a high degree of risk and could expose us to
significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful.

These risks include, among other things, the risks that required regulatory approvals may not be
obtained, that we may not be able to enter into necessary distribution and other relationships, and
that the companies in which we invest or with whom we partner may not be able to compete
effectively in these markets or that there may be insufficient demand for the new services planned
for these markets.

We cannot assure you that there will not be deficiencies leading to material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting.

We periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This evaluation and testing of internal
control over financial reporting includes internal control over financial reporting relating to our
operations. Although our management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006, if in the future we are unable to report that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree with our
assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal control
over financial reporting), investors, customers and business partners could lose confidence in the
accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Distant Network Litigation

On October 20, 2006, a District Court in Florida entered a permanent nationwide injunction
prohibiting us from offering distant network channels to consumers effective December 1, 2006.
Distant networks are ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox network channels which originate outside the community
where the consumer who wants to view them, lives. We have turned off all of our distant network
channels and are no longer in the distant network business. Termination of these channels resulted
in, among other things, a small reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and free cash
flow, and a temporary increase in subscriber churn. The plaintiffs in that litigation allege that
we are in violation of the Court’s injunction and have appealed a District Court decision finding
that we are not in violation. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of that
appeal.



Superguide

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) filed suit against us, DirecTV, Thomson and others in
the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division,
alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,038,211 (the ‘211 patent), 5,293,357 (the ‘357
patent) and 4,751,578 (the ‘578 patent) which relate to certain electronic program guide functions,
including the use of electronic program guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and
declaratory relief and damages in an unspecified amount.

On summary judgment, the District Court ruled that none of the asserted patents were infringed by
us. These rulings were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
During 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court’s
findings and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. In 2005,
SuperGuide indicated that it would no longer pursue infringement allegations with respect to the
‘211 and ‘357 patents and those patents have now been dismissed from the suit. The District Court
subsequently entered judgment of non-infringement in favor of all defendants as to the ‘211 and
‘357 patents and ordered briefing on Thomson’s license defense as to the ‘578 patent. During
December 2006, the District Court found that there were disputed issues of fact regarding Thomson’s
license defense, and ordered a trial solely addressed to that issue for March 2007. We also
requested leave to add a license defense as to the ‘578 patent in view of a new (at the time)
license we obtained from a third-party licensed by Superguide. Activity in the case as to us is
suspended pending resolution of the Thomson license defense issue.

We examined the ‘578 patent and believe that it is not infringed by any of our products or
services. We will continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain
user-friendly electronic programming guide and related features that we currently offer to
consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

In 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. (“Broadcast Innovation”) filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV,
Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the
‘066 patent). The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and
receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data. The ‘066 patent relates to
certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on
removable cards. We examined these patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our
products or services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving
us as the only defendant.

During 2004, the judge issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid. Also in 2004, the Court
ruled the ‘094 invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter and
Comcast. In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) overturned
this finding of invalidity and remanded the case back to the District Court. During June 2006,
Charter filed a reexamination request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The
Court has stayed the case pending reexamination. Our case remains stayed pending resolution of the
Charter case.

We intend to continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the
suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.



Tivo Inc.

During April 2006, a Texas jury concluded that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs,
infringed a patent held by Tivo. The Texas court subsequently issued an injunction prohibiting us
from offering DVR functionality. A Court of Appeals has stayed that injunction during the pendency
of our appeal.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“SFAS 5”), we recorded a total reserve of $94.0 million in “Tivo litigation expense” on our
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect the jury verdict, supplemental damages
and pre-judgment interest awarded by the Texas court through September 8, 2006. Based on our
current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is
more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, we are not recording additional
amounts for supplemental damages or interest subsequent to the September 8, 2006 judgment date. If
the verdict is upheld on appeal, the $94.0 million amount would
increase by approximately
$35.0 million through 2007.

If the verdict is upheld on appeal and we are not able to successfully implement alternative
technology (including the successful defense of any challenge that such technology infringes Tivo’s
patent), we would owe substantial additional damages and we could also be prohibited from
distributing DVRs, or be required to modify or eliminate certain user-friendly DVR features that we
currently offer to consumers. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our
competitors who could offer this functionality and, while we would attempt to provide that
functionality through other manufacturers, the adverse affect on our business could be material.

Acacia

In June 2004, Acacia Media Technologies (“Acacia”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast,
Charter, Cox and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants. Acacia is an intellectual
property holding company which seeks to license the patent portfolio that it has acquired. The
suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992 (the ‘992 patent), 5,253,275 (the
‘275 patent), 5,550,863 (the ‘863 patent), 6,002,720 (the ‘720 patent) and 6,144,702 (the ‘702
patent). The ‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘702 patents have been asserted against us.

The patents relate to various systems and methods related to the transmission of digital data. The
‘992 and ‘702 patents have also been asserted against several Internet content providers in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. During 2004 and 2005, the
Court issued Markman rulings which found that the ‘992 and ‘702 patents were not as broad as Acacia
had contended, and that certain terms in the ‘702 patent were indefinite. During April 2006,
EchoStar and other defendants asked the Court to rule that the claims of the ‘702 patent are
invalid and not infringed. That motion is pending. In June and September 2006, the Court held
Markman hearings on the ‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘275 patents, and issued a ruling during December
2006. We believe the decision is generally favorable to us, but we can not predict whether it will
result in dismissal of the case.

Acacia’s various patent infringement cases have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the
patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the
suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Forgent

In July 2005, Forgent Networks, Inc. (“Forgent”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit also named DirecTV, Charter, Comcast,
Time Warner Cable, Cable One and Cox as defendants. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent No. 6,285,746 (the ‘746 patent).

The ‘746 patent discloses a video teleconferencing system which utilizes digital telephone lines.
We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe this patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain
user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers. Trial is currently scheduled for May
2007 in Tyler, Texas. On October 2, 2006, the Patent and Trademark Office granted our petition for
reexamination



of the ‘746 patent. On October 27, 2006, the Patent and Trademark Office issued its initial office
action rejecting all of the claims of the ‘746 patent in light of several prior art references.
Forgent will have an opportunity to challenge the initial office action. We cannot predict with
any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability
or damages.

Finisar Corporation

Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) recently obtained a $100.0 million verdict in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against DirecTV for patent infringement. Finisar
alleged that DirecTV’s electronic program guide and other elements of its system infringe United
States Patent No. 5,404,505 (the ‘505 patent).

On July 10, 2006, we, together with NagraStar LLC, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Finisar that asks the Court
to declare that they and we do not infringe, and have not infringed, any valid claim of the ‘505
patent. Trial is not currently scheduled. We intend to vigorously defend our rights in this
action. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we may be
subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that could
require us to modify our system architecture. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the
outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Trans Video

In August 2006, Trans Video Electronic, Ltd. (“Trans Video”) filed a patent infringement action
against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,903,621 (the ‘621 patent) and 5,991,801 (the
‘801 patent). The patents relate to various methods related to the transmission of digital data by
satellite. Trial has been set for July 2008. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the
event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to
substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction. We cannot predict with
any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability
or damages.

Retailer Class Actions

During 2000, lawsuits were filed by retailers in Colorado state and federal court attempting to
certify nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The
plaintiffs are requesting the Courts declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged
agreements between us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost
incentives and payments, charge backs, and other compensation. We are vigorously defending against
the suits and have asserted a variety of counterclaims. The federal court action has been stayed
during the pendency of the state court action. We filed a motion for summary judgment on all
counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a motion for additional time to conduct
discovery to enable them to respond to our motion. The Court granted limited discovery which ended
during 2004. The plaintiffs claimed we did not provide adequate disclosure during the discovery
process. The Court agreed, and recently denied our motion for summary judgment as a result. A
trial date has not been set. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the
suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment

During October 2001, we received approximately $40.0 million from the sale of Enron commercial
paper to a third party broker. That commercial paper was ultimately purchased by Enron. During
November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York against approximately 100 defendants, including us, who invested in Enron’s
commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 purchase of its commercial paper
was a fraudulent conveyance and voidable preference under bankruptcy laws. We dispute these
allegations. We typically invest in commercial paper and notes which are rated in one of the four
highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
At the time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was considered to be high quality and
low risk. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.



Riyad Alshuaibi

During 2002, Riyad Alshuaibi filed suit against Michael Kelly, one of our executive officers, Kelly
Broadcasting Systems, Inc. (“KBS”), and EchoStar in the District Court of New Jersey. Plaintiff
alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, and unjust enrichment
resulting in damages in excess of $50.0 million. We denied the allegations of plaintiff’s
complaint. On October 26, 2006, we reached a settlement which did not have a material impact on
our results of operations.

Other

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability
with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

During 2006, we continued to position the DISH Network as the low price leader in the U.S. pay TV
industry, while at the same time offering the highest quality programming, customer service and
customer choice possible. We subsidize the cost of equipment and installation, and offer other
promotions, to increase our subscriber base. We also focused on increasing distribution of our
highly rated DVR and HD equipment, as value ads to drive subscriber growth and retention.

As a result, our subscriber base continued to grow. That growth, together with increased average
monthly revenue per subscriber, resulted in continued revenue growth. Net income and free cash
flow also continued to increase.

We believe opportunity exists to continue growing our subscriber base. One of our biggest
challenges, and opportunities, is to further improve operating results through better cost control
and operating efficiency.

Operational Results and Goals

Adding new subscribers.

During 2006, we added approximately 3.516 million new subscribers, an
increase of 3.4% from 2005. We intend to continue adding new subscribers by offering compelling
value-based consumer promotions. These promotions include offers of free or low cost advanced
consumer electronics products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, HD receivers, DVRs, and HD
DVRs, as well as programming packages which we believe generally have a better “price-to-value”
relationship than packages currently offered by most other subscription television providers.

However, there are many reasons we may not be able to maintain our current rate of new subscriber
growth. For example, many of our competitors are better equipped than we are to offer video
services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services. Our subscriber growth would
also be negatively impacted to the extent our competitors offer more attractive consumer
promotions.

Minimize existing customer churn.

In order to continue to increase our subscriber base we must
minimize our rate of customer turnover, or “churn.” Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for
the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 1.64%. We attempt to contain churn by offering
high quality customer service, low prices, and advanced products and services not available from
competitors. We also require service commitments from subscribers and tailor our promotions toward
subscribers desiring multiple receivers and advanced products such as receivers with multiple
tuners, DVRs and HD receivers, who tend to remain our customers for longer periods. In addition,
we maintain disciplined credit requirements, such as requiring most new subscribers to provide a
valid major credit card and to have an acceptable credit score. We also plan to continue to offer
advanced products to existing customers through our lease promotions and to initiate other programs
to improve our overall subscriber retention. However, there can be no assurance that these and
other actions we may take to control churn will be successful.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Reduce costs.

We believe that our low cost structure is one of our key competitive advantages and
we continue to work aggressively to retain this position. We are attempting to control costs by
improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the
reliability of our equipment, providing better subscriber education in the use of our products and
services, and enhancing our training and quality assurance programs for our in-home service and
call center representatives. We believe that further standardization of EchoStar receiver systems,
introduction of new installation technology and the migration away from relatively expensive and
complex subscriber equipment installations may reduce in-home service and customer service calls.
In addition, we hope to further reduce our customer service calls by simplifying processes such as
billing and non-technical equipment issues. However, these initiatives may not be sufficient to
maintain or increase our operational efficiencies and we may not be able to continue to grow our
operations cost effectively.

We also attempt to reduce subscriber acquisition and retention costs by lowering the overall cost
of subsidized equipment we provide to new and existing customers and improving the cost
effectiveness of our sales efforts. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber
equipment is to lease our receiver systems to new and existing subscribers rather than selling
systems to them at little or no cost. Leasing enables us to, among other things, reduce our future
subscriber acquisition costs by redeploying equipment returned by disconnected lease subscribers.
We are further reducing the cost of subscriber equipment through our design and deployment of
EchoStar receivers with multiple tuners that allow the subscriber to receive our DISH Network
services in multiple rooms using a single receiver, thereby reducing the number of EchoStar
receivers we deploy to each subscriber household.

However, our overall costs to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers, including
amounts expensed and capitalized, both in the aggregate and on a per subscriber basis, may
materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions or
newer, more expensive consumer electronics products in response to new promotions and products
offered by our competitors or for other reasons. In addition, expanded use of new compression
technologies, such as MPEG-4 and 8PSK, will inevitably render some portion of our current and
future EchoStar receivers obsolete, and we will incur additional costs, which may be substantial,
to upgrade or replace these receivers. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from
such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of
our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs
will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers.

Domestic and international expansion.

Finally, we are actively involved in pursuing strategic
investment and other new business opportunities both domestically and abroad. These initiatives
include, among other things, our recently announced investments in satellite-delivered mobile video
ventures in China and Korea, as well as investments we make domestically in companies whose
products and services complement our core businesses or may be a strategic fit with our new
business initiatives. These investments are intended to provide new markets for future revenue and
long term strategic growth, as well as opportunities to leverage the introduction of new products
and services for the benefit of our core business. However, these investments involve a high
degree of risk. They could expose us to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures
are not successful.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS

Subscriber-related revenue

.

“Subscriber-related revenue” consists principally of revenue from
basic, movie, local, pay-per-view, and international subscription television services, equipment
rental fees, additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple
receivers, digital video
recorder (“DVR”) fees, advertising sales, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, equipment
upgrade fees, HD programming and other subscriber revenue. Therefore, not all of the amounts we
include in “Subscriber-related revenue” are recurring on a monthly basis. “Subscriber-related
revenue” also includes revenue from equipment sales, installation and other services related to our
original agreement with AT&T. Revenue from equipment sales to AT&T is deferred and recognized over
the estimated average co-branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and certain other
services performed at the request of AT&T is recognized upon
completion of the services. All prior period amounts were
reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Development and implementation fees received from AT&T are being recognized in
“Subscriber-related revenue” over the next several years. In order to estimate the amount
recognized monthly, we first divide the number of subscribers activated during the month under the
AT&T agreement by total estimated subscriber activations during the life of the contract. We then
multiply this percentage by the total development and implementation fees received from AT&T. The
resulting estimated amount is recognized monthly as revenue over the estimated average subscriber
life.

During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency
agreement with AT&T. We believe our overall economic return is similar under both arrangements.
However, the impact of subscriber acquisition on many of our line item business metrics was
substantially different under the original AT&T agreement, compared to most other sales channels
(including the revised AT&T agreement).



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Among other things, our “Subscriber-related revenue” has been impacted in a number of respects.
Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our revised AT&T agreement do
not generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue from AT&T. However, our
programming services revenue is greater for subscribers acquired under the revised AT&T agreement.

Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our original AT&T
agreement will continue to have a positive impact on “Subscriber-related revenue” over the
estimated average life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received
from AT&T will continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all
subscribers acquired under both the original and revised agreements with AT&T.

Equipment sales

.

“Equipment sales” include sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and related
components to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers.
“Equipment sales” also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other
distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. “Equipment sales” does
not include revenue from sales of equipment to AT&T.

Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related revenue
from “Equipment sales” to “Subscriber-related revenue.” All prior period amounts were reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation.

“Other” sales.

“Other” sales consist principally of satellite transmission revenue and C-band
subscription television service revenue.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” principally include programming
expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations,
overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs,
residual commissions paid to our distributers, refurbishment
and repair costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable
subscriber expenses. “Subscriber-related expenses” also include the cost of equipment sales, and
expenses related to installation and other services from our original agreement with AT&T. Cost of
equipment sales to AT&T are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co-branded
subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of
AT&T are recognized as the services are performed. All prior
period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period
presentation.

Under the revised AT&T agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in
“Subscriber acquisition costs” or in capital expenditures, rather than in “Subscriber-related
expenses.” We are continuing to include in “Subscriber-related expenses” the costs deferred from
equipment sales made to AT&T. These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the
subscribers acquired under the original AT&T agreement.

Satellite and transmission expenses

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses” include costs
associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels,
satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other
related services.

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” principally includes costs associated with
non-DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold to an international DBS service
provider and to other international customers. “Cost of sales – equipment” also includes
unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment
domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. “Cost of sales – equipment” does not include the
costs from sales of equipment to AT&T.

Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related expenses
from “Cost of sales – equipment” to “Subscriber-related expenses” and “Depreciation and
amortization.” All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

Cost of sales – other.

“Cost of sales – other” principally includes programming and other expenses
associated with the C-band subscription television service business of SNG and costs related to
satellite transmission services.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Subscriber acquisition costs

.

In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize
installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new
DISH Network subscribers. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” include the cost of EchoStar receiver
systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems
sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs
related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized
under our lease program for new subscribers from “Subscriber acquisition costs.”

As discussed above, under the revised AT&T agreement, equipment and installation costs previously
reflected in “Subscriber-related expenses” are being included in “Subscriber acquisition costs” or
in capital expenditures.

SAC.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the “average subscriber acquisition
costs per new subscriber activation,” or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be
calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all
new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with
little or no subscriber acquisition costs.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense
line item “Subscriber acquisition costs” for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers
added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our “Equivalent SAC” for the period by
adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other
offsetting amounts, as described below, to our “Subscriber acquisition cost” expense line item
prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition
cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video
programming distribution (“MVPD”) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs
of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on
Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new
subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only “Equivalent SAC,” which
we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as “Subscriber acquisition costs,” plus the value of
equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber
additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of
payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease
subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed
through our lease program, as described in that Form 10-Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006,
our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are
separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the
current period calculation.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses” consists primarily of
employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems,
accounting and finance, including non-cash, stock-based compensation expense related to the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting
services) and other items associated with facilities and administration.

Interest expense.

“Interest expense” primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and
amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated
debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital
lease obligations.

“Other” income (expense).

The main components of “Other” income and expense are unrealized gains
and losses from changes in fair value of non-marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair
value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of
investments, and impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).

EBITDA is defined as
“Net income (loss)” plus “Interest expense” net of “Interest income,” “Taxes” and “Depreciation and
amortization.”

DISH Network subscribers.

We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our
retail networks, including our co-branding relationship with AT&T and other distribution
relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for
co-branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to
hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide
our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, America’s Top 100
(but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting
number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our
DISH Network subscriber count.

During April 2004, we acquired a C-band subscription television service business, the assets of
which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of
these customer relationships from C-band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS
subscription television service, acquired C-band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network
subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber (“ARPU”)

.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for
calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other
companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber,
or ARPU, by dividing average monthly “Subscriber-related revenues” for the period (total
“Subscriber-related revenue” during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by
our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are
calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and
dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month
are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and
dividing by two.

Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover

.

We are not aware of any uniform standards for
calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be
calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate
percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who
terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that
month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH
Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network
subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the
period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by
adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by
the total number of months in the period.

Free cash flow

.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less
“Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

DISH Network subscribers

.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH
Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an
increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the
year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during
2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in
large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during
the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment
lease program.

DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31,
2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%.
This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size
of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines,
increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber
growth.

Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are
negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives,
including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications
services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer
electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD
programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing
competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers
over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at
current rates if we cannot control our customer churn.

Subscriber-related revenue.

DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $9.376 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This
increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in
“ARPU” discussed below.

ARPU

.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006
versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily
attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages,
higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing
programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by
satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our
original agreement with AT&T.

Equipment sales

.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, “Equipment sales” totaled $362.1 million, a
decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a
decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non-DISH
Network digital receivers and related components to international customers.

While we
currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu
and others through mid-year 2007,
we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new
compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy
to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our
equipment in the future.

Subscriber-related expenses.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $4.808 billion during the year
ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in
“Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH
Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned
EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation
and other services related to our original agreement with AT&T. “Subscriber-related expenses”
represented 51.3% of “Subscriber-related revenue” for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005.

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide
content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of
subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses
will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In
addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

“Subscriber-related expenses” as a percentage of “Subscriber-related revenue” could materially
increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages.

Satellite and transmission expenses

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled $147.5 million
during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005.
This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases
of AMC-15 and AMC-16. “Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of
“Subscriber-related revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet,
if we obtain in-orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital
broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched.

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” totaled $282.4 million during the year
ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase
primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory.
“Cost of sales – equipment” represented 78.0% and 73.8% of “Equipment sales,” during the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio
principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled $1.596 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in
“Subscriber acquisition costs” was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers
and a decline in the number of co-branded subscribers acquired under our original AT&T agreement,
for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to
higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH
Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The
introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006
compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense
increased.

SAC.

SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease
of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of
our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs,
partially offset by a decline in the number of co-branded subscribers acquired under our original
AT&T agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation
of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation.

Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to
lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no
cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment
to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy
to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC.

The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to
increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December
31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers
totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures
under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per
receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install
continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program
subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly
installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber
equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new
subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other
things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers.
However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically
as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological
changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all
returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with
redeployment of that returned lease equipment.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received
in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned
equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program.
During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1
million, respectively.

Our “Subscriber acquisition costs,” both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis,
may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if
we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further
discussion under

“Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs.”

General and administrative expenses.

“General and administrative expenses” totaled $551.5 million
during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005.
This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the
growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non-cash, stock-based compensation
expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non-income
based taxes. “General and administrative expenses” represented 5.6% and 5.4% of “Total revenue”
during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of
those expenses to “Total revenue” was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses
to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above.

Tivo litigation expense.

We recorded $94.0 million of “Tivo litigation expense” during the year
ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current
analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more
likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the
original judgment has been accrued.

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $1.114 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005.
The increase in “Depreciation and amortization” expense was primarily attributable to depreciation
of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease
programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable
assets placed in service to support the DISH Network.

Interest income.

“Interest income” totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006,
an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash
and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and
marketable investment securities during 2006.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.

“Interest expense” totaled $458.2 million during the
year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This
increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the
issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and
write-off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain
outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in
capitalized interest on construction of satellites.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

.

EBITDA was $2.369 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million “Gain on
insurance settlement” and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0
million “Tivo litigation expense.” Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA
(excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses
discussed above.

income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of
operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure
for those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video programming distribution industry.
Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to
service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Income tax benefit (provision), net.

Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year
ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax
benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million
to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity,
respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a
credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards
(“NOLs”) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of
$8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to
reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

DISH Network subscribers

.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH
Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an
increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new
subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new
subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in
gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co-branding
agreement with AT&T, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and
an increase in our other distribution channels.

DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of
approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a
larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our
co-branding agreement with AT&T. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained
constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net
subscriber growth.

Subscriber-related revenue

.

DISH Network “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $7.986 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This
increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in
“ARPU” discussed below.

ARPU

.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005
versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average
revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005
and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from
increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by
satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with AT&T,
including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement.
These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted
programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31,
2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new
DISH Network subscribers which provide free and/or discounted programming that negatively impact
ARPU.

Equipment sales

.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, “Equipment sales” totaled $368.0 million,
an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase
principally resulted from an increase in sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and related
components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS
accessories domestically.

Subscriber-related expenses.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $4.096 billion during the year
ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in
“Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH
Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network.
“Subscriber-related expenses” represented 51.3% and 54.1% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue
ratio primarily resulted from the increase in “Subscriber-related revenue” and an increase in the
number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers.
Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than
expensed, our “Subscriber-related expenses” decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The
decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and
in-home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by
increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related
to our relationship under our prior agreement with AT&T. The decrease in the ratio was also
partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement
of smart cards.

Satellite and transmission expenses

.

“Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled $134.5 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004.
This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with
the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as
previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC-2, and
operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC-15 and AMC-16 which commenced
commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. “Satellite and transmission
expenses” totaled 1.7% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during each of the years ended December 31,
2005 and



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite
fleet, if we obtain in-orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our
digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are
launched.

Cost of sales – equipment.

“Cost of sales – equipment” totaled $271.7 million during the year
ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase
related primarily to the increase in sales of non-DISH Network digital receivers and related
components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete
inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in
sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase.
“Cost of sales – equipment” represented 73.8% and 71.0% of “Equipment sales,” during the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio
principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and
on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005
charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory.

Subscriber acquisition costs.

“Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled $1.493 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in
“Subscriber acquisition costs” was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers
participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase
in the number of non co-branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising.

SAC.

SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an
increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of
co-branded subscribers acquired under our original AT&T agreement, for which we did not incur
subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher
priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers.
Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs
during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for
acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network.

Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to
2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled
approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales
caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our “Subscriber acquisition costs” declined.

As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received
in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned
equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program.
During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8
million, respectively.

General and administrative expenses.

“General and administrative expenses” totaled $456.2 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004.
The increase in “General and administrative expenses” was primarily attributable to increased
personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. “General and
administrative expenses” represented 5.4% and 5.6% of “Total revenue” during the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted
primarily from “Total revenue” increasing at a higher rate than our “General and administrative
expenses.”

Depreciation and amortization.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $805.6 million
during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004.
The increase in “Depreciation and amortization” expense was primarily attributable to additional
depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our
equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH
Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites, which commenced commercial
operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.

“Interest expense” totaled $373.8 million during the
year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This
decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write-off of debt issuance
costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to
the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which
occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest
expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC-15 and AMC-16
satellites.

Gain on insurance settlement.

During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims
for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net
amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0
million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a “Gain on insurance
settlement” during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Other.

“Other” income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
“Other” expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted
from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non-marketable strategic
investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond
instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially
offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of
an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during
the fourth quarter of 2005.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

.

EBITDA was $2.143 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion
during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating
revenues and expenses discussed above.

The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements:

operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure
for those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video programming distribution industry.
Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to
service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Income tax benefit (provision), net.

Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This
decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for
income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our
recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than
not to be realizable.

“Net income” was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an
increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily
attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher
“Operating income,” the “Gain on insurance settlement” and lower “Interest expense, net of amounts
capitalized.”

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long-term
notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption
of certain of our long-term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities.

Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0
billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the
principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with
unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February
2007.

We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will
be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from
operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent
upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no
assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to
fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other
things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and
retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment
lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of
investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale
commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed.
We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital
expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased
to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the
number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition
for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make
strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other
factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be
no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available
on acceptable terms.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities.

We consider all liquid investments
purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See “Item 7A. – Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion regarding our marketable
investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled
$3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities,
compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment
securities, as of December 31, 2005.

The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Free cash flow.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less
“Purchases of property and equipment,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We
believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period,
the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund
acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in
accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating income,” “Net
income,” “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other measure determined in accordance
with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP
liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure — “Net cash
flows from operating activities.”

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted
by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the “Net cash flows from operating
activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset
and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no
assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating
assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things,
management’s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to
fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary
significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth,
subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized
under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of
property and equipment and other factors.

The following table reconciles free cash flow to “Net cash flows from operating activities.”

Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an
increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease
in “Purchases of property and equipment” of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in “Net cash
flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net
income, net of changes in: (i) “Deferred tax expense (benefit);” (ii) “Gain on insurance
settlement;” and (iii) “Depreciation and amortization” expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash
resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The
2006 decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” was primarily attributable to a decline in
overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new
subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing
subscriber lease program.

The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in
“Net cash flows from operating activities” of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an
increase in “Purchases of property and equipment” of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in
“Net cash flows from operating activities” was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase
in net income, net of changes in: (i) “Deferred tax expense (benefit);” (ii) “Gain on insurance
settlement;” (iii) “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments;” and (iv) “Depreciation
and amortization” expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from
changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in “Purchases of property and equipment”
was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease
programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital
expenditures.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the
economy, strategic opportunities or other factors.

Cash flows from operating activities.

We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating
activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure.
For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating
activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of
changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in “Free cash flow” above.

Cash flows from investing activities.

Our investing activities generally include purchases and
sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our
infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of
$1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing
activities of $1.078 billion.

The
decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of
$533.6 million primarily
resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by
a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities
for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement.

The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of
marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005.
The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in
cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in
asset acquisitions during 2005.

Cash flows from financing activities.

Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the
issuance of long-term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long-term debt, and
capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common
stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we
reported net cash inflows from financing activities of
$1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of
$402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively.

The
improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following:

The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following:

•

During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of
our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the
10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007.

•

During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and
Class B common stock.

•

During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common
stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to
approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004.

The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash:

•

During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014
and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group
L.L.C.

Other Liquidity Items

Subscriber turnover.

Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006
was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber
churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase
in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering
more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and
services. Competitor bundling
of video services with 2-way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more
significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to
relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our
promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these
subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a
lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect.

Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains
constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to
sustain net subscriber growth.

Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also could cause subscriber churn to
increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called
“smart cards,” or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to
authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service
and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our
encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more
difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card
replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other
security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our
security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are
required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million.

Subscriber acquisition and retention costs.

Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can
vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net
income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs,” SAC and
“Subscriber-related expenses” may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more
aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition,
or for other reasons.

Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and
we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of
equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we
will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the
associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment
obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that
returned lease equipment.

Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation
technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost
to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than
if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK
technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming
channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the
acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and
create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG-4 technology in all
satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This
technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined
the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the
period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial
operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are
successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us
greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber
base to MPEG-4.

While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of
equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in
the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we
subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the
extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction
strategies.

In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for
upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar
receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to
upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our
retention costs, which are included in “Subscriber-related expenses,” and our capital expenditures
related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the
short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital
expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the
extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we
introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive
promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other
reasons.

Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be
satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from
operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the
future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and
equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites
under Construction.

We have entered into contracts to
construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be
completed within the next three years, see “Item 1 — Business — Our Satellites.” Future
commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under “Satellite-related
obligations” except where noted below.

•

During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is
expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second
half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider,
Sea Launch.

•

During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional
SSL Ka and/or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008
and 2009.

•

CMBStar, an S-band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of
2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and
contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of
that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory
entity.

•

During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV
which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this
satellite are not included in the table above.

Leased Satellites.

In addition to our lease of the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites discussed below
under

Capital Lease Obligations

, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease
capacity on other satellites, see “Item 1



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

— Business — Our Satellites.” Future commitments
related to these satellites are included in the table above under “Satellite-related obligations.”

•

We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in-orbit FSS satellite,
AMC-2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to
continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease.

•

An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC-14, which is currently expected to launch during late
2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future
date. The initial ten-year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be
accounted for as a capital lease.

•

A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the
second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15-year period
following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3
satellite agreement as a capital lease.

•

A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and
commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten-year
term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital
lease.

In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be
delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance
for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease
of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we
had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our
obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites.

Capital Lease Obligations

AMC-15.

We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the
capacity on AMC-15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten-year satellite service
agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us
with certain rights to replacement satellites.

AMC-16.

We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the
capacity on AMC-16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten-year
satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term,
and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, “Accounting for Leases”
(“SFAS 13”), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease
(see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease
payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under

Capital Lease Obligations

in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the
lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under

Satellite-Related
Obligations

in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is
included under

Interest on Long-Term Debt

in the table above.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver
systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH
Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to
purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to, among other things, management’s control of inventory levels, and can materially
impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital
requirements.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
— Continued

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming
content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the
number of subscribers to whom
we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table
above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate
increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful
growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Satellite insurance.

We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own.
We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures
because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite
failure. We believe we generally have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a
relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of
our in-orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international
and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of
multiple satellite losses.

Future capital requirements.

In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans
for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka-band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the
97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations.

As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we
anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during
2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396
billion.

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would
complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise
offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our
business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or
acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our
Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which
could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may
still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could
raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms.

Security Ratings

Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB- on our long-term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect
to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moody’s Investor Service and
Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies
reflect each agency’s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due.

With respect to Moody’s, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are
judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For S&P, the BB-
rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations
than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure
to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor’s
inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2008.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.
Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
— Continued

periods may be affected
by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting
policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of
our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•

Smart card replacement

.

We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards,
called “smart cards,” or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control
access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by
theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond
to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal
theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our
smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we
continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our
service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in
reducing theft of our programming signals.

As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At
the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would
accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and
owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to
be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and
historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the
replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement
reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement
as incurred.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48,
which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective
January 1, 2007.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
— Continued

We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements.
Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that
fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our
financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the
Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify
misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether
either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to
be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current-year financial statements.
If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material
using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative
effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first
fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006.

We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the
transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of
$37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial
statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each
12-month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy
between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years’
consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10
years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated
deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor
obligations.

We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years’ consolidated financial
statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted
under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in
liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect
adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006.

Seasonality

Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service
industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half
of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising
and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of
such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods.

Inflation

Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that
our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will
depend primarily on competitive pressures. We
do not have any material backlog of our products.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable
investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884
billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies;
(c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in
one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper
described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal
until the cash is required to,



among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and
expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is
received and used in our business.

Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an
average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease
in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest
income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other
things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the
risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we
hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies),
reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate
fluctuations.

At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments
or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely
impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to
maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result
in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the
effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be
re-invested at lower rates as the instruments mature.

Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public
companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic
and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million.
We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in
the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be
significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as
risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks
associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to
significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the
underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic
debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair
value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not
materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments.

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available-for-sale. We adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary
unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit),” net of related deferred income tax.
Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other
than temporary” are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable
investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to
the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and
company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the
contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of
less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for
a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine
whether any company or market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are
other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous
period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to
earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a
part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity
(deficit).” During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for
other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In
addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net
gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond
instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006,
our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair
value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis
or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying
value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in
future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value.



We also have several strategic investments in certain non-marketable equity securities which are
included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we
account for our unconsolidated equity
investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity
securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the
investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary
impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other
things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may
indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash
flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy.
The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in
circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had
$188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non-marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity
investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these
investments.

We also have a strategic investment in non-public preferred stock, public common stock and
convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuer’s publicly traded common
shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in
fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in
“Other” income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair
value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in
applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the
convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading
price of the issuer’s shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to
public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the
operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our
investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during
the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre-tax
unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in
the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million
recorded as part of the total equity investment in “Other non-current assets, net” for the amount
by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuer’s common stock exceeds the value of our
portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a
result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we
evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine
whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than
temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for
marketable securities, as discussed above.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly
traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital
to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets,
there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we
desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

As of
December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed-rate
debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair
value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market
prices where available. In  completing our analysis for our private
debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various
public and private offerings, and other publicly available
information. In
performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the
impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt and
mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed
interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the
extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are
required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed
interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million.

In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but
we may do so in the future.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule



13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
the end of the period covered by this report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and our directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). EchoStar Communications Corporation’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in
our opinion, EchoStar Communications Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar Communications Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated
February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar Communications Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of EchoStar Communications Corporation and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

As described in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements
in the Current Year Financial Statements

. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB No.
108, the Company recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax, to accumulated deficit as
of January 1, 2006. As discussed in note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of EchoStar Communications Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

1. Organization and Business Activities

Principal Business

EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC”) is a holding company. Its subsidiaries (which together
with ECC are referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) operate two
interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k – which provides a direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) subscription
television service in the United States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”)
– which designs and develops DBS receivers,
antennae and other digital equipment for the DISH Network. We refer to this equipment collectively
as “EchoStar receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and distributes similar equipment for
international customers.

We have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS System.” The EchoStar DBS
System consists of our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) authorized DBS and Fixed Satellite
Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, EchoStar receiver systems, digital
broadcast operations centers, customer service facilities, in-home service and call center
operations and certain other assets utilized in our operations. Our principal business strategy is
to continue developing our subscription television service in the United States to provide
consumers with a fully competitive alternative to others in the multi-channel video programming
distribution (“MVPD”) industry.

company to EDBS. Our satellite lease contracts are also held by a subsidiary of EDBS.
Substantially all of our operations are conducted by subsidiaries of EDBS.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

F-7


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which we have
controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method
when we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. When we
do not have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of an issuer, the cost
method is used. For entities that are considered variable interest entities we apply the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46-R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46-R”). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each
reporting period. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, allowances for
uncollectible accounts, inventory allowances, self insurance obligations, deferred taxes and
related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair values of financial instruments, fair value
of options granted under our stock-based compensation plans, fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired in business combinations, capital leases, asset impairments, useful lives of property,
equipment and intangible assets, retailer commissions, programming expenses, subscriber lives
including those related to our co-branding and other distribution relationships, royalty
obligations and smart card replacement obligations. Actual results may differ from previously
estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected
prospectively beginning in the period they occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar because
their sales and purchases are predominantly denominated in that currency. However, for our
subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars at the period end exchange rate and revenues and expenses based on
the exchange rates at the time such transactions arise, if known, or at the average rate for the
period. The difference is recorded to equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
Financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction and subsequent gains and losses related to
changes in the foreign currency are included in other miscellaneous income and expense. Net
transaction gains (losses) during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not significant.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 consist of money market funds,
government bonds, corporate notes and commercial paper. The cost of these investments approximates
their fair value.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Investment Securities and Restricted Cash

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available-for-sale. We adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary
unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit),” net of related deferred income tax.
Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other
than temporary” are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable
investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to
the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and
company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the
contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of
less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for
a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine
whether any company or market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are
other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous
period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to
earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8
million and $3.3 million, respectively, as a part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” within “Total stockholders’ equity (deficit).” During the year ended December 31, 2005, we
recorded aggregate charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of
certain of our marketable investment securities of $25.4 million, and established a new cost basis
for these securities. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, we did not record any
charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment
securities. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized
realized and
unrealized net gains (losses) on marketable investment securities and conversion
of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million, $34.3 million and ($9.0) million,
respectively.

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

The fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities aggregated $321.2 million and
$148.5 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the year ended December 31,
2006, our strategic investments, have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the
fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost
basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the
carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to
earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value.

The following table reflects the length of time that the individual securities have been in an
unrealized loss position, aggregated by investment category, where those declines are considered
temporary in accordance with our policy.

Government Bonds

.

We believe the unrealized losses on our government bonds were caused primarily
by interest rate increases. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, maturities on these government bonds
ranged from one to eight months. We have the ability and intent to hold these investments until
maturity when the Government is required to redeem them at their full face value. Accordingly, we
do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2006.

Corporate Equity Securities.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the unrealized loss on our
investments in corporate equity securities represents an investment in the marketable common stock
of three companies in the communications industry and one company in the satellite communications
service industry, respectively. We are not aware of any specific factors which indicate the
unrealized loss is due to anything other than temporary market fluctuations.

Other Non-Marketable Securities.

We also have several strategic investments in certain
non-marketable equity securities which are included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under
either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not
publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments;
however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a
quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company
business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an
impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow
concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in
business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are
identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December
31, 2006 and 2005, we had $188.6 million and $94.2 million aggregate carrying amount of
non-marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, respectively, of which $97.8
million and $52.7 million is accounted for under the cost method, respectively. During the year
ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these
investments. During the years ended

F-10


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

December 31, 2005 and 2004, we did not record any charge to
earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our non-marketable investment
securities.

We also have a strategic investment in non-public preferred stock, public common stock and
convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuer’s publicly traded common
shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in
fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in
“Other” income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair
value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in
applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of
the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million and $42.3 million,
respectively, based on the trading price of the issuer's shares on
that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to
public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the
operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our
investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized a pre-tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million and a gain of $38.8 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million
recorded as part of the total equity investment in “Other non-current assets, net” for the amount
by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuer’s common stock exceeds the value of our
portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly
traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital
to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets,
there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we
desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, restricted
cash and marketable investment securities included amounts set aside as collateral for investments
in marketable securities and our letters of credit. Additionally, restricted cash and marketable
investment securities as of December 31, 2006 included $101.3 million in escrow related to our
litigation with Tivo.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out method. Proprietary products are built by contract manufacturers to our
specifications. We depend on a few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for the
production of our receivers and many components of our EchoStar receiver systems. Manufactured
inventories include materials, labor, freight-in, royalties and manufacturing overhead.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Cost includes capitalized interest of $20.1 million,
$7.6 million, and $3.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The costs of satellites under construction, including certain amounts prepaid under
our satellite service agreements, are capitalized during the construction phase, assuming the
eventual successful launch and in-orbit operation of the satellite. If a satellite were to fail
during launch or while in-orbit, the resultant loss would be charged to expense in the period such
loss was incurred. The amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance
proceeds estimated to be received, if any. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over
lives ranging from one to forty years. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when
incurred. Renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

We account for impairments of long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 144”). We review our long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Based on the guidance under SFAS 144, we evaluate our satellite
fleet for recoverability as one asset group. For assets which are held and used in operations, the
asset would be impaired if the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its
undiscounted future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment is
reported as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value as estimated using
discounted cash flows. Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We consider relevant cash flow, estimated future
operating results, trends and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value
of assets are recoverable.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), which
requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but to be
tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairments arise. Intangible assets that
have finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Our intangible
assets consist primarily of FCC licenses. Generally, we have determined that our FCC licenses have
indefinite useful lives due to the following:

•

FCC spectrum is a non-depleting asset;

•

Existing DBS licenses are integral to our business and will contribute to cash flows indefinitely;

F-12


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

•

Replacement satellite applications are generally authorized by the FCC subject to
certain conditions, without substantial cost under a stable regulatory, legislative and
legal environment;

•

Maintenance expenditures in order to obtain future cash flows are not significant;

•

DBS licenses are not technologically dependent; and

•

We intend to use these assets indefinitely.

In accordance with the guidance of EITF Issue No. 02-7, “Unit of Accounting for Testing
Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset” (“EITF 02-7”), we combine all our indefinite life
FCC licenses into a single unit of accounting. The analysis encompasses future cash flows from
satellites transmitting from such licensed orbital locations, including revenue attributable to
programming offerings from such satellites, the direct operating and subscriber acquisition costs
related to such programming, and future capital costs for replacement satellites. Projected
revenue and cost amounts included current and projected subscribers. In conducting our annual
impairment test in 2006, we determined that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses,
calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded their carrying amount.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, our identifiable intangibles subject to amortization consisted of
the following:

Amortization of these intangible assets, recorded on a straight line basis over an average finite
useful life primarily ranging from approximately three to twenty years, was $36.8 million and $39.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The aggregate amortization
expense is estimated to be $36.5 million for 2007, $22.9 million for 2008, $18.1 million annually
for each of the years 2009 through 2011 and $80.8 million thereafter.

The excess of our investments in consolidated subsidiaries over net tangible and intangible asset
value at acquisition is recorded as goodwill. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $3.4
million of goodwill. In conducting our annual impairment test in 2006, we determined that the
carrying amount of our goodwill was not impaired.

Smart Card Replacement

We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called “smart cards,” or in security
chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our
signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the
future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures
intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the
replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system,
we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service.
There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our
programming signals.

As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future
smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine
existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a
liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers
sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based
on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a
number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical
subscriber churn trends. With respect to receivers we lease, we would
record the expenses of replacement as incurred. The total replacement
cost could exceed $100.0 million.

Long-Term Deferred Revenue, Distribution and Carriage Payments

Certain programmers provide us up-front payments. Such amounts are deferred and in accordance with
EITF Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor” (“EITF 02-16”) are recognized as reductions to “Subscriber-related
expenses” on a straight-line basis over the relevant remaining contract term (up to 10 years). The
current and long-term portions of these deferred credits are recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in “Deferred revenue and other” and “Long-term deferred revenue, distribution and carriage
payments and other long-term liabilities,” respectively.

We receive equity interests in content providers in consideration for or in conjunction with
affiliation agreements. We account for these equity interests received in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-8, “Accounting by a Grantee for an Equity Instrument to be Received
in Conjunction with Providing Goods or Services” (“EITF 00-8”). During the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we made cash payments and entered into agreements and in 2004 assumed
certain liabilities in exchange for equity interests in certain entities.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded approximately $25.0 million, nil and $77.3 million related
to the fair value of these equity interests in “Other noncurrent assets,” respectively. These
unconsolidated investments are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of
accounting. Of the amounts recorded during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
approximately $25.0 million, nil
and $56.5 million in value of these equity interests was recorded as a deferred credit,
respectively, and are recognized as a reduction to “Subscriber-related expenses” ratably as our
actual costs are incurred under the related agreements in accordance with the guidance under EITF
02-16. These deferred credits are included as a component of current “Deferred revenue and other”
and “Long-term deferred revenue, distribution and carriage payments and other long-term
liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Sales Taxes

In accordance with the guidance of EITF Issue No. 06-3, “How Taxes Collected from Customers and
Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement” (“EITF 06-3”), we
account for sales taxes imposed on our goods and services on a net basis in our “Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).” Since
we primarily act as an agent for the
governmental authorities, the amount charged to the customer is collected and remitted directly to
the appropriate jurisdictional entity.

Income Taxes

We establish a provision for income taxes currently payable or receivable and for income tax
amounts deferred to future periods in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets or
liabilities be recorded for the estimated future tax effects of differences that exist between the
book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are offset by valuation
allowances in accordance with SFAS 109, when we believe it is more likely than not that such net
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair values for our publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices. The fair
values of our private debt is estimated based on an analysis in which we evaluate market
conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available
information. In performing this analysis, we make various
assumptions, among other things, regarding credit spreads,
 and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

Costs of issuing debt are generally deferred and amortized to interest expense over the terms of
the respective notes (Note 5).

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, prices are determinable, collectibility is
reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered. Revenue from our subscription
television services is recognized when programming is broadcast to subscribers. Programming
payments received from subscribers in advance of the broadcast or service period are recorded as
“Deferred revenue” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earned. For certain of our promotions
relating to EchoStar receiver systems, subscribers are charged an upfront fee. A portion of this
fee may be deferred and recognized over 48 to 60 months, depending on whether the fee is received from
existing or new subscribers. Revenue from advertising sales is recognized when the related services
are performed.

Subscriber
fees for receivers with multiple tuners, high definition
(“HD”) receivers, digital video recorders
(“DVRs”), and HD DVRs, our DishHOME Protection Plan and
other services are recognized as revenue, monthly as earned. Revenue
from equipment sales is recognized upon shipment to customers.

Revenue from equipment sales to AT&T pursuant to our original agreement with AT&T is deferred and
recognized over the estimated average co-branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and
certain other services performed at the request of AT&T is recognized upon completion of the
services. Further, development and

F-15


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

implementation fees received from AT&T will continue to be
recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the
original and revised agreements with AT&T.

Accounting for certain of our existing and new subscriber promotions which include programming
discounts and subscriber rebates falls under the scope of EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Capital
Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). In accordance with EITF 01-9, programming revenues under these promotions
are recorded as earned at the discounted monthly rate charged to the subscriber. See “Subscriber
Promotions” below for discussion regarding the accounting for costs under these promotions.

Subscriber-Related Expenses

The cost of television programming distribution rights is generally incurred on a per subscriber
basis and various upfront carriage payments are recognized when the related programming is
distributed to subscribers. The cost of television programming rights to distribute live sporting
events for a season or tournament is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the
course of the season or tournament. “Subscriber-related expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) principally include programming expenses, costs incurred
in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, overhead costs associated with
our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs, residual commissions paid to
distributors, direct marketers, retailers and telecommunications partners, refurbishment and repair
costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber
expenses. These costs are recognized as the services are performed or as incurred.

“Subscriber-related expenses” also include the cost of sales from equipment sales, and expenses
related to installation and other services from our original agreement with AT&T. Cost of sales
from equipment sales to AT&T are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co-branded
subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of
AT&T are recognized as the services are performed. Under the revised AT&T agreement, we are
including costs from equipment and installations in “Subscriber acquisition costs” or, for leased
equipment, in capital expenditures, rather than in “Subscriber-related expenses.” We are continuing
to include in “Subscriber-related expenses” the costs deferred from equipment sales made to AT&T.
These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the subscribers acquired under the
original AT&T agreement.

Subscriber Acquisition Promotions

DISH Network subscribers have the choice of purchasing or leasing the satellite receiver and other
equipment necessary to receive our programming. We generally subsidize installation and all or a
portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers.
As a result of our promotions, most of our new subscribers choose to lease their equipment.

Equipment Lease Promotion.

We retain title to receivers and certain other equipment offered
pursuant to our equipment lease promotions. As a result, equipment leased to new and existing
subscribers is capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Subscriber Acquisition Costs.

Subscriber acquisition costs in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) consist of costs incurred to acquire new subscribers
through third parties and our direct customer acquisition distribution channel. Subscriber
acquisition costs include the following line items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss):

•

“Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes the cost of EchoStar receiver
systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment and receiver systems sold
directly by us to subscribers.

•

“Other subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes net costs related to promotional
incentives and costs related to installation.

F-16


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

•

“Subscriber acquisition advertising”

includes advertising and marketing expenses related
to the acquisition of new DISH Network subscribers. Advertising costs generally are
expensed as incurred.

Accounting for dealer sales under our promotions fall within the scope of EITF 01-9. In accordance
with that guidance, we characterize amounts paid to our independent dealers as consideration for
equipment installation services and for equipment buydowns (commissions and rebates) as a reduction
of revenue. We expense payments for equipment installation services as “Other subscriber promotion
subsidies.” Our payments for equipment buydowns represent a partial or complete return of the
dealer’s purchase price and are, therefore, netted against the proceeds received from the dealer.
We report the net cost from our various sales promotions through our independent dealer network as
a component of “Other subscriber promotion subsidies.” No net proceeds from the sale of subscriber
related equipment pursuant to our subscriber acquisition promotions are recognized as revenue.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled
$56.7 million, $46.1 million and $40.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (“SFAS 128”) requires
entities to present both basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
stock options were exercised and convertible securities were converted to common stock.

The potential dilution from our subordinated notes convertible into common stock was computed using
the “if converted method.” Since we reported net income attributable to common stockholders for the
years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the potential dilution from stock options
exercisable into common stock for these periods was computed using the treasury stock method based
on the average market value of our Class A common stock for the period. The following table
reflects the basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share amounts for all periods are presented below in
accordance with the requirements of SFAS 128.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes –
An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48,
which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective
January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles

F - 18


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements.
Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that
fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our
financial position and results of operations.

During April 2006, a Texas jury concluded that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs,
infringed a patent held by Tivo. The Texas court subsequently issued an injunction prohibiting us
from offering DVR functionality. A Court of Appeals has stayed that injunction during the pendency
of our appeal.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“SFAS 5”), we recorded a total reserve of $94.0 million in “Tivo litigation expense” on our
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect the jury verdict, supplemental damages
and pre-judgment interest awarded by the Texas court through September 8, 2006. Based on our
current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is
more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, we are not recording additional
amounts for supplemental damages or interest subsequent to the September 8, 2006 judgment date. If
the verdict is upheld on appeal, additional supplemental damages and interest of approximately
$35.0 million would be payable through 2007.

If the verdict is upheld on appeal and we are not able to successfully implement alternative
technology (including the successful defense of any challenge that such technology infringes Tivo’s
patent), we would owe substantial additional damages and we could also be prohibited from
distributing DVRs, or be required to modify or eliminate certain user-friendly DVR features that we
currently offer to consumers. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our
competitors who could offer this functionality and, while we would attempt to provide that
functionality through other manufacturers, the adverse affect on our business could be material.

3. Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As
Amended), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”) which (i) revises Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 123, “Accounting and Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation,” (“SFAS 123”) to
eliminate both the disclosure only provisions of that statement and the alternative to follow the
intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and related interpretations, and (ii) requires the cost
resulting from all share-based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the results of
operations over the period during which an employee provides the requisite service in exchange for
the award and establishes fair value as the measurement basis of the cost of such transactions.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method.

Total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, net of related tax effect, as of December 31,
2006 was $11.0 million and was allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation
for key employees who participate in our stock option plans, as follows:

Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25 and
applied the disclosure only provisions of SFAS 123. Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share was required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if we had accounted for our
stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed by that statement. For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options was amortized to expense
over the options’ vesting period on a straight-line basis. We accounted for forfeitures as they
occurred. Compensation previously recognized was reversed in the event of forfeitures of unvested
options. The following table illustrates the effect on net income
(loss) per share as if we had
accounted for our stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method under SFAS 123:

During December 2004, we paid a one-time dividend of $1 per outstanding share of our Class A and
Class B common stock. We do not currently plan to pay additional dividends on our common stock,
and therefore the dividend yield percentage is set at zero for all periods. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which
have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Consequently, our estimate of fair value
may differ from other valuation models. Further, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate. Therefore, the existing models do not provide as reliable of a single
measure of the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as a market-based model would.
Changes in the intervals of our regular historical price observations from daily to monthly,
contributed to the 2005 reduction in our estimated volatility factor.

We will continue to evaluate the assumptions used to derive the estimated fair value of options for
our stock as new events or changes in circumstances become known.

Stock Incentive Plans

We have adopted stock incentive plans to attract and retain officers, directors and key employees.
As of December 31, 2006, we had 66.6 million shares of our Class A common stock authorized for
awards under our Stock Incentive Plans. In general, stock options granted through December 31,
2006 have included exercise prices not less than the

F-20


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

market value of our Class A common stock at
the date of grant and a maximum term of ten years. While historically our Board of Directors has
issued options that vest at the rate of 20% per year, some option grants have immediately vested.

Effective January 26, 2005, we adopted a long-term, performance-based stock incentive plan (the
“2005 LTIP”) within the terms of our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan to provide incentive to our
executive officers and certain other key employees upon achievement of specified long-term business
objectives. In general, employees participating in the 2005 LTIP elect to receive a one-time award
of: (i) an option to acquire a specified number of shares priced at market value on the date of the
awards; (ii) rights to acquire for no additional consideration a specified smaller number of shares
of our Class A common stock; or (iii) a corresponding combination of a lesser number of option
shares and such rights to acquire our Class A common stock. The options and rights are subject to
certain performance criteria and vest over a seven year period at the rate of 10% per year during
the first four years, and at the rate of 20% per year thereafter.

Options to purchase 5.7 million shares pursuant
to a long-term incentive plan under our 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “1999 LTIP”), and 5.3 million shares pursuant to the 2005 LTIP were outstanding
as of December 31, 2006. These options were granted with exercise prices at least equal to the
market value of the underlying shares on the dates they were issued. The weighted-average exercise
price of these options is $8.80 under our 1999 LTIP and $29.78 under our 2005 LTIP. The
weighted-average fair value of the options granted during 2006 pursuant to the 2005 LTIP was
$15.43. Further, pursuant to the 2005 LTIP, there were also 725,298 outstanding Restricted
Performance Units as of December 31, 2006 with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $30.80.
Vesting of these options and Restricted Performance Units is contingent upon meeting certain
long-term goals which management has determined
are not probable as of December 31, 2006. Consequently, no compensation was recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2006 related to these long-term options and Restricted
Performance Units. In accordance with SFAS 123R, such compensation, if recorded, would
result in total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $138.0 million, of which $115.7
million relates to performance based options and $22.3 million relates to Restricted Performance
Units. This would be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period or expensed immediately,
if fully vested, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Cost of sales and operating expense categories included in our accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) do not include depreciation expense related to
satellites or equipment leased to customers.

Our Satellites

We presently transmit programming from 14 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300
miles above the equator. Of these 11 are owned and three are leased. Each of the owned satellites
had an original minimum useful life of at least 12 years. Two of the leased satellites are
accounted for as capital leases pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases” (“SFAS 13”) and are depreciated over the ten-year terms of the satellite
service agreements. Our satellite fleet is a major component of our EchoStar DBS System. While we
believe that overall our satellite fleet is generally in good condition, during 2006 and prior
periods, certain satellites in our fleet have experienced anomalies, some of which have had a
significant adverse impact on their commercial operation. We
currently do not carry insurance for any of our owned in-orbit
satellites. We believe we generally have in-orbit satellite
capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our
critical programming in the event one of our in-orbit satellites were
to fail. We could not, however,
recover certain local markets, international and other niche
programming in the event of such failure, with the extent of
disruption dependent on the specific satellite experiencing the
failure. Further, programming
continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses.

EchoStar I.

EchoStar I was launched during December 1995 and currently operates at the 148 degree
orbital location. The satellite can operate up to 16 transponders at 130 watts per channel.
During the second quarter of 2006, the satellite experienced anomalies resulting in the possible
loss of two solar array strings. An investigation of the anomalies is continuing. The anomalies
have not impacted commercial operation of the satellite to date. Even if permanent loss of the two
solar array strings is confirmed, the original minimum 12-year design life of the satellite is not
expected to be impacted since the satellite is equipped with a total of 104 solar array strings,
only approximately 98 of which are required to assure full power availability for the design life
of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact the remaining life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar II.

EchoStar II was launched during September 1996 and currently operates at the 148
degree orbital location. The satellite can operate up to 16 transponders at 130 watts per channel.
During February 2007, the satellite experienced an anomaly which prevented its north solar array
from rotating. Functionality was restored through a backup system. The design life of the
satellite has not been affected and the anomaly is not expected to result in the loss of power to
the satellite. However, if the backup system fails, a partial loss of power would result which
could impact the useful life or commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar III.

EchoStar III was launched during October 1997 and currently operates at the 61.5
degree orbital location. The satellite was originally designed to operate a maximum of 32
transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at
over 230 watts per channel, and was equipped with a total of 44 transponders to provide redundancy.
Prior to 2006, traveling wave tube amplifiers (“TWTA”) anomalies caused 22 transponders to fail.
During April and October 2006, further TWTA anomalies caused the failure of four additional
transponders. As a result, a maximum of 18 transponders are currently available for use on
EchoStar III, but due to redundancy switching limitations and specific channel authorizations, we
can only operate 15 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies we have the right to utilize at the 61.5
degree location. While we do not expect a large number of additional TWTAs to fail in any year,
and the failures have not reduced the original minimum 12-year design life of the satellite, it is
likely that additional TWTA failures will occur from time to time in the future, and those failures
will further impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar IV.

EchoStar IV was launched during May 1998 and currently operates at the 77 degree
orbital location, which is licensed by the government of Mexico to a
venture in which we hold a minority interest. The satellite was originally
designed to operate a maximum of 32 transponders at approximately 120 watts per channel, switchable
to 16 transponders operating at over 230 watts per channel. As a result of past TWTA failures,
only six transponders are currently available for use and the satellite

F-24


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

has been fully depreciated
on our books. There can be no assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use,
of EchoStar IV will not occur in the immediate future.

EchoStar V.

EchoStar V was launched during September 1999 and currently operates at the 129 degree
orbital location. The satellite was originally designed with a minimum 12-year design life. As
previously disclosed, momentum wheel failures in prior years, together with relocation of the
satellite between orbital locations, resulted in increased fuel consumption. These issues have not
impacted commercial operation of the satellite, but have reduced the remaining spacecraft life to
less than two years as of December 31, 2006. Prior to 2006, EchoStar V also experienced anomalies
resulting in the loss of six solar array strings. During July 2006, the satellite lost an
additional solar array string. The solar array anomalies have not impacted commercial operation of
the satellite to date. Since the satellite only has a remaining life of approximately two years,
the solar array failures (which would normally have resulted in a reduction in the number of
transponders to which power can be provided in later years), are not expected to reduce the current
remaining life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not
cause further losses which could impact commercial operation, or the remaining life, of the
satellite. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived Satellite Assets

” below.

EchoStar VI.

EchoStar VI was launched during July 2000 and is currently stationed at the 110
degree orbital location as an in-orbit spare. The satellite was originally equipped with 108 solar
array strings, approximately 102 of which are required to assure full power availability for the
original minimum 12-year design life of the satellite. Prior to 2006, EchoStar VI experienced
anomalies resulting in the loss of 15 solar array strings. During 2006, two additional solar array
strings failed, reducing the number of functional solar array strings to 91. While the design life
of the satellite has not been affected, commercial operability has been reduced. The satellite was
designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately 125 watts per channel, switchable to 16
transponders operating at approximately 225 watts per channel. The power reduction resulting from
the solar array failures limits us to operation of a maximum of 26 transponders in standard power
mode, or 13 transponders in high power mode currently. The number of transponders to which power
can be provided is expected to continue to decline in the future at the rate of approximately one
transponder every three years. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived Satellite
Assets

” below.

EchoStar VII.

EchoStar VII was launched during February 2002 and currently operates at the 119
degree orbital location. During March 2006, the satellite experienced an anomaly which resulted in
the loss of a receiver. Service was quickly restored through a spare receiver. These receivers
process signals sent from our uplink center, for transmission back to earth by the satellite. The
design life of the satellite has not been affected and the anomaly is not expected to result in the
loss of other receivers on the satellite. However, there can be no assurance future anomalies will
not cause further receiver losses which could impact the useful life or commercial operation of the
satellite. In the event the spare receiver placed in operation following the March 2006 anomaly
also fails, there would be no impact to the satellite’s ability to provide service to the
continental United States (“CONUS”) when operating in CONUS mode. However, we would lose one-fifth
of the spot beam capacity when operating in spot beam mode.

EchoStar VIII.

EchoStar VIII was launched during August 2002 and currently operates at the 110
degree orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 32 transponders at approximately
120 watts per channel, switchable to 16 transponders operating at approximately 240 watts per
channel. EchoStar VIII also includes spot-beam technology. As previously disclosed, the satellite
has experienced several anomalies since launch, but none have reduced the 12-year estimated useful
life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not cause
further losses which could materially impact its commercial operation, or result in a total loss of
the satellite.

We depend on EchoStar VIII to provide service to CONUS at least until such time as our EchoStar XI
satellite has commenced commercial operation, which is currently expected during the second half of
2008. AMC-14, which is expected to commence commercial operation in early 2008, also has the
capability to act as a backup for EchoStar VIII and could be launched to the 110 degree orbital
location, if necessary. In the event that EchoStar VIII experienced a total or substantial
failure, we could transmit many, but not all, of those channels from other in-orbit satellites.

F-25


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

EchoStar IX.

EchoStar IX was launched during August 2003 and currently operates at the 121 degree
orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 32 FSS transponders operating at
approximately 110 watts per channel, along with transponders that can provide services in the
Ka-Band (a “Ka-band payload”). EchoStar IX provides expanded video and audio channels to DISH
Network subscribers who install a specially-designed dish. The Ka-band spectrum is being used to
test and verify potential future broadband initiatives and to implement those services. The
satellite also includes a C-band payload which is owned by a third party. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, EchoStar IX experienced the loss of one of its three momentum wheels, two of which
are utilized during normal operations. A spare wheel was switched in at the time and the loss did
not reduce the 12-year estimated useful life of the satellite. However, there can be no assurance
future anomalies will not cause further losses, which could impact the remaining life or commercial
operation of the satellite.

EchoStar X

.

EchoStar X was launched during February 2006 and currently operates at the
110 degree orbital location. Its 49 spot beams use up to 42 active 140 watt TWTAs to provide
standard and HD local channels, and other programming, to markets across the United States. In the
event our EchoStar X satellite experienced a significant failure, we would lose the ability to
deliver local network channels in many markets. While we would attempt to minimize the number of
lost markets through the use of spare satellites and programming line up changes, some markets
would be without local channels until a replacement satellite with similar spot beam capability
could be launched and operational.

EchoStar XII.

EchoStar XII was launched during July 2003 and currently operates at the 61.5 degree
orbital location. The satellite was designed to operate 13 transponders at 270 watts per channel,
in CONUS mode, or 22 spot beams using a combination of 135 and 65 watt TWTAs. We currently operate
the satellite in CONUS mode. EchoStar XII has a total of 24 solar array circuits, approximately 22
of which are required to assure full power for the original minimum 12-year design life of the
satellite. Prior to 2006, two solar array circuits failed, one of which was subsequently restored
to partial use. During 2006, three additional solar array circuits failed. The cause of the
failures is being investigated. While the design life of the satellite has not been affected, in
future years the power loss will cause a reduction in the number of transponders which can be
operated. The exact extent of this impact has not yet been determined. There can be no assurance
future anomalies will not cause further losses, which could further impact commercial operation of
the satellite or its useful life. See discussion of evaluation of impairment in “

Long-Lived
Satellite Assets

” below.

Long-Lived Satellite Assets.

We account for impairments of long-lived satellite assets in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

” (“SFAS 144”). SFAS 144 requires a long-lived
asset or asset group to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance
indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Based on the guidance under SFAS 144, we
evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. While certain of the anomalies
discussed above, and previously disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse
change in the physical condition of an individual satellite, based on the redundancy designed
within each satellite and considering the asset grouping, these anomalies (none of which caused a
loss of service to subscribers for an extended period) are not considered to be significant events
that would require evaluation for impairment recognition pursuant to the guidance under SFAS 144.
Unless and until a specific satellite is abandoned or otherwise determined to have no service
potential, the net carrying amount related to the satellite would not be written off.

AMC-15.

We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the
capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten-year satellite service
agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us
with certain rights to replacement satellites.

AMC-16.

We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the
capacity on AMC 16, an FSS
satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten-year
satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term,
and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $551.6 million capitalized for the estimated fair value of
satellites acquired under capital leases included in “Property and equipment, net,” with related
accumulated depreciation of $108.5 million and $53.3 million, respectively. In our Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), we recognized $55.2 million and $53.3
million in depreciation expense on satellites acquired under capital lease agreements during the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2004, we did not recognize any
depreciation on the satellites acquired under these capital leases.

6. Income Taxes

As of December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”) for federal income tax
purposes of $1.641 billion and tax benefits related to credit
carryforwards of $41.9 million. We
have recorded in 2006, tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards of $26.3 million. The NOL’s begin
to expire in the year 2020 and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the year 2010.

F-32


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, as well as probable operating loss, tax credit and other carryforwards. We follow the
guidelines set forth in SFAS 109 regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. In accordance with SFAS
109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance. Determining necessary valuation
allowances requires us to make assessments about historical financial information as well as the
timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available
tax planning opportunities. During the second quarter of 2005, we concluded the recoverability of
certain of our deferred tax assets was more likely than not and accordingly reversed the portion of
the valuation allowance which was no longer required. As of December 31, 2006, there remains $4.0
million of valuation allowance which relates to deferred tax assets for credit carryforwards and
state income tax net operating losses which begin to expire in the year 2010.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Federal NOL includes amounts related to tax deductions for
exercised options that have been allocated directly to contributed capital for exercised stock
options totaling $284.1 million and $274.7 million, respectively.

Stock option compensation expenses for which an estimated deferred tax benefit was previously
recorded exceeded the actual tax deductions allowed during 2006 and 2005. Tax charges associated
with the reversal of the prior tax benefit have been reported in “Additional paid-in capital” in
accordance with APB 25 and SFAS 123R. During 2006 and 2005, charges of $0.9 million and $10.4
million, respectively, were made to additional paid-in capital.

Common Stock Repurchase Programs

During 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion
of our Class A common stock. As of July 15, 2004, we had completed this share repurchase plan,
having purchased a total of 31.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for a total of $1.0
billion.

During August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of up to an
additional $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock pursuant to a new repurchase plan. During 2006
and 2005, we purchased approximately 0.4 million and 13.2 million shares of our Class A common
stock for $11.7 million and $362.5 million, respectively. Our share repurchase program does not
require us to acquire any specific number or amount of securities and may be terminated at any
time.

Cash Dividend

During 2004, we paid a one-time cash dividend of $1.00 per share, or $455.7 million, on outstanding
shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.

8. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the
“ESPP”), effective beginning October 1, 1997. During 2006, this plan was amended for the purpose
of registering an additional 1,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and was approved by the
stockholders at our Annual Meeting held on May 11, 2006 by the requisite vote of stockholders.
Under the ESPP, we are now authorized to issue a total of 1,800,000 shares of Class A common stock.
Substantially all full-time employees who have been employed by us for at least one calendar
quarter are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Employee stock purchases are made through payroll
deductions. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees may not deduct an amount which would permit
such employee to purchase our capital stock under all of our stock purchase plans at a rate which
would exceed $25,000 in fair value of capital stock in any one year. The purchase price of the
stock is 85% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the last business day of each
calendar quarter in which such shares of Class A common stock are deemed sold to an employee under
the ESPP. The ESPP shall terminate upon the first to occur of (i) October 1, 2007 or (ii) the date
on which the ESPP is terminated by the Board of Directors. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 employees
purchased approximately 89,000, 97,000, and 78,000 shares of Class A common stock through the ESPP,
respectively.

401(k) Employee Savings Plan

We sponsor a 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for eligible employees. Voluntary
employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be matched 50% by us, subject to a maximum annual
contribution of $1,000 per employee. Forfeitures of unvested participant balances which are
retained by the 401(k) Plan may be used to fund matching and discretionary contributions. Expense
recognized related to matching 401(k) contributions, net of forfeitures, totaled $2.1 million and
$0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We did not recognize
any expense related to matching 401(k) contributions during the year ended December 31, 2004, as
401(k) Plan forfeitures were sufficient to fund all of the Company matching contributions.

We also may make an annual discretionary contribution to the plan with approval by our Board of
Directors, subject to the maximum deductible limit provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. These contributions may be made in cash or in our stock. Discretionary stock
contributions, net of forfeitures, were $17.8 million, $15.4 million and $12.8 million relating to
the 401(k) Plan years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Satellite-Related Obligations

Satellites under Construction.

We have
entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are
contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years. Future commitments related to these satellites are
included in the table above under “Satellite-related obligations” except where noted below.

•

During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is
expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second
half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider,
Sea Launch.

•

During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional
SSL Ka and/or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008
and 2009.

•

CMBStar, an S-band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of
2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and
contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that
satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory
entity to support the
development of satellite-delivered mobile video services in China.

•

During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV
which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this
satellite are not included in the table above.

Leased Satellites.

In addition to our lease of the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites (Note 5), we have
also entered into satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites discussed
below. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under
“Satellite-related obligations.”

•

We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in-orbit FSS satellite,
AMC-2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to
continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease.

•

An SES Americom DBS satellite (“AMC-14”) which is currently expected to launch during
late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a
future date. The initial ten-year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be
accounted for as a capital lease. The satellite is being equipped with transmit antennas
optimized for multiple orbital locations, providing greater backup flexibility in the event
certain other in-orbit satellites fail.

•

A Telesat FSS satellite (“Anik F3”) which is currently expected to launch during the
second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15-year period
following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3
satellite agreement as a capital lease.

F-37


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

•

A Canadian DBS satellite (“Ciel 2”) which is currently expected to launch during 2009
and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten-year
term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital
lease.

In certain circumstances the dates on which
we are obligated to make these payments could be
delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance
for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease
of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we
had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our
obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver
systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH
Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to
purchase programming content.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have also entered into numerous contracts to purchase
programming content whereby our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of
subscribers to which we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not
included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years.
Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our
subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Rent Expense

Total rent expense for operating leases approximated $69.2 million, $67.6 million and $59.1 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now have and may in the future obtain patents and
other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services directly or indirectly
related to those that we offer. We may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property
rights that our products may potentially infringe. Damages in patent infringement cases can
include a tripling of actual damages in certain cases. Further, we cannot estimate the extent to
which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others
and the availability and cost of any such licenses. Various parties have asserted patent and other
intellectual property rights with respect to components within our direct broadcast satellite
system. We cannot be certain that these persons do not own the rights they claim, that our
products do not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these
persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we
would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

Contingencies

Distant Network Litigation

On October 20, 2006, a District Court in Florida entered a permanent nationwide injunction
prohibiting us from offering distant network channels to consumers effective December 1, 2006.
Distant networks are ABC, NBC, CBS
and Fox network channels which originate outside the community where the consumer who wants to view
them, lives. We have turned off all of our distant network channels and are no longer in the
distant network business. Termination of these channels resulted in, among other things, a small
reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and free cash flow, and a temporary increase in
subscriber churn. The plaintiffs in that litigation allege

F-38


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

that we are in violation of the Court’s
injunction and have appealed a District Court decision finding that we are not in violation. We
cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of that appeal.

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) filed suit against us, DirecTV, Thomson and others in
the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division,
alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,038,211 (the ‘211 patent), 5,293,357 (the ‘357
patent) and 4,751,578 (the ‘578 patent) which relate to certain electronic program guide functions,
including the use of electronic program guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and
declaratory relief and damages in an unspecified amount.

On summary judgment, the District Court ruled that none of the asserted patents were infringed by
us. These rulings were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
During 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court’s
findings and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. In 2005,
SuperGuide indicated that it would no longer pursue infringement allegations with respect to the
‘211 and ‘357 patents and those patents have now been dismissed from the suit. The District Court
subsequently entered judgment of non-infringement in favor of all defendants as to the ‘211 and
‘357 patents and ordered briefing on Thomson’s license defense as to the ‘578 patent. During
December 2006, the District Court found that there were disputed issues of fact regarding Thomson’s
license defense, and ordered a trial solely addressed to that issue for March 2007. We also
requested leave to add a license defense as to the ‘578 patent in view of a new (at the time)
license we obtained from a third-party licensed by Superguide. Activity in the case as to us is
suspended pending resolution of the Thomson license defense issue.

We examined the ‘578 patent and believe that it is not infringed by any of our products or
services. We will continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain
user-friendly electronic programming guide and related features that we currently offer to
consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C.

In 2001, Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. (“Broadcast Innovation”) filed a lawsuit against us, DirecTV,
Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (the ‘094 patent) and 4,992,066 (the
‘066 patent). The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and
receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data. The ‘066 patent relates to
certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling circuitry for a pay television system on
removable cards. We examined these patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our
products or services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation leaving
us as the only defendant.

During 2004, the judge issued an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid. Also in 2004, the Court
ruled the ‘094 invalid in a parallel case filed by Broadcast Innovation against Charter and
Comcast. In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) overturned
this finding of invalidity and remanded the case back to the District Court. During June 2006,
Charter filed a reexamination request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The
Court has stayed the case pending reexamination. Our case remains stayed pending resolution of the
Charter case.

We intend to continue to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain
user-friendly features that we currently offer to

consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of
certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Tivo Inc.

During April 2006, a Texas jury concluded that certain of our digital video recorders, or DVRs,
infringed a patent held by Tivo. The Texas court subsequently issued an injunction prohibiting us
from offering DVR functionality. A Court of Appeals has stayed that injunction during the pendency
of our appeal.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“SFAS 5”), we recorded a total reserve of $94.0 million in “Tivo litigation expense” on our
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect the jury verdict, supplemental damages
and pre-judgment interest awarded by the Texas court through September 8, 2006. Based on our
current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is
more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, we are not recording additional
amounts for supplemental damages or interest subsequent to the September 8, 2006 judgment date. If
the verdict is upheld on appeal, the $94.0 million amount would increase by approximately
$35.0 million through 2007.

If the verdict is upheld on appeal and we are not able to successfully implement alternative
technology (including the successful defense of any challenge that such technology infringes Tivo’s
patent), we would owe substantial additional damages and we could also be prohibited from
distributing DVRs, or be required to modify or eliminate certain user-friendly DVR features that we
currently offer to consumers. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our
competitors who could offer this functionality and, while we would attempt to provide that
functionality through other manufacturers, the adverse affect on our business could be material.

Acacia

In June 2004, Acacia Media Technologies (“Acacia”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit also named DirecTV, Comcast,
Charter, Cox and a number of smaller cable companies as defendants. Acacia is an intellectual
property holding company which seeks to license the patent portfolio that it has acquired. The
suit alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,132,992 (the ‘992 patent), 5,253,275 (the
‘275 patent), 5,550,863 (the ‘863 patent), 6,002,720 (the ‘720 patent) and 6,144,702 (the ‘702
patent). The ‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘702 patents have been asserted against us.

The patents relate to various systems and methods related to the transmission of digital data. The
‘992 and ‘702 patents have also been asserted against several Internet content providers in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. During 2004 and 2005, the
Court issued Markman rulings which found that the ‘992 and ‘702 patents were not as broad as Acacia
had contended, and that certain terms in the ‘702 patent were indefinite. During April 2006,
EchoStar and other defendants asked the Court to rule that the claims of the ‘702 patent are
invalid and not infringed. That motion is pending. In June and September 2006, the Court held
Markman hearings on the ‘992, ‘863, ‘720 and ‘275 patents, and issued a ruling during December
2006. We believe the decision is generally favorable to us, but we can not predict whether it will
result in dismissal of the case.

Acacia’s various patent infringement cases have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We intend to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the
patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an
injunction that could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the
suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Forgent

In July 2005, Forgent Networks, Inc. (“Forgent”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The suit also named DirecTV, Charter, Comcast,
Time Warner Cable, Cable One and Cox as defendants. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent No. 6,285,746 (the ‘746 patent).

The ‘746 patent discloses a video teleconferencing system which utilizes digital telephone lines.
We have examined this patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately
determines that we infringe this patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may
include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain
user-friendly features that we currently offer to consumers. Trial is currently scheduled for May
2007 in Tyler, Texas. On October 2, 2006, the Patent and Trademark Office granted our petition for
reexamination of the ‘746 patent. On October 27, 2006, the Patent and Trademark Office issued its
initial office action rejecting all of the claims of the ‘746 patent in light of several prior art
references. Forgent will have an opportunity to challenge the initial office action. We cannot
predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

Finisar Corporation

Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) recently obtained a $100.0 million verdict in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against DirecTV for patent infringement. Finisar
alleged that DirecTV’s electronic program guide and other elements of its system infringe United
States Patent No. 5,404,505 (the ‘505 patent).

On July 10, 2006, we, together with NagraStar LLC, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Finisar that asks the Court
to declare that they and we do not infringe, and have not infringed, any valid claim of the ‘505
patent. Trial is not currently scheduled. We intend to vigorously defend our rights in this
action. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we may be
subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that could
require us to modify our system architecture. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the
outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Trans Video

In August 2006, Trans Video Electronic, Ltd. (“Trans Video”) filed a patent infringement action
against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit
alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,903,621 (the ‘621 patent) and 5,991,801 (the
‘801 patent). The patents relate to various methods related to the transmission of digital data by
satellite. Trial has been set for July 2008. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the
event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe any of the patents, we may be subject to
substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction. We cannot predict with
any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability
or damages.

Retailer Class Actions

During 2000, lawsuits were filed by retailers in Colorado state and federal court attempting to
certify nationwide classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The
plaintiffs are requesting the Courts declare certain provisions of, and changes to, alleged
agreements between us and the retailers invalid and unenforceable, and to award damages for lost
incentives and payments, charge backs, and other compensation. We are vigorously defending against
the suits and have asserted a variety of counterclaims. The federal court action has been stayed
during the pendency of the state court action. We filed a motion for summary judgment on all
counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a motion for additional time to conduct
discovery to enable them to respond to our motion. The Court granted limited discovery which ended
during 2004. The plaintiffs claimed we did not provide adequate disclosure during the discovery
process. The Court agreed, and recently denied our motion for summary judgment as a result. A
trial date

cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any
potential liability or damages.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment

During October 2001, we received approximately $40.0 million from the sale of Enron commercial
paper to a third party broker. That commercial paper was ultimately purchased by Enron. During
November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York, against approximately 100 defendants, including us, who invested in Enron’s
commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 purchase of its commercial paper
was a fraudulent conveyance and voidable preference under bankruptcy laws. We dispute these
allegations. We typically invest in commercial paper and notes which are rated in one of the four
highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
At the time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was considered to be high quality and
low risk. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the
extent of any potential liability or damages.

Riyad Alshuaibi

During 2002, Riyad Alshuaibi filed suit against Michael Kelly, one of our executive officers, Kelly
Broadcasting Systems, Inc. (“KBS”), and EchoStar in the District Court of New Jersey. Plaintiff
alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, and unjust enrichment
resulting in damages in excess of $50.0 million. We denied the allegations of plaintiff’s
complaint. On October 26, 2006, we reached a settlement which did not have a material impact on
our results of operations.

Other

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability
with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

10. Segment Reporting

Financial Data by Business Unit

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information” (“SFAS 131”) establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments in annual financial statements of public business enterprises and requires that
those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports
issued to stockholders. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker(s)
of an enterprise. Total assets by segment have not been specified
because the information is not available to the chief operating
decision-maker. Under this definition we currently operate as two business units. The All Other
category consists of revenue, expenses and net income (loss) from other operating segments for
which the disclosure requirements of SFAS 131 do not apply.

ability to significantly influence its operating policies, we accounted for our investment in
NagraStar under the equity method of accounting for all periods

presented. During the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we purchased security access devices from NagraStar of
$55.8 million, $121.4 million and $123.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
amounts payable to NagraStar totaled $3.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Additionally, as
of December 31, 2006, we were committed to purchase $35.5 million of security access devices from
NagraStar.

14. Subsequent Events

On February 21, 2007, we announced a $40.0 million investment in TU Media Corp.,
a Korean provider of satellite-delivered mobile video services.

During
February 2007, we began participating in an FCC Auction for licenses
in the 1.4 GHz band. Through February 26, 2007, we were the
provisional winning bidder for licenses totaling approximately
$52.0 million and we may continue to bid on the licenses
available in the Auction through its conclusion.
