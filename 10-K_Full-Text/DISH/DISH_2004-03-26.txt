PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Our Business

Echostar Communications Corporation, through its DISH Network, is a leading
provider of satellite delivered digital television to customers across the
United States. DISH Network services include hundreds of video, audio and data
channels, interactive television channels, digital video recording, high
definition television (“HDTV”), international programming, professional
installation and 24-hour customer service.

We started offering subscription television services on the DISH Network in
March 1996. As of December 31, 2003, the DISH Network had approximately 9.425
million subscribers. We currently have nine in-orbit satellites which enable us
to offer over 1,000 video and audio channels to consumers across the United
States. Since we use many of these channels for local programming, no
particular consumer could subscribe to all channels, but all are available
using small consumer dishes. We believe that the DISH Network offers
programming packages that have a better “price-to-value” relationship than
packages currently offered by most other subscription television providers. As
of December 31, 2003, there were over 22.0 million subscribers to direct
broadcast satellite and other direct-to-home satellite services in the United
States. We believe that there are more than 94.0 million pay television
subscribers in the United States, and there continues to be significant
unsatisfied demand for high quality, reasonably priced television programming
services.

DISH Network and EchoStar Technologies Corporation

The operations of EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC,” and together with
its subsidiaries, “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) include
two interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k – which provides a direct broadcast satellite
subscription television service we refer to as “DBS” in the United
States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”) – which designs and
develops DBS set-top boxes, antennae and other digital equipment for the
DISH Network. We refer to this equipment collectively as “EchoStar
receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and distributes similar
equipment for international satellite service providers.

Since 1994, we have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS
System.” The EchoStar DBS System consists of our FCC-allocated DBS spectrum,
nine in-orbit satellites (“EchoStar I” through “EchoStar IX”), EchoStar
receiver systems, digital broadcast operations centers, customer service
facilities, and other assets utilized in our operations. Our principal
business strategy is to continue developing our subscription television service
in the United States to provide consumers with a fully competitive alternative
to cable television service.

Other Information

We were organized in 1995 as a corporation under the laws of the State of
Nevada. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol “DISH”. Our principal executive offices are located at 9601
South Meridian Boulevard, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and our telephone number is
(303) 723-1000.

Recent Developments

Gemstar-TV Guide International transaction

.

On March 2, 2004, we announced a
long-term patent license and distribution agreement with Gemstar-TV Guide
International, Inc. This transaction includes a one-time cash payment by us of
$190.0 million for use of Gemstar intellectual property and technology, use of
the TV Guide brand on our interactive program guides, and for distribution
arrangements with Gemstar to provide for the launch and



carriage of the TV Guide Channel as well as the extension of an existing
distribution agreement for carriage of the TVG Network. We also signed an
agreement to resolve all outstanding litigation between us and Gemstar.

Also on March 2, 2004, we announced an agreement to acquire Gemstar’s
Superstar/Netlink Group LLC (“SNG”), UVTV distribution, and SpaceCom businesses
and related assets for approximately $48.0 million in cash. Our purchase of
these businesses is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary
conditions. The effectiveness of the patent license, distribution agreements
and settlement agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the
closing of the SNG sale.

Repurchase and Redemption of the 9 3/8% Senior Notes

.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, EDBS repurchased in open market transactions approximately $201.6
million of the original $1.625 billion principal amount of its 9 3/8% Senior
Notes due 2009. The difference between the market price paid and the principal
amount of approximately $12.7 million and unamortized debt issuance costs
related to the repurchased notes of approximately $1.6 million were recorded as
charges to earnings during the fourth quarter of 2003. Effective February 2,
2004, EDBS redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion principal amount of the notes
at 104.688%, for a total of approximately $1.490 billion. The premium paid of
approximately $66.7 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of
approximately $10.8 million were recorded as charges to earnings in February
2004.

DISH NETWORK

Programming

Programming Packages

.

We use a “value-based” strategy in structuring the
content and pricing of programming packages available from the DISH Network.
For example, we currently sell our entry-level “America’s Top 60” programming
package to consumers in digital format for $24.99 per month. This programming
package includes 60 of the most popular video channels. Satellite-delivered
local channels are currently available separately for an additional $5.99 per
month in 110 of the largest markets in the United States, representing over 85%
of all of U.S. television households. We estimate cable operators charge over
$35 per month, on average, for their entry-level expanded basic service that
typically consists of approximately 55 analog channels, including local
channels. We believe that our “America’s Top 120” programming package, which is
similar to an expanded basic cable package plus a digital music service and
which we currently sell for $34.99 per month, also compares favorably to
similar cable television programming. Based on cable industry statistics, we
estimate that cable operators would typically charge as much as $45.00 per
month for a similar package, including local channels. In addition to the
above mentioned programming packages, we also offer our “America’s Top 180”
programming package for $44.99 per month and our “America’s Everything Pak”,
which combines our “America’s Top 180” programming package and all four movie
packages, which are discussed below, for $77.99 per month. Certain of our
current new subscriber promotions include local programming in the qualifying
programming packages for no additional fee.

Movie Packages

.

We currently offer each of our four movie packages, which
include up to 10 movie channels per package, starting at $11.99 per month. We
believe we currently offer more movie channels than cable typically offers at a
comparable price.

DISH Latino Programming Packages

.

We also offer Spanish-language programming
packages. For example, we believe that our “DISH Latino” package, which
includes more than 30 Spanish-language programming channels for $24.99 per
month, is one of the most attractive Spanish-language packages available in the
United States. We also offer “DISH Latino Dos,” which includes 120 English and
Spanish-language programming channels for $34.99 per month. Additionally, we
offer DISH Latino Max with more than 160 Spanish and English-language channels
for $44.99 per month.

International Programming

.

Currently, we offer approximately 60
foreign-language channels including Arabic, South Asian, Hindi, Russian,
Chinese, Greek and many others. DISH Network remains the pay-TV leader in
delivering foreign-language programming to customers in the United States at
superior values. We believe foreign-language programming is a valuable niche
product that attracts a number of new subscribers who are unable to get similar
programming elsewhere.



Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Sales Channels

.

Independent distributors, retailers and consumer electronics
stores currently sell EchoStar receiver systems and solicit orders for DISH
Network programming services. While we also sell receiver systems and
programming directly, independent retailers are responsible for most of our
sales. These independent retailers are primarily local retailers who
specialize in TV and home entertainment systems. We also sell EchoStar
receiver systems through nationwide retailers such as Costco, Sears and
Wal-Mart, and certain regional consumer electronic chains. In addition,
RadioShack Corporation sells EchoStar receiver systems and DISH Network
programming services through its 5,200 corporate stores and in approximately
1,000 dealer franchise stores nationwide.

We currently have an agreement with JVC to distribute our receiver systems
under its label through certain of its nationwide retailers, and an agreement
with Thomson multimedia, Inc. to distribute our receiver systems under the
EchoStar and RCA label through certain of its nationwide retailers.

We offer our distributors and retailers what we believe are competitive
incentive programs. Through these programs, qualified distributors and
retailers receive, among other things, commissions upon new subscriber
activations and monthly residual incentives dependent, among other things, on
continued consumer subscription to qualified programming.

Marketing

.

We use regional and national broadcast and print advertising to
promote the DISH Network. We also offer point-of-sale literature, product
displays, demonstration kiosks and signage for retail outlets. We provide
guides that describe DISH Network products and services to our retailers and
distributors at nationwide educational seminars and directly by mail. Our
mobile sales and marketing team visits retail outlets regularly to reinforce
training and ensure that these outlets quickly fulfill point-of-sale needs.
Additionally, we dedicate a DISH Network channel and provide a retailer
specific website to provide information about special services and promotions
that we offer from time to time.

Promotional Subsidies

.

Our future success in the subscription television
industry depends on, among other factors, our ability to acquire and retain
DISH Network subscribers. We provide varying levels of subsidies and
incentives to attract customers, including free or subsidized receiver systems,
installations, antenna, programming and other items. This marketing strategy
emphasizes our long-term business strategy of maximizing future revenue by
selling DISH Network programming to a large potential subscriber base and
rapidly increasing our subscriber base. Since we subsidize consumer up-front
costs, we incur significant costs each time we acquire a new subscriber.
Although there can be no assurance, we believe that on average we will be able
to fully recoup the up-front costs of subscriber acquisition from future
subscription television services revenue.

During July 2000, we began offering our DISH Network subscribers the option to
lease receiver systems. Our current equipment lease promotion, the Digital
Home Advantage program, offers consumers the ability to lease up to three
receiver systems and connect up to four televisions with one of several
qualifying programming packages starting at $29.99 per month, including local
programming, where available. We expect this marketing strategy will reduce
the cost of acquiring future subscribers because we retain ownership of the
receiver systems. Upon termination of service, Digital Home Advantage
subscribers are required to return the receiver and certain other equipment to
us. While we do not recover all of the equipment upon termination of service,
equipment that is recovered after deactivation is reconditioned and re-deployed
at a much lower cost than new equipment.

We base our marketing promotions, among other things, on current competitive
conditions. In some cases, if competition increases, or we determine for any
other reason that it is necessary to increase our subscriber acquisition costs
to attract new customers, our profitability and costs of operation would be
adversely affected.



Digital Video Recording and Interactive Services

We continue to expand our offerings to include interactive services. DISH
Network customers can also purchase or lease receivers with built-in hard disk
drives that permit viewers to pause and record live programs without the need
for videotape. We now offer receivers capable of storing up to 180 hours of
programming and expect to increase storage capacity on future receiver models.
We also currently offer receivers that provide a wide variety of innovative
interactive television services and applications.

Broadband Strategic Alliances

Since 2002, we have entered into agreements to combine DISH Network satellite
television service with the Internet access capabilities and, in certain
instances, the communications services of Earthlink, Qwest Communications
International Inc. and Sprint to offer bundled service packages to consumers.

During July 2003, we announced an agreement with SBC to co-brand our DISH
Network service with SBC’s telephony, high-speed data and other communications
services. SBC Communications is marketing the bundled service, which became
available to consumers in early 2004, and is responsible for integrated
order-entry, customer service and billing.

SBC purchases set-top box equipment from us to sell to bundled service
customers. SBC also outsources installation and certain customer service
functions to us for a fee. As part of the agreement, SBC will pay us certain
development and implementation fees.

Satellites

Overview of Our Satellites and FCC Authorizations

.

We presently have nine
satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator.
Each of our satellites has a minimum design life of 12 years and is equipped
to operate as follows:



Our satellites are located in orbital positions, or slots, that are designated
by their western longitude. An orbital position describes both a physical
location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band. The
FCC has divided each DBS orbital position into 32 frequency channels. Each
transponder on our satellites can exploit one frequency channel. Through
digital compression technology, we can currently transmit between nine and
eleven digital video channels from each transponder, on average. The FCC
licensed us to operate 96 direct broadcast satellite frequencies at various
orbital positions including:

•

21 frequencies at the 119 degree orbital location and
29 frequencies at the 110 degree orbital location, both capable
of providing service to the entire continental United States;

•

11 frequencies at the 61.5 degree orbital location,
capable of providing service to the Eastern and Central United
States;

•

32 frequencies at the 148 degree orbital location,
capable of providing service to the Western United States;

•

3 frequencies at the 157 degree orbital location,
capable of providing service to the Western United States.

We currently broadcast the majority of our programming from the 110 and 119
degree locations. The majority of our customers have satellite receiver
systems that are equipped to receive signals from both of these locations.

Satellite Anomalies

.

EchoStar I and EchoStar II are both Series 7000 class
satellites designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation. While
both of those satellites are currently functioning properly in orbit, a similar
Lockheed Series 7000 class satellite owned by Loral Skynet recently experienced
total in-orbit failure. While we currently do not have sufficient information
available to reach any conclusions as to whether other satellites of the Series
7000 class might be at increased risk of suffering a similar malfunction, no
telemetry or other data indicates EchoStar I or EchoStar II would be expected
to experience a similar failure. During December 2003, a spare Traveling Wave
Tube Amplifier (“TWTA”) was switched in to support operations on transponder 25
on EchoStar I due to degraded operation of the primary TWTA. There are a total
of 23 remaining TWTA’s available to support the 16 operational transponders on
EchoStar I. During 2003, one of the spare TWTA’s on EchoStar II which had been
found to be suspect during original In Orbit Test Operations in 1996 was
declared failed. There are a total of 23 remaining TWTA’s available to support
the 16 operational transponders on EchoStar II. EchoStar I and II are
currently located at the 148 west orbital location.

During January 2004, a TWTA pair on EchoStar III failed, resulting in a loss of
service on one of our licensed transponders. Including the seven TWTA pairs
that malfunctioned in prior years, these anomalies have resulted in the failure
of a total of 16 TWTA’s on the satellite to date. While originally designed to
operate a maximum of 32 transponders at any given time, the satellite was
equipped with a total of 44 TWTA’s to provide redundancy. EchoStar III can now
operate a maximum of 28 transponders but due to redundancy switching
limitations and the specific channel authorizations, currently it can only
operate on 17 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies at the 61.5 degree west
orbital location.

During 2000, 2001 and 2002, EchoStar V experienced anomalies resulting in the
loss of three solar array strings, and during January 2003, EchoStar V
experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array
string. The satellite has a total of approximately 96 solar array strings and
approximately 92 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year design life of the satellite. In addition, during January
2003, EchoStar V experienced an anomaly in a spacecraft electronic component
which affects the ability to receive telemetry from certain on-board equipment.
Other methods of communication have been established to alleviate the effects
of the failed component. An investigation of the solar array and electronic
component anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the
satellite, is continuing. In July 2001, EchoStar V experienced the loss of one
of its three momentum wheels. Two momentum wheels are utilized during normal
operations and a spare wheel was switched in at the time. A second momentum
wheel experienced an anomaly in December 2003 and was switched out resulting in
operation of the spacecraft in a modified mode utilizing thrusters to maintain
spacecraft pointing. While this operating mode provides adequate performance,
it results in an increase in fuel usage and a corresponding reduction of
spacecraft life. This operating mode is not expected to reduce the estimated
design life of the satellite to less than 12 years.



The investigation into the anomaly is continuing. Until the root causes of
these anomalies are finally determined, there can be no assurance future
anomalies will not cause further losses which could impact commercial operation
of the satellite.

During 2002, two of the thrusters on EchoStar VIII experienced anomalous events
and are not currently in use. During March 2003, an additional thruster on
EchoStar VIII experienced an anomalous event and is not currently in use. The
satellite is equipped with a total of 12 thrusters that help control spacecraft
location, attitude, and pointing and is currently operating using a combination
of the other nine thrusters. This workaround requires more frequent maneuvers
to maintain the satellite at its specified orbital location, which are less
efficient and therefore result in accelerated fuel use. In addition, the
workaround has resulted in certain gyroscopes being utilized for aggregate
periods of time substantially in excess of their originally qualified limits.
However, neither of these workarounds are expected to reduce the estimated
design life of the satellite to less than 12 years. An investigation of the
thruster anomalies, including the development of additional workarounds for
long term operations, is continuing. None of these events has impacted
commercial operation of the satellite to date. Until the root cause of these
anomalies has been finally determined, there can be no assurance that these or
future anomalies will not cause further losses which could impact commercial
operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VIII is equipped with two solar arrays which convert solar energy into
power for the satellite. Those arrays rotate continuously to maintain optimal
exposure to the sun. During June and July 2003, EchoStar VIII experienced
anomalies that temporarily halted rotation of one of the solar arrays. In
December 2003 the other array experienced a similar anomaly. Both arrays are
currently fully functional, but rotating in a mode recommended by the satellite
manufacturer which allows full rotation but is different than the originally
prescribed mode. An investigation of the solar array anomalies, none of which
have impacted commercial operation of the satellite, is continuing. Until the
root cause of these anomalies is finally determined, there can be no assurance
future anomalies will not cause losses which could impact commercial operation
of the satellite.

During September 2003, a single battery cell on EchoStar VIII exhibited reduced
capacity. There are 72 battery cells on EchoStar VIII and all loads can be
maintained for the full design life of the satellite with up to two battery
cells fully failed. An investigation of the battery cell anomaly, which has
not impacted commercial operation of the satellite, is underway. Until the
root cause of the anomaly is determined, there can be no assurance future
anomalies will not cause losses which could impact commercial operation of the
satellite.

Satellite Insurance

.

We currently do not carry launch and/or in-orbit
insurance for any of our nine in-orbit satellites. To satisfy insurance
covenants related to EDBS’ senior notes, we have reclassified an amount equal
to the depreciated cost of five of our satellites from cash and cash
equivalents to cash reserved for satellite insurance on our balance sheet. As
of December 31, 2003, cash reserved for satellite insurance totaled
approximately $176.8 million. Effective February 2, 2004, as a result of the
redemption of EDBS’ 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009, our obligation to reserve for
satellite insurance declined to the depreciated cost of three of our
satellites. As an indirect result of this redemption, during February 2004, we
were able to reduce our reserve and reclassify approximately $57.2 million,
representing the depreciated cost of two of our satellites, from cash reserved
for satellite insurance to cash and cash equivalents. We will continue to
reserve cash for satellite insurance on our balance sheet until such time, if
ever, as we can again insure our satellites on acceptable terms and for
acceptable amounts, or until the indenture covenants requiring the insurance
are no longer applicable.

We believe we have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to expeditiously
recover transmission of most programming in the event one of our in-orbit
satellites fails. However, the cash reserved for satellite insurance is not
adequate to fund the construction, launch and insurance for a replacement
satellite in the event of a complete loss of a satellite. Programming
continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses.

In September 1998, we filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a total loss
under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The insurance
carriers offered us a total of approximately $88.0 million, or 40% of the total
policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance claim. We are
currently in arbitration with the insurers regarding this claim. See “Item 3 –
Legal Proceedings.”



Certain Other Risks to Our Satellites

.

Meteoroid events pose a potential threat
to all in-orbit geosynchronous satellites including our DBS satellites. While
the probability that our satellites will be damaged by meteoroids is very
small, that probability increases significantly when the Earth passes through
the particulate stream left behind by various comets.

Occasionally, increased solar activity poses a potential threat to all in-orbit
geosynchronous satellites including our direct broadcast satellites. The
probability that the effects from this activity will damage our satellites or
cause service interruptions is generally very small.

Some decommissioned spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits which pass through
the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to operational
spacecraft including our direct broadcast satellites. The locations of these
hazards are generally well known and may require us to perform maneuvers to
avoid collisions.

Satellites under Construction and Leased Satellites

.

EchoStar X, which is
expected to be launched during 2005, is being built by Lockheed Martin
Commercial Space Systems and will be used for expanded DISH Network video
services.

During March 2003 we entered into a satellite service agreement with SES
Americom for all of the capacity on a new FSS satellite, which may be located
at the 105 degree orbital location or certain other orbital locations. We also
agreed to lease all of the capacity on an existing in-orbit FSS satellite at
the 105 degree orbital location beginning August 1, 2003 and continuing at
least until the new satellite is launched. We intend to use the capacity on
the satellites to offer a combination of programming including local network
channels in additional markets, together with satellite-delivered, high-speed
internet services. During August 2003, we exercised our option under the SES
Americom agreement to also lease for an initial ten-year term all of the
capacity on a new DBS satellite at an orbital location to be determined at a
future date. We anticipate that this satellite will be launched during the
fourth quarter of 2005.

During February 2004, we entered into two additional satellite service
agreements for capacity on FSS satellites. Pending the successful launch and
entry into service of the previously described new FSS satellite, the satellite
under the first of these agreements is scheduled for launch during the first
half of 2005. We intend to use this additional satellite as backup in the case
of any unexpected events related to the initial operational deployment of the
satellite at the 105 degree orbital location, and may also utilize the
satellite to offer local network channels in additional markets, together with
satellite-delivered, high-speed internet services. The satellite under the
second of these agreements is planned for launch during the second half of 2006
and is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary regulatory
approvals. There can be no assurance that we will obtain these approvals or
that the satellite will ultimately be launched. It is our intent to use the
capacity on this satellite to offer additional value-added services.

Components of a DBS System

Overview

.

In order to provide programming services to DISH Network subscribers,
we have entered into agreements with video, audio and data programmers, who
deliver their programming content to our digital broadcast operations centers
in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona, via commercial satellites, fiber
optic networks or microwave transmissions. We monitor those signals for
quality, and can add promotional messages, public service programming,
advertising, and other information. Equipment at our digital broadcast
operations centers then digitizes, compresses, encrypts and combines the signal
with other necessary data, such as conditional access information. We then
“uplink” or transmit the signals to one or more of our satellites and broadcast
directly to DISH Network subscribers.



In order to receive DISH Network programming, a subscriber needs:

•   a satellite antenna, which people sometimes refer to as a “dish,” and related components;

•   a “satellite receiver” or “set-top box”; and

•   a television set.

EchoStar Receiver Systems

.

EchoStar receiver systems include a small satellite
dish, a digital satellite receiver that decrypts and decompresses signals for
television viewing, a remote control, and other related components. We offer a
number of set-top box models. Our standard system comes with an infrared
universal remote control, an on-screen interactive program guide and V-chip
type technology for parental control. Our premium models include a hard disk
drive enabling additional features such as digital video recording of up to 180
hours of programming, a UHF/infrared universal remote, and an expansion port
for future upgradeability. Certain of our standard and premium systems allow
independent satellite TV viewing on two separate televisions. We also offer a
variety of specialized products including HDTV receivers. Set-top boxes
communicate with our authorization center through telephone lines to, among
other things, report the purchase of pay-per-view movies and other events.
DISH Network reception equipment is incompatible with competitors’ systems.

Although we internally design and engineer our receiver systems, we outsource
manufacturing to high-volume contract electronics manufacturers. Sanmina-SCI
Corporation (formerly known as SCI Systems, Inc.) is the primary manufacturer
of our receiver systems. JVC also manufactures some of our receiver systems.
In addition, during 2002, we signed manufacturing agreements with RCA/Thomson
and Celetron USA, Inc.

Conditional Access System

.

We use conditional access technology to encrypt our
programming so only those who pay can receive it. We use microchips embedded
in credit card-sized access cards, or “smart cards” to control access to
authorized programming content. ECC owns 50% of NagraStar LLC, a joint venture
that provides us with smart cards. Nagra USA owns the other 50% of NagraStar.
NagraStar purchases these smart cards from NagraCard SA, a Swiss company which
is an affiliate of Nagra USA. These smart cards, which we can update or
replace periodically, are a key element in preserving the security of our
conditional access system. When a consumer orders a particular channel, we
send a message by satellite that instructs the smart card to permit decryption
of the programming for viewing by that consumer. The set-top box then
decompresses the programming and sends it to the consumer’s television.

Theft of subscription television programming has been widely reported and our
signal encryption has been pirated and could be further compromised in the
future. Theft of our programming reduces future potential revenue and increases
our net subscriber acquisition costs. In addition, theft of our competitors’
programming can also increase our churn. Compromises of our encryption
technology could also adversely affect our ability to contract for video and
audio services provided by programmers. It is illegal to create, sell or
otherwise distribute mechanisms or devices to circumvent that encryption. We
continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security
measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. In
order to combat piracy and maintain the functionality of active set-top boxes
that have been sold to subscribers, we intend to replace older generation smart
cards with newer generation smart cards in the future. However, there can be
no assurance that these security measures or any future security measures we
may implement will be effective in reducing piracy of our programming signals.

Installation

.

While many consumers have the skills necessary to install our
equipment in their homes, we believe that most installations are best performed
by professionals, and that on time, quality installations are important to our
success. Consequently, we have expanded our installation business, which is
conducted through our DISH Network Service LLC subsidiary. We use both
employees and independent contractors for professional installations.
Independent installers are held to DISH Network Service LLC service standards
to attempt to ensure each DISH Network customer receives the same quality
installation and service. Our offices and independent installers are
strategically located throughout the continental United States. Although there
can be no assurance, we believe that our internal installation business helps
to improve quality control, decrease wait time on service calls and new
installations and helps us better accommodate anticipated subscriber growth.



Digital Broadcast Operations Centers

.

Our principal digital broadcast
operations center is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. We also own a digital
broadcast operations center in Gilbert, Arizona which we use as back up to our
main facility located in Cheyenne and to support the increase in the number of
markets in which we offer local network channels by satellite. Almost all of
the functions necessary to provide satellite-delivered services occur at the
digital broadcast operations centers. The digital broadcast operations centers
use fiber optic lines and downlink antennas to receive programming and other
data. These centers then uplink programming content to our direct broadcast
satellites. Equipment at our digital broadcast operations centers performs
substantially all compression and encryption of DISH Network’s programming
signals.

Customer Service Centers

.

We currently own or operate nine customer service
centers fielding substantially all of our customer service calls. Potential
and existing subscribers can call a single telephone number to receive
assistance for hardware, programming, billing, installation and technical
support. We continue to work to automate simple phone responses and to
increase Internet-based customer assistance in order to better manage customer
service costs.

Subscriber Management

.

We presently use, and are dependent on, CSG Systems
International Inc.’s software system for the majority of DISH Network
subscriber billing and related functions.

Competition for Our Dish Network Business

We compete in the subscription television service industry against other
satellite, cable television and land-based system operators offering video,
audio and data programming and entertainment services. Many of these
competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources
than we have. Our ability to increase earnings depends, in part, on our
ability to compete with these operators.

Cable Television

.

Cable television operators have a large, established
customer base, and many have significant investments in, and access to,
programming. Of the 97% of United States television households in which cable
television service was available as of December 31, 2003, approximately 64%
subscribed to cable. Cable television operators continue to leverage their
advantages relative to us by, among other things, bundling their analog video
service with expanded digital video services delivered terrestrially or via
satellite, offering efficient 2-way high-speed Internet access, and telephone
service on upgraded cable systems, providing service to multiple television
sets within the same household at a lesser incremental cost to the consumer,
and providing local and other programming in a larger number of geographic
areas. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to continue
to expand our subscriber base or compete effectively against cable television
operators.

DirecTV and other DBS and Direct-to-Home System Operators

.

During December
2003, an affiliate of News Corporation acquired a 34% controlling interest in
The DirecTV Group (formerly known as Hughes Electronics Corporation), the owner
of DirecTV. News Corporation’s diverse world-wide satellite, content and other
related businesses may provide competitive advantages to DirecTV with respect
to the acquisition of programming, content and other assets valuable to our
industry.

DirecTV’s satellite receivers are sold in a significantly greater number of
consumer electronics stores than ours. As a result of this and other factors,
our services are less well known to consumers than those of DirecTV. Due to
this relative lack of consumer awareness and other factors, we are at a
competitive marketing disadvantage compared to DirecTV.

According to SEC filings made by DirecTV Holdings LLC, DirecTV owns a fleet of
seven high powered DBS satellites, has 46 DBS frequencies that are capable of
full coverage of the continental United States, offered more than 800 channels
of combined video and audio programming and has approximately 12.2 million
subscribers. We believe DirecTV continues to be in an advantageous position
relative to our company with regard to, among other things, certain programming
packages, and, possibly, volume discounts for programming offers.

Furthermore, other companies in the United States have conditional permits or
have leased transponders for a comparatively small number of DBS frequencies
that can be used to provide service to portions of the United States, and
Rainbow DBS Company LLC (an affiliate of one of the largest cable providers in
the United States) has recently launched its own DBS satellite. New entrants
such as Rainbow DBS may have a competitive advantage over us in



deploying some new products and technologies because of the substantial costs
we would be required to incur to make new products or technologies available
across our installed base of over 9 million subscribers.

VHF/UHF Broadcasters

.

Most areas of the United States can receive traditional
terrestrial VHF/UHF television broadcasts of between 3 and 10 channels. These
broadcasters provide local, network and syndicated programming. The local
content nature of the programming may be important to the consumer, and VHF/UHF
programming is typically provided free of charge. In addition, the FCC has
allocated additional digital spectrum to licensed broadcasters. At least
during a transition period, each existing television station will be able to
retain its present analog frequencies and also transmit programming on a
digital channel that may permit multiple programming services per channel. Our
business could be adversely affected by continued free broadcast of local and
other programming and increased program offerings by traditional broadcasters.

New Technologies and Competitors.

New technologies also could have a material
adverse effect on the demand for our DBS services. For example, new and
advanced local multi-point video distribution services are currently being
implemented. In addition, entities such as regional telephone companies, which
are likely to have greater resources than we have, are implementing and
supporting digital video compression over existing telephone lines and digital
“wireless cable.” These companies are also developing video-over-fiber
technologies that have the potential to dramatically increase the amount and
quality of video programming distributed via the internet. Our ability to
compete successfully with these and other new technologies will be impacted by,
among other things, increasing demand for high definition television, or HDTV,
programming. We may have difficulty developing competitive HDTV-related
technology and securing adequate spectrum capacity for transmission of HDTV
signals.

In addition to the challenges posed by new technologies, mergers, joint
ventures, and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable television
operators, regional Bell operating companies and others may result in the
creation of new or more integrated providers capable of offering bundled cable
television and telecommunications services in competition with us. We may not
be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or new entrants in
the market for subscription television services.

ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

EchoStar Technologies Corporation (“ETC”), one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, internally designs and develops EchoStar receiver systems. Our
satellite receivers have won numerous awards from the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association, retailers and industry trade publications. We
outsource the manufacture of EchoStar receiver systems to third parties who
manufacture the receivers in accordance with our specifications.

The primary purpose of our ETC division is to support the DISH Network.
However, in addition to supplying EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH
Network, ETC also sells similar digital satellite receivers internationally,
either directly to television service operators or to our independent
distributors worldwide. This has created a source of additional business for
us and synergies that directly benefit DISH Network. For example, our
satellite receivers are designed around the Digital Video Broadcasting
standard, which is widely used in Europe and Asia. The same employees who
design EchoStar receiver systems for the DISH Network are also involved in
designing set-top boxes sold to international TV customers. Consequently, we
benefit from the possibility that ETC’s international projects may result in
improvements in design and economies of scale in the production of EchoStar
receiver systems for the DISH Network.

We believe that direct-to-home satellite service is particularly well-suited
for countries without extensive cable infrastructure, and we are actively
soliciting new business for ETC. However, there can be no assurance that ETC
will be able to develop additional international business or maintain its
existing customers.

Through 2003, our primary international customer was Bell ExpressVu, a
subsidiary of Bell Canada, Canada’s national telephone company. We currently
have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu, and we are actively
trying to secure new orders from other potential international customers.
However, we cannot guarantee at this time that those negotiations will be
successful. Our future international revenue depends largely on the success of
these and other international operators, which in turn, depends on other
factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of direct-to-home satellite
TV products and the increasing intensity of competition for international
subscription television subscribers.



ETC’s business also includes our Atlanta-based EchoStar Data Networks
Corporation and our UK-based Eldon Technology Limited subsidiaries. EchoStar
Data Networks is a supplier of technology for distributing Internet and other
content over satellite networks. Eldon Technology designs and tests various
software and other technology used in digital televisions and set-top boxes,
strengthening our product design capabilities for satellite receivers and
integrated televisions in both the international and United States markets.

Competition for Our ETC Business

Through ETC, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic
companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, financial or
otherwise, than we have. We expect new competitors to enter this market
because of rapidly changing technology. Our ability to anticipate these
technological changes and introduce enhanced products expeditiously will be a
significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. We do not know if we
will be able to successfully introduce new products and technologies on a
timely basis in order to remain competitive.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”). We are also regulated by other federal agencies, state and
local authorities and the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”).
Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations
promulgated by these entities could result in suspension or revocation of our
licenses or authorizations, the termination or loss of contracts or the
imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties.

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is not
intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and
legislation affecting the video programming distribution industry. Government
regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative
proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change our
industry to varying degrees. We cannot predict either the outcome of these
proceedings or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our
operations.

FCC Regulation under the Communications Act

FCC Jurisdiction over our Operations.

The Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, which we refer to as the “Communications Act”, gives the FCC broad
authority to regulate the operations of satellite companies. Specifically, the
Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over the following
areas relating to communications satellite operations:

In order to obtain FCC satellite licenses and authorizations, communication
satellite operators must satisfy strict legal, technical and financial
qualification requirements. Once issued, these licenses and authorizations are
subject



to a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of
ongoing due diligence obligations, construction milestones, and various
reporting requirements.

Our Basic DBS Frequency Licenses and Authorizations.

Most of our programming
is transmitted to our customers on frequencies in the 12.2 to 12.7 GHz range,
which we refer to as the “DBS” frequencies. We are licensed or authorized by
the FCC to operate DBS frequencies at the following orbital locations:

We also sublease six transponders (corresponding to six frequencies) at the
61.5 degree orbital location from licensee Dominion Video Satellite, Inc.

Our Satellites

.

We currently own and operate eight DBS satellites (EchoStar I
through EchoStar VIII) and one Fixed-Satellite Service (“FSS”) Ku/Ka-band
satellite (EchoStar IX). Our satellites operate at the following orbital
locations:

EchoStar IV is not equipped to operate on all three of our licensed frequencies
at the 157 degree orbital location. It is therefore currently operating on a
different three-channel configuration at that location under a Special
Temporary Authority (“STA”). The STA expired on February 15, 2004. While we
have requested both an extension of the STA and a modification of our license
to permit that configuration, we cannot be sure that the FCC will grant these
requests.

Duration of our Satellite Licenses and Authorizations.

Generally speaking, all
of our satellite licenses are subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC.
While under a recent FCC rulemaking the term of certain satellite licenses has
been extended from 10 to 15 years, the term of DBS licenses remains at 10
years; our licenses are currently set to expire at various times starting as
early as 2006. In addition, our special temporary authorizations are granted
for periods of only 180 days or less, subject again to possible renewal by the
FCC.



Opposition and other Risks to our Licenses and Authorizations.

Several third
parties have opposed, and we expect them to continue to oppose, some of our FCC
satellite authorizations and pending requests to the FCC for extensions,
modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses. In addition, we have not
filed, or have not timely filed, certain reports required in connection with
our satellite authorizations. Because of this opposition and our failure to
comply with certain requirements of our authorizations, it is possible the FCC
could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to extend or renew certain of our
authorizations or licenses.

On January 16, 2004, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard arguments
in a challenge brought by Advanced Communications Corporation (“Advanced”), the
former holder of DBS permits at the 110 degrees and 148 degrees west orbital
locations, against the FCC’s 1995 cancellation of its permits. While previous
appeals by Advanced have failed, we cannot be certain that Advanced will not
ultimately be successful. If it is successful, certain of our licenses to
operate core DBS satellites from those orbital locations may be at risk in
further FCC proceedings.

Our FSS Licenses

. In addition to our DBS licenses and authorizations, we have
received conditional licenses from the FCC to operate Fixed-Satellite Service
(“FSS”) satellites in the Ka-band and the Ku-band, including licenses to
operate EchoStar IX (a hybrid Ka/Ku-band satellite) at the 121 degree orbital
location. EchoStar also recently received Ka-band licenses at the 97 and 123
degree orbital locations. Use of these licenses and conditional authorizations
is subject to certain technical and due diligence requirements, including the
requirement to construct and launch satellites according to specific milestones
and deadlines. Our projects to construct and launch Ku-band, extended Ku-band
and Ka-band satellites are in various stages of development.

Risks to our Ka-Band and Ku-Band Authorizations.

On March 15, 2004, we
relinquished our license for a Ku-band satellite at the 83 degree orbital
location and declined our license for a Ka-band satellite at the 125 degree
orbital location. With respect to our license for a Ka-band system at the 83
degree orbital location, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation of
the satellite system to be completed by June 25, 2005. The FCC has stated that
it may cancel our corresponding authorizations if we fail to file adequate
reports or to demonstrate progress in the construction of that satellite
system. In addition, some companies with interests adverse to ours are
challenging our licenses. Our Ka-band licenses at the 83 and 121 degree
orbital locations allow us to use only 500 MHz of Ka-band spectrum in each
direction, while certain other licensees have been authorized to use 1000 MHz
in each direction. Our Ka-band licenses at the 123 and 97 degree orbital
locations are for the full 1000 MHz in each direction. With respect to these
licenses, the FCC requires construction, launch and operation of the satellites
to be completed by December of 2008 and March 2009 respectively. ITU
deadlines, however, require satellites to be operating at those slots by June
of 2005. There can be no assurance that we will develop acceptable plans to
meet these deadlines, or that we will be able to utilize the orbital slot.

VisionStar.

We also own a 90% interest in VisionStar, Inc. (“VisionStar”),
which holds a Ka-band license at the 113 degree orbital location. VisionStar
did not complete construction or launch of the satellite by the required
milestone deadlines and has requested an extension of those milestones from the
FCC. Failure to receive an extension would render the license invalid.

Recent FCC Rulemaking Affecting our Licenses and Applications.

The FCC has
recently changed its system for processing applications to a “first-come,
first-served” process. Since that change became effective, we have filed or
refiled, and have pending before the FCC, new applications for as many as nine
satellites in several different frequency bands. Several of our direct or
indirect competitors have filed petitions to deny or dismiss certain of our
pending applications or have requested that conditions be placed on
authorizations we requested. We have received Ka-band licenses for the 97, 123
and 125 degree orbital locations, while a number of other applications have
been dismissed without prejudice by the FCC. We cannot be sure that the FCC
will grant any of our outstanding applications, or that the authorizations, if
granted, will not be subject to onerous conditions. Moreover, the cost of
building, launching and insuring a satellite can be as much as $250 million or
more, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to construct and launch all of
satellites for which we have requested authorizations. The FCC has also
imposed a $5 million bond requirement for all future satellite licenses, which
would be forfeited by a licensee that does not meet its diligence milestones
for a particular satellite. We have already posted a bond for the Ka-band
license we recently received at the 123 degree orbital location and must post a
bond for our Ka-band licenses at the 97 degree orbital location or forfeit our
license for that location.



New Satellite License Auction Proceedings

. The FCC has proposed to auction
licenses for DBS frequencies at the 61.5 degree, 157 degree, 166 degree and 175
degree orbital locations. Rainbow, a DBS licensee with a satellite at the 61.5
degree orbital location, has argued that we should not be eligible to bid for
two available channels at the 61.5 degree orbital location. If this argument
is accepted by the FCC, it will prevent us from acquiring these channels and
making more productive use of the satellite operating at that orbital location.
On January 15, 2004, the FCC affirmed that it had the necessary auction
authority and that no eligibility restrictions were warranted for the 157, 166
and 175 degree licenses. It deferred the question of eligibility restrictions
that would preclude us from bidding for the 61.5 degree license to a separate
order.

Expansion DBS Spectrum

. The FCC has also allocated additional expansion
spectrum for DBS services commencing in 2007. This could create significant
additional competition in the market for subscription television services. We
filed applications for such additional spectrum during March 2002 but cannot
predict whether the FCC will grant these applications.

Other Services in the DBS band

. The FCC has also adopted rules that allow
non-geostationary orbit fixed satellite services to operate on a co-primary
basis in the same frequency as direct broadcast satellite and Ku-band-based
fixed satellite services. In the same rulemaking, the FCC authorized use of
the DBS spectrum that we use by terrestrial communication services. The FCC
recently auctioned licenses for these terrestrial services during January,
2004. We are a passive investor in one of the winning bidders in the auction,
but we cannot be sure that licenses will in fact be awarded to that bidder.
Also, there can be no assurance that operations by non-geostationary orbit
fixed satellite services or terrestrial communication services in the DBS band
will not interfere with our DBS operations.

Proposals to allow 4.5 Degree Spacing.

During April 2002, SES Americom, Inc.
requested a declaratory ruling that it is in the public interest for SES
Americom to offer satellite capacity for third party direct-to-home services to
consumers in the United States and certain British Overseas Territories in the
Caribbean. SES Americom proposes to employ a satellite licensed by the
Government of Gibraltar to operate in the same uplink and downlink frequency
bands as us, from an orbital position located in between two orbital locations
where EchoStar and DirecTV have already positioned satellites. DirecTV, which
opposes SES’s petition, has itself filed a petition for rulemaking for
standards to permit such 4.5 degree spacing. On January 23, 2004, we filed
comments in response to DirectTV’s petition for rulemaking. We stated in these
filings that we believe 4.5 degree spacing is feasible and noted that we
ourselves have filed applications for satellites located 4.5 degrees from
existing DBS satellites. We acknowledged, however, that such narrow spacing
presents risks of interference with current DBS operations. DirecTV has
recently requested FCC authority to provide service to the United States from a
Canadian orbital slot. The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the
U.S. from closer-spaced DBS slots and from foreign slots may permit additional
competition against us from other DBS providers.

Rules Relating to Alaska and Hawaii

. The holders of DBS authorizations issued
after January 19, 1996 must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii if such
service is technically feasible from the authorized orbital location. Our
authorizations at the 110 degree, 148 degree and 157 degree orbital locations
were received after January 19, 1996. While we provide service to Alaska and
Hawaii from both the 110 and 119 degree orbital locations, those states have
expressed the view that our service should more closely resemble our service to
the mainland United States and otherwise needs improvement. Further, the
satellite we currently operate at the 148 and 157 degree orbital locations are
not able to provide service to Alaska and/or Hawaii. We received temporary
waivers of the service requirement for the 148 degree orbital location subject
to several conditions and have requested a similar waiver for the 157 degree
orbital location. However, the FCC could revoke these waivers or reject our
request for a new waiver at any time.

The FCC has also concluded a rulemaking which seeks to streamline and revise
its rules governing DBS operators. In connection with this rulemaking, the FCC
clarified its geographic service requirements to introduce a requirement that
we provide programming packages to residents of Hawaii and Alaska that are
“reasonably comparable” to what we offer in the contiguous 48 states. We cannot
be sure that this requirement will not affect us adversely by requiring us to
devote additional resources to serving these two states.



Other Communications Act Provisions

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services.

The FCC imposes different rules for
“subscription” and “broadcast” services. We believe that because we offer a
subscription programming service, we are not subject to many of the regulatory
obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees. However, we cannot be certain
whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory
obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we
be treated as a broadcaster. If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast
licensee, it could require us to comply with all regulatory obligations imposed
upon broadcast licensees, which are generally subject to more burdensome
regulation than subscription television service providers.

Public Interest Requirements.

Under a requirement of the Cable Act, the FCC
imposed public interest requirements on DBS licensees. These rules require us
to set aside four percent of channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial
programming for which we must charge programmers below-cost rates and for which
we may not impose additional charges on subscribers. This could displace
programming for which we could earn commercial rates and could adversely affect
our financial results. The FCC has generally not reviewed all aspects of our
methodology for processing carriage requests, computing the channel capacity we
must set aside or determining the rates that we charge public interest
programmers. We cannot be sure that, if the FCC were to review these
methodologies, it would find them in compliance with the public interest
requirements. Certain parties have challenged certain aspects of our
methodology in a pending proceeding, and we have recently received a letter
from the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau regarding these issues. We cannot be sure
that the Commission will not take enforcement action against us, which may
result in fines and/or changes to our methodology for compliance with these
rules.

Other Open Access Requirements.

The FCC has also commenced a proceeding
regarding distribution of high-speed Internet access services and interactive
television services. We cannot be sure that the FCC will not ultimately impose
open access obligations on us, which could be very onerous, and could create a
significant strain on our capacity and ability to provide other services.

Plug and Play.

The FCC has recently adopted the so-called “plug and play”
standard for compatibility between digital television sets and cable systems.
That standard was developed through negotiations involving the cable and
consumer electronics industries but not us, and we are concerned that it
imposes certain “encoding rules” on all multichannel video programming
distributors, including us, and that the standard and its implementation
process favor cable systems. We have filed a petition for review of the FCC’s
“plug and play” order with the federal Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit on various grounds, but we cannot be sure that the court will
not uphold the FCC’s decision. The FCC has also recently adopted the
“broadcast flag” method for copy-protecting content broadcast digitally over
the air. The cable industry has requested that certain requirements
established by the FCC also extend to DBS set-top boxes. It is too early to
fully assess the risks to us from the adoption of these standards and the
possible extension of these requirements to DBS boxes.

The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act

Retransmission of Distant Networks.

The Copyright Act, as amended by the
Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, or “SHVIA”, permits satellite
retransmission of distant network channels only to “unserved households.” An
example of a distant station retransmission is a Los Angeles network station
retransmitted by satellite to a subscriber outside of Los Angeles. That
subscriber qualifies as an “unserved household” if he or she cannot receive,
over the air, a signal of sufficient intensity (“Grade B” intensity) from a
local station affiliated with the same network.

SHVIA also established a process whereby consumers predicted to be served by a
local station may request that this station waive the unserved household
limitation so that the requesting consumer may receive distant signals by
satellite. If the waiver request is denied, SHVIA entitles the consumer to
request an actual test, with the cost to be borne by either the satellite
carrier, such as us, or the broadcast station depending on the results. The
testing process required by the statute can be very costly.

In addition, SHVIA has affected and continues to affect us adversely in several
other respects. The legislation prohibits us from carrying more than two
distant signals for each broadcasting network and leaves the FCC’s Grade B
intensity standard unchanged without future legislation. The FCC rules
mandated by SHVIA require us to delete



substantial programming (including sports programming) from these signals.
Although we have implemented certain measures in our effort to comply with
these rules, these requirements have significantly hampered and may further
hamper our ability to retransmit distant network and superstation signals. The
burdens the rules impose upon us may become so onerous that we may be required
to substantially alter or stop retransmitting many or all superstation signals.
In addition, the FCC’s sports blackout requirements, which apply to all
distant network signals, may require costly upgrades to our system.

The statutory license for retransmitting distant stations is set to expire on
December 31, 2004, and we cannot be sure that Congress will extend that
license. If the license is not extended, we will be unable to retransmit
distant stations altogether.

Opposition to Our Delivery of Distant Signals.

See “Item 3 - Legal Proceedings
– Distant Network Litigation” for information regarding opposition to our
delivery of distant signals.

Retransmission of Local Networks.

SHVIA, generally gives satellite companies a
statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite
back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the
retransmission consent of the local network station. If we fail to reach
retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters we cannot carry their
signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with
cable and other satellite companies, which provide local signals.

While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most
local network stations in markets where we currently offer local channels by
satellite, roll-out of local channels in additional cities will require that we
obtain additional retransmission agreements. We cannot be sure that we will
secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements upon the
expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are
short term. SHVIA requires broadcasters to negotiate retransmission consent
agreements in good faith but FCC rules implementing that obligation provide
very few limitations on broadcasters’ actions.

“Must Carry” and Other Requirements.

SHVIA also imposes “must carry”
requirements on DBS providers and the FCC has adopted detailed “must carry”
rules applicable to us. These rules generally require that satellite
distributors carry all the local broadcast stations requesting carriage in a
timely and appropriate manner in areas where they choose to offer local
programming, not just the four major networks. Since we have limited capacity,
the number of markets in which we can offer local programming is reduced by the
“must carry” rules because we are required to carry large numbers of stations
in each market we serve. The legislation also includes provisions that could
expose us to material monetary penalties, and permanent prohibitions on the
sale of all local and distant network channels, based on inadvertent violations
of the legislation, prior law, or the FCC rules. Imposition of these penalties
would have a material adverse effect on our business operations generally.

Several “must carry” complaints by broadcasters against us are pending at the
FCC. The FCC has ruled against us in certain of these proceedings, and we
cannot be sure that the FCC will rule in our favor in other pending or future
proceedings. Such a ruling could result in a decrease in the number of local
areas where we can offer local network programming. This in turn could increase
churn in those markets and preclude us from offering local network channels in
new markets, thereby reducing our competitiveness.

Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the FCC will not interpret or implement its
rules in such a manner as to inhibit our use of our two-dish solution to comply
with the “must carry” requirements. The National Association of Broadcasters
and Association of Local Television Stations filed an emergency petition during
2002 asking the FCC to modify or clarify its rules to prohibit or hamper our
compliance plan. In response, during April 2002, a bureau of the FCC issued a
declaratory ruling and order finding that our compliance plan violated certain
provisions of SHVIA and the FCC’s “must carry” regulations. Challenges to the
April 2002 order have been filed by various parties, including one by us, and
are presently pending.

During April 2002, the FCC bureau also issued an order granting in part
numerous complaints filed against us by individual broadcast stations that
claimed violations of the “must carry” requirements similar to those addressed
in the prior April 2002 order. Depending upon the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings (including the extent to which our compliance reports are
accepted), further orders by the bureau or the FCC itself could result in a
decrease in the number of local areas where we will be able to offer local
network programming until new satellites are



launched. This, in turn, could significantly increase the churn of subscribers
in those areas where local network programming is no longer offered and impair
our ability to gain new subscribers in those areas, which could materially
adversely affect our financial performance. We could also be exposed to damage
claims by local stations if we are found by any court to have violated the
“must carry” requirements. These damage claims could materially adversely
affect our financial position.

Finally, while the FCC has decided for now not to impose “must carry”
obligations on satellite carriers for high definition television stations or
dual digital/analog carriage obligations — i.e., additional requirements in
connection with the carriage of digital television stations that go beyond
carriage of one signal (whether analog or standard definition digital) for each
station, the FCC still has pending rulemaking proceedings on these matters.
These proceedings may result in further, even more onerous, digital carriage
requirements.

Dependence on Cable Act for Program Access

We purchase a substantial percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated
programmers. The Cable Act’s provisions prohibiting exclusive contracting
practices with cable affiliated programmers have been extended from October
2002 to October 2007, but this extension could be reversed. Upon expiration of
those provisions, many popular programs may become unavailable to us, causing a
loss of customers and adversely affecting our revenues and financial
performance. Any change in the Cable Act and the FCC’s rules that would permit
the cable industry or cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against
competing businesses, such as ours, in the sale of programming could adversely
affect our ability to acquire programming at all or to acquire programming on a
cost-effective basis. We believe that the FCC generally has not shown a
willingness to enforce the program access rules aggressively. As a result, we
may be limited in our ability to obtain access (or non-discriminatory access)
to programming from programmers that are affiliated with the cable system
operators.

Affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports
programming they feed to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by
satellite. To the extent that cable operators deliver additional programming
terrestrially in the future, they may assert that this additional programming
is also exempt from the program access laws. These restrictions on our access
to programming could materially adversely affect our ability to compete in
regions serviced by these cable providers.

The International Telecommunication Union

Our DBS system also must conform to the International Telecommunication Union,
or “ITU”, broadcasting satellite service plan. If any of our operations are not
consistent with this plan, the ITU will only provide authorization on a
non-interference basis pending successful modification of the plan or the
agreement of all affected administrations to the non-conforming operations.
Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its broadcasting satellite
service plan to include the technical parameters of DBS applicants’ operations,
our satellites, along with those of other DBS operators, must not cause harmful
electrical interference with other assignments that are in conformance with the
plan. Further, DBS satellites are not presently entitled to any protection from
other satellites that are in conformance with the plan. The United States
government has filed modification requests with the ITU for EchoStar I,
EchoStar II and EchoStar III. The ITU has requested certain technical
information in order to process the requested modifications. We have
cooperated, and continue to cooperate, with the FCC in the preparation of its
responses to the ITU requests. We cannot predict when the ITU will act upon
these requests for modification or if they will be granted.

Export Control Regulation

We are required to obtain import and general destination export licenses from
the United States government to receive and deliver components of
direct-to-home satellite TV systems. In addition, the delivery of satellites
and related technical information for the purpose of launch by foreign launch
services providers is subject to strict export control and prior approval
requirements.



PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future
obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect
products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a court
determines that one or more of our products infringes on intellectual property
held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those
products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property, or
to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent
claims. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may
be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could
adversely affect our competitive position.

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our products may
potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the United States are
confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office issues a patent and,
accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in pending patent
applications of which we are not aware. Further, the process of determining
definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid often involves expensive
and protracted litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to
obtain intellectual property licenses or the availability and cost of any such
licenses. Those costs, and their impact on net income, could be material.
Damages in patent infringement cases may also include treble damages in certain
circumstances. To the extent that we are required to pay unanticipated
royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could
negatively affect our liquidity and operating results. We are currently
defending patent infringement actions. We cannot be certain the courts will
conclude these companies do not own the rights they claim, that our products do
not infringe on these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from
these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain
such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid
infringement. See “Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.”

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign
environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These
include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management.
We attempt to maintain compliance with all such requirements. We do not expect
capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in
2004 or 2005. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and
have become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance
that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future
in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

WIC Premium Television Ltd.

During July 1998, WIC Premium Television Ltd. (“WIC”), an Alberta corporation,
filed a lawsuit against us in the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division.
General Instrument Corporation, HBO, Warner Communications, Inc., Showtime and
United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. were also named as
defendants.

During September 1998, WIC filed another lawsuit against us in the Court of
Queen’s Bench of Alberta Judicial District of Edmonton. WIC is authorized to
broadcast certain copyrighted work, such as movies and concerts, to residents
of Canada. WIC alleged that the defendants engaged in, promoted, and/or
allowed satellite dish equipment from the United States to be sold in Canada
and to Canadian residents and that some of the defendants allowed and profited
from Canadian residents purchasing and viewing subscription television
programming that is only authorized for viewing in the United States. During
December 2003, the matter was dismissed with no impact on our business.

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, we obtained feeds of distant broadcast network channels (ABC,
NBC, CBS and FOX) for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24. In
December 1998, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida entered a nationwide permanent injunction requiring PrimeTime 24 to
shut off distant network channels to many of its customers, and henceforth to
sell those channels to consumers in accordance with the injunction.

In October 1998, we filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC, NBC, CBS
and FOX in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. We
asked the Court to find that our method of providing distant network
programming did not violate the Satellite Home Viewer Act and hence did not
infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November 1998, the networks and their
affiliate association groups filed a complaint against us in Miami Federal
Court



alleging, among other things, copyright infringement. The Court combined
the case that we filed in Colorado with the case in Miami and transferred it to
the Miami Federal Court.

In February 1999, the networks filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order,
Preliminary Injunction and Contempt Finding against DirecTV, Inc. in Miami
related to the delivery of distant network channels to DirecTV customers by
satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the networks. Under the terms of
the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV customers were
scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels
by July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by
December 31, 1999. Subsequently, substantially all providers of
satellite-delivered network programming other than us agreed to this cut-off
schedule, although we do not know if they adhered to this schedule.

In April 2002, we reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. In
November 2002, we reached a private settlement with NBC, another of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. On
March 10, 2004, we reached a private settlement with CBS, another of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. We
have also reached private settlements with many independent stations and
station groups. We were unable to reach a settlement with five of the original
eight plaintiffs –Fox and the associations affiliated with each of the four
networks.

A trial took place during April 2003 and the Court issued its final judgment in
June 2003. The District Court found that with one exception our current
distant network qualification procedures comply with the law. We have revised
our procedures to comply with the District Court’s Order. Although the
plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter an injunction precluding us from
selling any local or distant network programming, the District Court refused.
While the networks did not claim monetary damages and none were awarded, they
are seeking approximately $10.0 million of attorney fees.

The District Court’s injunction requires us to use a computer model to
re-qualify, as of June 2003, all of our subscribers who receive ABC, NBC, CBS
or Fox programming by satellite from a market other than the city in which the
subscriber lives. The Court also invalidated all waivers historically provided
by network stations. These waivers, which have been provided by stations for
the past several years through a third party automated system, allow
subscribers who believe the computer model improperly disqualified them for
distant network channels to none-the-less receive those channels by satellite.
Further, even though the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act provides that
certain subscribers who received distant network channels prior to October 1999
can continue to receive those channels through December 2004, the District
Court terminated the right of our grandfathered subscribers to continue to
receive distant network channels.

We believe the District Court made a number of errors and appealed the District
Court’s decision. Plaintiffs cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals granted our
request to stay the injunction until our appeal is decided. Oral argument
occurred on February 26, 2004. It is not possible to predict how or when the
Court of Appeals will rule on the merits of our appeal.

In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the injunction, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt
to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network
channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where available,
and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict
with any degree of certainty how many subscribers will cancel their primary
DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all
subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we
are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result, among
other things, in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in churn.



Gemstar

During October 2000, Starsight Telecast, Inc., a subsidiary of Gemstar-TV Guide
International, Inc. (“Gemstar”), filed a suit for patent infringement against
us and certain of our subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the
Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent No. 4,706,121 (“the ‘121 Patent”) which
relates to certain electronic program guide functions.

In December 2000, we filed suit against Gemstar-TV Guide (and certain of its
subsidiaries) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
alleging violations by Gemstar of various federal and state anti-trust laws and
laws governing unfair competition. Gemstar filed counterclaims alleging
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,923,362 and 5,684,525 that relate
to certain electronic program guide functions. In addition, Gemstar asserted
new patent infringement counterclaims regarding United States Patent Nos.
4,908,713 and 5,915,068. These patents relate to on-screen programming of
VCRs.

In February 2001, Gemstar filed patent infringement actions against us in the
District Court in Atlanta, Georgia and with the ITC. These suits allege
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,252,066, 5,479,268 and 5,809,204,
all of which relate to certain electronic program guide functions. In
addition, the ITC action alleged infringement of the ‘121 Patent which was also
asserted in the North Carolina case previously discussed. On March 1, 2004, we
entered into a number of agreements with Gemstar including a settlement
agreement which provides for the resolution of the aforementioned disputes
between us and Gemstar. The effectiveness of the settlement is subject to
certain conditions, including the previously discussed closing of the SNG sale.

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) also filed suit against us,
DirecTV and others in the United States District Court for the Western District
of North Carolina, Asheville Division, alleging infringement of United States
Patent Nos. 5,038,211, 5,293,357 and 4,751,578 which relate to certain
electronic program guide functions, including the use of electronic program
guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and declaratory relief
and damages in an unspecified amount. It is our understanding that these
patents may be licensed by Superguide to Gemstar. Gemstar was added as a party
to this case and asserted these patents against us. We examined these patents
and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or services. A
Markman ruling interpreting the patent claims was issued by the Court and in
response to that ruling, we filed motions for summary judgment of
non-infringement for each of the asserted patents. Gemstar filed a motion for
summary judgment of infringement with respect to one of the patents. During
July 2002, the Court issued a Memorandum of Opinion on the summary judgment
motions. In its Opinion, the Court ruled that none of our products infringe
the 5,038,211 and 5,293,357 patents. With respect to the 4,751,578 patent, the
Court ruled that none of our current products infringed that patent and asked
for additional information before it could rule on certain low-volume products
that are no longer in production. During July 2002, the Court summarily ruled
that the aforementioned low-volume products did not infringe any of the
asserted patents. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case and awarded us our
court costs and the case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. On February 12, 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in
part and reversed in part the District Court’s findings and remanded the case
back to the District Court for further proceedings. We will continue to
vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines
that we infringe on any of the aforementioned patents, we may be subject to
substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that
could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly electronic
programming guide and related features that we currently offer to consumers.
It is not possible to make a firm assessment of the probable outcome of the
suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, LLC

In November of 2001, Broadcast Innovation, LLC filed a lawsuit against
EchoStar, DirecTV, Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District
Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (“the ‘094 patent”) and 4,992,066 (“the ‘066 patent”).
The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and
receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data. The
‘066 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling
circuitry for a pay television system on removable cards. We examined these
patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or
services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation
leaving EchoStar as the only defendant. On January 23, 2004, the judge issued
an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid as being indefinite in violation of 35
U.S.C. Sec. 112. Motions with respect to the infringement, invalidity and
construction



of the ‘094 patent remain pending. We will continue to vigorously defend this
case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we infringe on any
of the aforementioned patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which
may include treble damages and/or an injunction that could require us to
materially modify certain user-friendly features that we currently offer to
consumers. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of the probable
outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential liability or
damages.

TiVo Inc.

In January of 2004, TiVo Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. We have not yet filed our
answer. The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent No. 6,233,389
(“the ‘389 patent”). The ‘389 patent relates to certain methods and devices
for providing what the patent calls “time-warping”. We have examined this
patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court
ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we may be subject to
substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that
could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of
the probable outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential
liability or damages.

California Actions

A purported class action was filed against us in the California State Superior
Court for Alameda County during 2001 by Andrew A. Werby. The complaint related
to late fees, among other things. The matter was settled with no material
impact on our business.

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal clear
digital video,” “CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and with
respect to the number of channels available in various programming packages was
also filed against us in the California State Superior Court for Los Angeles
County in 1999 by David Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit
unincorporated association. The complaint alleges breach of express warranty
and violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code
Sections 1750, et seq., and the California Business & Professions Code Sections
17500 & 17200. A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and
our motion for summary judgment was held during June 2002. At the hearing, the
Court issued a preliminary ruling denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification. However, before issuing a final ruling on class certification,
the Court granted our motion for summary judgment with respect to all of the
plaintiffs’ claims. Subsequently, we filed a motion for attorney’s fees which
was denied by the Court. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the
court’s granting of our motion for summary judgment and we cross-appealed the
Court’s ruling on our motion for attorney’s fees. On December 5, 2003, the
Court of Appeal affirmed in part; and reversed in part, the lower court’s
decision granting summary judgment in our favor. Specifically, the Court found
there were triable issues of fact as to whether we may have violated the
alleged consumer statutes “with representations concerning the number of
channels and the program schedule.” However, the Court found no triable issue
of fact as to whether the representations “crystal clear digital video” or “CD
quality” audio constituted a cause of action. Moreover, the Court affirmed
that the “reasonable consumer” standard was applicable to each of the alleged
consumer statutes. Plaintiff argued the standard should be the “least
sophisticated” consumer. The Court also affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’
breach of warranty claim. Plaintiff filed a Petition for Review with the
California Supreme Court and we responded. On March 24, 2004, the California
Supreme Court denied Plaintiff’s Petition for Review. Therefore, the action
has been remanded to the trial court pursuant to the instructions of the Court
of Appeal. It is too early in the litigation to make an assessment of the
probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any potential
liability against us.

State Investigation

During April 2002, two state attorneys general commenced a civil investigation
concerning certain of our business practices. Over the course of the next six
months, 11 additional states ultimately joined the investigation. The states
alleged failure to comply with consumer protection laws based on our call
response times and policies, advertising and customer agreement disclosures,
policies for handling consumer complaints, issuing rebates and refunds and
charging cancellation fees to consumers, and other matters. We cooperated
fully in the investigation. During May 2003, we



entered into an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance with the states which ended
their investigation. The states have released all claims related to the
matters investigated.

Retailer Class Actions

We have been sued by retailers in three separate purported class actions.
During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed in the Arapahoe County
District Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District Court
for the District of Colorado, respectively, by Air Communication & Satellite,
Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of themselves and a class of persons
similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify nationwide
classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The
plaintiffs are requesting the Courts to declare certain provisions of, and
changes to, alleged agreements between us and the retailers invalid and
unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and payments, charge
backs, and other compensation. We are vigorously defending against the suits
and have asserted a variety of counterclaims. The United States District Court
for the District of Colorado stayed the Federal Court action to allow the
parties to pursue a comprehensive adjudication of their dispute in the Arapahoe
County State Court. John DeJong, d/b/a Nexwave, and Joseph Kelley, d/b/a
Keltronics, subsequently intervened in the Arapahoe County Court action as
plaintiffs and proposed class representatives. We have filed a motion for
summary judgment on all counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have
filed a motion for additional time to conduct discovery to enable them to
respond to our motion. The Court has not ruled on either of the two motions.
It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation
or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Satellite Dealers Supply, Inc. (“SDS”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas during September 2000,
on behalf of itself and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiff
was attempting to certify a nationwide class on behalf of sellers, installers,
and servicers of satellite equipment who contract with us and who allege that
we: (1) charged back certain fees paid by members of the class to professional
installers in violation of contractual terms; (2) manipulated the accounts of
subscribers to deny payments to class members; and (3) misrepresented, to class
members, the ownership of certain equipment related to the provision of our
satellite television service. During September 2001, the Court granted our
motion to dismiss. The plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the Court’s
order dismissing the case. The Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration. The trial court denied our motions for sanctions against SDS.
Both parties perfected appeals before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On
appeal, the Fifth Circuit upheld the dismissal for lack of personal
jurisdiction. The Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded the district court’s
denial of our motion for sanctions and instructed the district court to decide
the issue again and to issue a written opinion, which it had failed to do the
first time. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of the probable
outcome on that issue or to determine the extent of any recovery of sanctions.

StarBand Shareholder Lawsuit

On August 20, 2002, a limited group of shareholders in StarBand filed an action
in the Delaware Court of Chancery against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation,
together with four EchoStar executives who sat on the Board of Directors for
StarBand, for alleged breach of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith
and loyalty, and also against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation for aiding and
abetting such alleged breaches. Two of the individual defendants, Charles W.
Ergen and David K. Moskowitz, are members of our Board of Directors. The
action stems from the defendants’ involvement as directors, and EchoBand’s
position as a shareholder, in StarBand, a broadband Internet satellite venture
in which we invested. On July 28, 2003, the Court granted the defendants’
motion to dismiss on all counts. The Plaintiffs have since filed a notice of
appeal. Oral argument on the appeal was held on January 6, 2004. EchoStar is
waiting for the decision on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. It is not
possible to make a firm assessment of the probable outcome of the appeal or to
determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Shareholder Derivative Action

During October 2002, a purported shareholder filed a derivative action against
members of our Board of Directors in the United States District Court of Clark
County, Nevada and naming us as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges
breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and other unlawful acts relating to
our agreement to (1) pay Hughes Electronics Corporation a $600.0 million
termination fee in certain circumstances and (2) acquire Hughes’ shareholder
interest in PanAmSat. The agreements to pay the termination fee and acquire
PanAmSat were required in the event



that the merger with DirecTV was not completed by January 21, 2003. During
July 2003, the individual Board of Director defendants were dismissed from the
suit, and EchoStar was dismissed during August 2003. The plaintiff did not
file an appeal.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment Complaint

On November 6, 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, against approximately 100
defendants, including us, who invested in Enron’s commercial paper. The
complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 prepayment of its commercial paper
is a voidable preference under the bankruptcy laws and constitutes a fraudulent
conveyance. The complaint alleges that we received voidable or fraudulent
prepayments of approximately $40.0 million. We typically invest in commercial
paper and notes which are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by
at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. At the
time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was considered to be high
quality and considered to be a very low risk. It is too early to make an
assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent
of any potential liability or damages.

Satellite Insurance

In September 1998, we filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a total loss
under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The satellite
insurance consists of separate substantially identical policies with different
carriers for varying amounts that, in combination, create a total insured
amount of $219.3 million. The insurance carriers include La Reunion Spatiale;
AXA Reinsurance Company (n/k/a AXA Corporate Solutions Reinsurance Company),
United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc., United States Aircraft Insurance
Group; Assurances Generales De France I.A.R.T. (AGF); Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s, London; Great Lakes Reinsurance (U.K.) PLC; British Aviation Insurance
Group; If Skaadeforsikring (previously Storebrand); Hannover Re (a/k/a
International Hannover); The Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Company, Ltd.;
Marham Space Consortium (a/k/a Marham Consortium Management); Ace Global
Markets (a/k/a Ace London); M.C. Watkins Syndicate; Goshawk Syndicate
Management Ltd.; D.E. Hope Syndicate 10009 (Formerly Busbridge); Amlin
Aviation; K.J. Coles & Others; H.R. Dumas & Others; Hiscox Syndicates, Ltd.;
Cox Syndicate; Hayward Syndicate; D.J. Marshall & Others; TF Hart; Kiln;
Assitalia Le Assicurazioni D’Italia S.P.A. Roma; La Fondiaria Assicurazione
S.P.A., Firenze; Vittoria Assicurazioni S.P.A., Milano; Ras – Riunione
Adriatica Di Sicurta S.P.A., Milano; Societa Cattolica Di Assicurazioni,
Verano; Siat Assicurazione E Riassicurazione S.P.A, Genova; E. Patrick; ZC
Specialty Insurance; Lloyds of London Syndicates 588 NJM, 1209 Meb AND 861 Meb;
Generali France Assurances; Assurance France Aviation; and Ace Bermuda
Insurance Ltd.

The insurance carriers offered us a total of approximately $88.0 million, or
40% of the total policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance
claim. The insurers assert, among other things, that EchoStar IV was not a
total loss, as that term is defined in the policy, and that we did not abide by
the exact terms of the insurance policies. We strongly disagree and filed
arbitration claims against the insurers for breach of contract, failure to pay
a valid insurance claim and bad faith denial of a valid claim, among other
things. Due to individual forum selection clauses in certain of the policies,
we are pursuing our arbitration claims against Ace Bermuda Insurance Ltd. in
London, England, and our arbitration claims against all of the other insurance
carriers in New York, New York. The New York arbitration commenced on April
28, 2003, and the Arbitration Panel has now conducted approximately thirty-five
days of hearings. The parties to the London arbitration have agreed to stay
that proceeding pending a ruling in the New York arbitration. There can be no
assurance that we will receive the amount claimed in either the New York or the
London arbitrations or, if we do, that we will retain title to EchoStar IV with
its reduced capacity.

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our
opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions
is unlikely to materially affect our financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For competitive and other reasons, we are not providing specific operational or
financial guidance or projections for 2004. Our operating and financial
strategy for 2004 will focus on improving our operating results and free cash
flow by increasing our subscriber base, reducing churn, controlling rising
subscriber acquisition costs and maintaining or improving operating margins.

Operational Results and Goals

Increase subscriber base.

We added approximately 1.245 million net new
subscribers during 2003, ending the year with approximately 9.425 million DISH
Network subscribers. We remain committed to growing our subscriber base with
high quality customers by continuing to offer attractive consumer promotions
and DISH Network programming packages with a better “price-to-value”
relationship than packages currently offered by most other subscription
television providers. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current rate of
new subscriber growth if our
competitors offer more attractive consumer promotions, better priced or more
attractive programming packages, more compelling programming and services,
including advanced DVR and HDTV services or additional local
channels, or otherwise offer more attractive products and services
than us.

Reduce subscriber churn.

Our percentage monthly churn for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was approximately 1.57%, compared to our percentage churn for
the same period in 2002 of approximately 1.59%. We believe continued
tightening of credit requirements, together with promotions tailored toward
subscribers with multiple receivers and advanced products, will attract better
long-term subscribers and may help reduce churn. We plan to continue to offer
consumer promotions, loyalty programs and dealer programs to improve our
overall subscriber retention. We also continue to undertake initiatives with
respect to our conditional access system to further enhance the security of the
DISH Network signal and attempt to make theft of our programming commercially
impractical or uneconomical. However, many factors can impact churn and
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or reduce
subscriber churn, or that our churn will not increase in future
periods.

Our success in increasing our subscriber base and reducing churn will depend
on, among other things, our ability to:

•

Offer new and compelling programming and services.

We plan to
offer our subscribers new and compelling programming and services,
including next generation digital video recorder, or DVR, services,
additional high-definition television, or HDTV, channels and
interactive programming. In addition, we continue to develop
bundled broadband service solutions as we believe this can help us gain
and maintain market share, and retain subscribers.

•

Expand the availability of local channels.

Assuming successful
launch and continued nominal operation of our satellites, we expect to
increase our local channel coverage from 110 markets to over 140
markets representing approximately 94% of United States television
households, by the end of 2004.

•

Improve distribution channels.

We continue to strengthen our
distribution channels for our DISH Network business unit through, among
other things, new and improved commercial relationships with companies
like SBC and Qwest.

•

Increase satellite capacity.

With the formation of strategic
alliances with fixed satellite services providers, the successful launch of
EchoStar IX and the completion of a contract for the future
construction of EchoStar X, we continue to increase our satellite
capacity for additional programming and services.

Financial Results and Goals

Control rising subscriber acquisition costs.

We generally subsidize
installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in
order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our average subscriber
acquisition costs on a per new subscriber activation basis were approximately
$453 during 2003 compared to $421 in 2002, excluding costs capitalized for
leased equipment. If a subscriber churns early in the average subscriber
life-cycle,



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

we cannot fully recover the costs related to the acquisition of that
subscriber. We believe continued tightening of credit requirements, together
with promotions tailored toward subscribers with multiple receivers and
advanced products, will attract better long-term subscribers. In addition, as
a result of recent changes in our equipment lease promotion, in 2004 we
anticipate an increase in the number of subscribers who lease rather than
purchase equipment. The resulting anticipated increase in capitalized costs is
expected to more than offset the corresponding reduction in expensed subscriber
acquisition costs, and result in an overall increase in cash used to acquire
subscribers during 2004.
Our subscriber acquisition costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new
subscriber basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we
introduce more aggressive promotions in response to new promotions offered by
our competitors.

Maintain or improve operating margins.

We will continue to work to generate
cost savings by improving our operating efficiency and attempting to control
rising programming costs.
Our operating margins may be adversely impacted by rising programming costs.
Payments we make to programmers for programming content represent one of the
largest components of our operating costs. We expect programming providers to
continue to demand higher rates for their programming. We will continue to
negotiate aggressively with programming providers in an effort to control
rising programming costs. However, there can be no assurance we will be
successful in controlling these costs. In addition, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to increase the price of our programming to offset these
programming rate increases without affecting the competitiveness of our
programming packages.

Financial Statement Restatement

During February 2004, we consulted with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) regarding our accrual for the replacement of smart cards. Those cards,
which provide security that only paying customers can receive programming
delivered by us, become obsolete as a result of piracy. During the consultation process, the
SEC informed us that it believes we over reserved approximately $30.2 million
for the replacement of certain smart cards. During prior years, ending in 2002,
we accrued the estimated cost to replace those cards, which are included in
satellite receivers that we sell and lease to consumers. The SEC did not object
to the accruals to replace the smart cards in satellite receivers sold to and
owned by consumers. However, the SEC believes that we over reserved
approximately $30.2 million, on a pre-tax basis, for the replacement of smart
cards in satellite receivers owned by us and leased to consumers.

On March 12, 2004, the SEC informed us it would not object if we restated our
financial statements for 2002 to record a reversal of the accruals for the
replacement of these smart cards of approximately $4.2 million, $17.2 million
and $8.8 million which were originally accrued in 2000, 2001 and from January 2002 through June
2002, respectively. As a result, we have restated our financial statements for
2002 to reduce previously reported Subscriber related expenses, operating
losses and pre-tax losses by approximately $30.2 million.

Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items

Subscription
television services revenue

.

“

Subscription television services
revenue” consists principally of revenue from basic, movie, local,
international and pay-per-view subscription television services, as well as
rental and additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple set-top boxes.

DTH equipment sales

. “DTH equipment sales” consist of sales of digital
set-top boxes by our ETC subsidiary to Bell ExpressVu, a DBS service provider
in Canada. “DTH equipment sales” also include sales of DBS accessories to DISH
Network subscribers and to retailers and other distributors of our equipment.

Subscriber-related expenses

. “Subscriber-related expenses” include costs
incurred in the operation of our DISH Network customer service centers,
programming expenses, copyright royalties, residual commissions, and billing,
lockbox and other variable subscriber expenses. “Subscriber-related expenses”
also include costs related to subscriber retention.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Satellite and transmission expenses

. “Satellite and transmission expenses”
include costs associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers,
the transmission of local channels, contracted satellite telemetry, tracking
and control services and transponder leases.

Cost of sales – DTH equipment.

“Cost of sales – DTH equipment” principally
includes costs associated with digital set-top boxes and related components
sold to Bell ExpressVu and sales of DBS accessories to DISH Network subscribers
and to retailers and other distributors of our equipment.

Subscriber acquisition costs

. Generally, under most promotions, we subsidize
the installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems
in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our “Subscriber acquisition
costs” include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and
other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly
by us to subscribers, net costs related to our free installation promotions and
other promotional incentives, and costs related to acquisition advertising. We
exclude equipment capitalized under our equipment lease promotion from our
calculation of “Subscriber acquisition costs.” We also exclude payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion
subscribers from our calculation of “Subscriber acquisition costs.”

SAC.

SAC, which represents total subscriber acquisition costs stated on a per
subscriber basis, is calculated by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs
for a period by the number of gross new subscribers acquired during the period.
We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating SAC and believe
presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies
in the same or similar businesses.

General
and administrative expenses.

“General and administrative expenses”
primarily includes employee-related costs associated with administrative
services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance. It also
includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and
building maintenance expense and other items associated with the administration
of the company.

Interest expense

.

“Interest expense” primarily includes interest expense,
prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our
high yield and convertible debt securities, net of capitalized interest.

Other

.

The main components of “Other” income and expense are equity in
earnings of our affiliates and gains and losses on the sale of investments or
impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)

.
EBITDA is defined as “Net income (loss)” plus “Interest expense” net of
“Interest income”, “Taxes” and “Depreciation and amortization”. Effective
January 1, 2003, we include “Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense” in our
definition of EBITDA. Effective April 1, 2003, we include “Other income and
expense” items and “Change in valuation of contingent value rights” in our
definition of EBITDA. All prior amounts conform to the current presentation.

DISH Network Subscribers.

The total number of DISH Network subscribers
includes only those subscribers who are actively subscribing to the DISH
Network service.

Monthly average revenue per subscriber (“ARPU”)

. Average monthly revenue per
subscriber, or ARPU, is calculated by dividing average monthly revenues for the
period (total revenues during the period divided by the number of months in the
period) by average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average
subscribers are calculated for the year and the period by adding the average
subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period.
Average subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and
ending subscribers for the month and dividing by two. We are not aware of any
uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may
not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar
businesses.

Monthly subscriber churn/subscriber turnover

. We calculate percentage monthly
churn by dividing the number of subscribers who terminate service during the
month by total subscribers as of the beginning of the month. We are not aware
of any uniform standards for calculating churn and believe presentations of
churn may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or
similar businesses.

Free Cash Flow

.

We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating
activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment”, as shown on our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We restated our 2002 consolidated financial statements to reverse an
accrual of approximately $30.2 million, on a pre-tax basis, related to the
replacement of smart cards in satellite receivers owned by us and leased
to consumers. See Note 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

DISH Network subscribers

. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 9.425
million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 8.180 million at
December 31, 2002, an increase of approximately 15.2%. DISH Network added
approximately 1.245 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to approximately 1.350 million net new subscribers during the
same period in 2002. We believe the reduction in net new subscribers for the
year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the same period in 2002, resulted
from a number of factors, including stronger competition from advanced digital
cable and cable modems. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base
continues to increase, even if percentage churn remains constant, increasing
numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth.

Subscriber additions during the second half of 2003 were negatively impacted by
delays in the delivery of several newly developed products in the third and
fourth quarter of 2003. These delays resulted in a temporary product shortage,
which continued into the first quarter of 2004, and further resulted in
continuing product installation delays. Product shortages and installation
delays could cause us to lose potential future subscribers to our DISH Network
service. Although there can be no assurance, the temporary product shortage
and resulting installation delays currently are not expected to materially
impact 2004 overall net subscriber additions.

During March 2004, we were unable to reach an acceptable agreement with Viacom
to renew our contracts to carry CBS owned and operated local stations and cable
channels and we therefore stopped distributing those Viacom channels for
approximately two days. This dispute has since been resolved. As a result of
this dispute, we will have a temporary increase in subscriber churn during the
first quarter of 2004. While there can be no assurance, the Viacom dispute is
not expected to have a material effect on overall net subscriber additions in
2004.

Subscription television services revenue.

DISH Network “Subscription
television services” revenue totaled $5.399 billion for the year ended December
31, 2003, an increase of $987.5 million or 22.4% compared to the same period in
2002. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network
subscriber growth and the 2003 price increase discussed in “ARPU” below. The
increase in “Subscription television services” revenue was partially offset by
our free and reduced price programming promotions, discussed in “New subscriber
promotions” below. DISH Network “Subscription television services” revenue
will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in increasing the
number of DISH Network subscribers and maintaining or increasing revenue per
subscriber.

We provided credits to some of our subscribers to compensate them for the
temporary removal of the Viacom programming discussed above. The majority of
our customers received a $1.00 credit. Approximately 1.7 million of our
subscribers who are in CBS markets owned and operated by Viacom received $2.00
credits. On average, our subscriber base received a credit of slightly over
$1.00. These credits will have the effect of reducing operating margins,
earnings and free cash flow during the first quarter of 2004, but are not
expected to have a material impact on overall 2004 results.

ARPU

. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately $51.11 during
the year ended December 31, 2003 and approximately $49.17 during the same
period in 2002. The $1.94 increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber
is primarily attributable to price increases of up to $2.00 in February 2003,
the increased availability of local channels by satellite and an increase in
subscribers with multiple set-top boxes. These increases were partially offset
by certain subscriber promotions, discussed in “New subscriber promotions”
below, under which new subscribers received free programming for the first
three months of their term of service, and other promotions under which
subscribers received discounted programming. While there can be no assurance,
notwithstanding the anticipated impact of the credits for the Viacom dispute
discussed above and the potential impact of the network litigation and “must
carry” rules discussed below, we expect ARPU to continue to increase due to
price increases, availability of local channels by satellite in more markets,
increased programming and interactive services, and the discontinuance of free
and discounted programming promotions.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing
the delivery of superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate
delivery of network channels and superstations to a substantial number of our
subscribers, which could cause many of those customers to cancel their
subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds
the Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt
to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network
channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where available,
and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict
with any degree of certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their
primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant
network



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all
subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we
are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result in a
reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a temporary increase in
churn.

In April 2002, the FCC concluded that our “must carry” implementation methods
were not in compliance with the “must carry” rules. If the FCC finds our
subsequent remedial actions unsatisfactory, while we would attempt to continue
providing local network channels in all markets without interruption, we could
be forced by capacity constraints to reduce the number of markets in which we
provide local channels. This could cause a temporary increase in churn and a
small reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber.

DTH equipment sales

. For the year ended December 31, 2003, “DTH equipment
sales” totaled $244.1 million, a decrease of $43.7 million compared to the same
period during 2002. The decrease in “DTH equipment sales” principally resulted
from a decline in the number of digital set-top boxes sold to Bell ExpressVu.

We currently have certain binding purchase orders and a minimum volume
commitment from Bell ExpressVu for 2004, and we are actively trying to secure
new orders from other potential international customers. However, we cannot
guarantee at this time that those negotiations will be successful. A
significant portion of our future DTH equipment revenue depends largely on the
success of Bell ExpressVu and other international operators, which in turn,
depends on other factors, such as the level of consumer acceptance of
direct-to-home satellite TV products and the increasing intensity of
competition for international subscription television subscribers.

Subscriber-related expenses

.

“Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $2.708
billion during the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $507.7 million
or 23.1% compared to the same period in 2002. The increase in
“Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to the increase in the
number of DISH Network subscribers. This growth resulted in increased expenses
to support the DISH Network, including programming costs, personnel expenses,
the opening of a new call center, and increased operating expenses related to
the expansion of our DISH Network Service LLC business. “Subscriber-related
expenses” represented 50.2% and 49.9% of “Subscription television services”
revenue during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
increase in “Subscriber-related expenses” as a percentage of “Subscription
television services revenue” primarily resulted from the previously discussed
smart card accrual reversal in 2002. This accrual reversal decreased the 2002
expense to revenue ratio from 50.6% to 49.9%. The increase in the expense to
revenue ratio from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by an increase in monthly
average revenue per subscriber and increased operating efficiencies.

During 2003 and 2002, we offered various programs to existing subscribers
including programs for new and upgraded equipment. We generally subsidize
installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receivers pursuant to
our subscriber retention programs. Costs related to subscriber retention
programs are expected to materially increase in the future as we introduce more
aggressive subscriber retention programs to reduce subscriber churn, to respond
to competition and for other reasons.

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with
programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us
to only make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the
respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will
continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber
base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content,
there can be no assurance that our “Subscriber-related expenses” as a
percentage of “Subscription television services revenue” will not materially
increase without corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming
packages.

Satellite and transmission expenses

. “Satellite and transmission expenses”
totaled $79.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, a $17.2 million
increase compared to the same period in 2002. This increase primarily resulted
from launch and operational costs associated with the increasing number of
markets in which we offer local network channels by satellite. During 2003, we
launched 47 additional local markets compared to the launch of 18 additional
markets during 2002. “Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled 1.5% and
1.4% of “Subscription television services” revenue during each of the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These expenses will increase
further in the future to the extent we successfully obtain commercial in-orbit
satellite insurance and to the



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

extent we increase the operations at our digital broadcast centers as, among
other things, additional satellites are placed in service and additional local
markets and other programming services are launched.

Cost of sales – DTH equipment

.

“Cost of sales – DTH equipment” totaled $150.6
million during the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $28.0 million
compared to the same period in 2002. This decrease related primarily to a
decrease in sales of digital set-top boxes to Bell ExpressVu. “Cost of sales –
DTH equipment” during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 include
non-recurring reductions in the cost of set-top box equipment of approximately
$6.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. “Cost of sales — DTH equipment”
represented 61.7% and 62.0% of “DTH equipment sales”, during the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Subscriber acquisition costs

.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, our
subscriber acquisition costs totaled approximately $1.312 billion, or
approximately $453 per new subscriber activation. Comparatively, our subscriber
acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled approximately
$1.169 billion, or approximately $421 per new subscriber activation. The
increase principally resulted from the sale of equipment at little or no cost
to the subscriber, including our promotion in which subscribers are eligible to
receive up to three free receivers or a free digital video recorder, together
with a decrease in subscriber equipment leases. The increase also resulted
from an increase in acquisition marketing in 2003 compared to 2002. This
increase was partially offset by benefits of approximately $77.2 million which
were recorded in 2003. These benefits include approximately $34.4 million
related to the receipt of a reimbursement payment for previously sold set-top
box equipment pursuant to a litigation settlement and approximately $42.8
million related to a reduction in the cost of set-top box equipment resulting
from a change in estimated royalty obligations. Subscriber acquisition costs
during the year ended December 31, 2002 include a non-recurring reduction in
the cost of set-top box equipment of approximately $47.7 million as a result of
favorable litigation developments and the completion of royalty arrangements
with more favorable terms than estimated amounts previously accrued. Our
subscriber acquisition costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new subscriber
activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we
introduce other more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are
necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our equipment lease promotion from our
calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion
subscribers from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. See further
discussion of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs and payments and certain
returned equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion subscribers
included in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subscriber acquisition costs.”
As a result of recent changes in our equipment lease promotion, in
2004 we anticipate an increase in the number of subscribers who lease
rather than purchase equipment. The resulting anticipated increase in
capitalized costs is expected to more than offset the corresponding
reduction in expensed subscriber acquisition costs, and result in an
overall increase in cash used to acquire subscribers during 2004.

New subscriber promotions

–

As previously discussed, our Subscriber
acquisitions costs include, among other things, net costs related to our new
subscriber promotions. During the year ended December 31, 2003, our
significant new subscriber promotions were as follows:

Free Dish –

Effective February 1, 2003, our Free DISH promotion provides new
subscribers with a choice of up to two EchoStar receivers, including one
premium model system, and free installation for $49.99. The subscriber receives
a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill. To be eligible, subscribers must
provide a valid major credit card, their social security number, pass a credit
score, and make a one-year commitment to subscribe to a qualified programming
package. Effective August 24, 2003, we expanded the above offer to include up
to three EchoStar receivers and require either a one or two year programming
commitment, depending on the set-top box models selected by the subscriber.
Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Free Dish
promotion, we expect it to continue through at least June 30, 2004.

Free for All

–

Effective February 1, 2003, our Free for All promotion provides
new subscribers who purchase up to two receivers for $149 or more, depending on
the models chosen, and subscribe to a qualifying programming package, free
installation, together with credits of $12.50 or $17.00 applied to their
programming bill each month for a year. Effective August 24, 2003, under our
Free for All promotion new subscribers who purchase one or two receiver systems
and subscribe to a qualifying programming package receive a monthly credit of
$10.00 for 15 or 20 months, respectively. Although there can be no assurance
as to the ultimate duration of the Free for All promotion, we expect it to
continue through at least June 30, 2004.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Digital Home Plan

–

Effective February 1, 2003, our Digital Home Plan promotion
offered new subscribers up to four EchoStar receivers, including various
models, with a minimum required programming package subscription. Each plan
includes in-home service, and the consumer must agree to a one-year commitment,
provide a valid major credit card, have an acceptable credit score, incur a
one-time set-up fee of $49.99, and an optional $50.00 upgrade fee. The
subscriber receives a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill. Effective
November 15, 2003, for an optional $99.00 upgrade fee or a two-year programming
commitment, we offered new subscribers an option to connect up to three
EchoStar receivers to up to four televisions. Since we retain ownership of
equipment installed pursuant to the Digital Home Plan promotion, equipment
costs are capitalized and depreciated over a period of approximately four
years. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of our
current equipment lease promotion, we expect it to continue through at least
June 30, 2004.

Free Installation

–

Under our free installation program all subscribers who
purchase an EchoStar receiver system are eligible to receive free professional
installation of up to two receivers. Although there can be no assurance as to
the ultimate duration of the Free Installation promotion, we expect it to
continue through at least June 30, 2004.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative expenses”
totaled $332.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of
$12.8 million compared to the same period in 2002. The increase in “General
and administrative expenses” was primarily attributable to increased personnel
and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network.
“General and administrative expenses” represented 5.8% and 6.6% of “Total
revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This
decrease in “General and administrative expenses” as a percent of “Total
revenue” was the result of increased operational efficiencies.

Non-cash, stock-based compensation

.

During 1999, we adopted an incentive plan
under our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, which provided certain key employees with
incentives including stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2003,
we recognized $3.5 million of compensation under this performance-based plan, a
decrease of $7.7 million compared to the same period in 2002. This decrease
was primarily attributable to proportionate vesting and stock option
forfeitures resulting from employee terminations. The remaining deferred
compensation of $1.2 million as of December 31, 2003, which will be reduced by
future forfeitures, if any, will be recognized over the remaining vesting
period, ending on March 31, 2004.

We report all non-cash compensation based on stock option appreciation as a
single expense category in our accompanying statements of operations. The
following table represents the other expense categories in our statements of
operations that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based compensation was
allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation for key
employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan:

In addition, options to purchase 8.0 million shares were outstanding under our
long-term incentive plan as of December 31, 2003. These options were granted
with exercise prices at least equal to the market value of the underlying
shares on the dates they were issued during 1999, 2000 and 2001. The
weighted-average exercise price of these options is $9.05. Vesting of these
options is contingent upon meeting certain longer-term goals which have not yet
been achieved. Consequently, no compensation was recorded during the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 related to these long-term options. We will
record the related compensation when achievement of the performance goals
becomes probable, if ever. Such compensation, if recorded, would likely result
in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in our statements of
operations.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Depreciation and amortization

.

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled
$398.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, a $25.2 million
increase compared to the same period in 2002. The increase in “Depreciation
and amortization” expense principally resulted from an increase in depreciation
related to the commencement of commercial operation of EchoStar VII, VIII and
IX in April 2002, October 2002, and October 2003, respectively, and leased
equipment and other additional depreciable assets placed in service during
2003.

Interest income

.

“Interest income” totaled $65.1 million during the year ended
December 31, 2003, a decrease of $47.9 million compared to the same period in
2002. This decrease principally resulted from lower returns and lower cash and
marketable investment securities balances in 2003 as compared to 2002.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized

.

“Interest expense” totaled
$552.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $69.6
million compared to the same period in 2002. This increase primarily resulted
from prepayment premiums and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs
totaling approximately $97.1 million related to the full and partial
redemptions and repurchases of certain of our debt securities, as discussed
further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and additional interest expense
totaling approximately $43.0 million related to our $500.0 million convertible
notes offering and our $2.5 billion senior notes offering during July and
October 2003, respectively. This increase also resulted from a $15.4 million
reduction in the amount of interest capitalized during the year ended December
31, 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002. Interest is capitalized
during the construction phase of a satellite, however, capitalization of
additional interest ceases upon commercial operation of the satellite.
Therefore, once EchoStar VII, EchoStar VIII and EchoStar IX commenced
commercial operation during April 2002, October 2002 and August 2003,
respectively, we ceased capitalizing interest related to these satellites. The
expensing of this previously capitalized interest resulted in an increase in
“Interest expense”. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in
interest expense of approximately $52.4 million as a result of the debt
redemptions and repurchases discussed above. In addition, “Interest expense”
for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes approximately $31.1 million
related to our 2002 bridge financing commitments.

Merger termination related expenses

.

The $689.8 million decrease in “Merger
termination related expenses” is attributable to costs expensed during 2002
upon termination of our proposed merger with Hughes, which consists of a $600.0
million termination fee paid to Hughes, $56.5 million of previously capitalized
merger costs and $33.3 million of fees paid in connection with merger financing
activities.

Other

. “Other” income (expense) totaled $18.8 million during the year ended
December 31, 2003, compared to $(170.7) million during the same period in 2002.
This improvement principally resulted from net gains on marketable and
non-marketable investment securities of approximately $19.8 million recorded in
2003 compared to net losses of approximately $135.6 million recorded in 2002.
This improvement also resulted from the absence during 2003 of any net change
in valuation of contingent value rights, which totaled $19.7 million during the
year ended December 31, 2002. Our Series D convertible preferred stock was
repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2002.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

. EBITDA was
$1.125 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to a negative
$2.7 million during the same period in 2002. The improvement was primarily
attributable to a reduction in “Other” expense totaling $761.8 million, the
components of which are discussed above, as well as the increase in the number
of DISH Network subscribers, which continues to result in revenue sufficient to
support the cost of new and existing subscribers. The improvement was
partially offset by a decrease in subscribers leasing equipment and a
corresponding increase in equipment subsidies compared to the same period in
2002, as well as a decrease in “DTH equipment sales”. EBITDA does not include
the impact of capital expenditures under our equipment lease promotion of
approximately $108.1 million and $277.6 million during 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As previously discussed, to the extent we introduce more
aggressive marketing promotions and our subscriber acquisition costs materially
increase, our EBITDA results will be negatively impacted because subscriber
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered
a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined
in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating
efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful
measure for those evaluating companies in the multi-channel video programming
distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income
generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund
capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net income (loss)

.

“Net income” was $224.5 million during the year ended
December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.077 billion compared to a “Net loss” of
$852.0 million for the same period in 2002. The improvement was primarily
attributable to an increase in “Operating income” and an improvement in “Other
income and expense”, the components of which are discussed above. Our future
net income (loss) results will be negatively impacted to the extent we
introduce more aggressive marketing promotions that materially increase our
subscriber acquisition costs since these subscriber acquisition costs are
generally expensed as incurred.

Net income (loss) to common shareholders

.

“Net income to common shareholders”
was $224.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, an improvement of
$639.1 million compared to “Net loss to common shareholders” of $414.6 million
for the same period in 2002. The improvement is primarily attributable to the
improvement in “Net loss”, discussed above. The improvement was partially
offset by a $437.4 million gain on the redemption of Series D convertible
preferred stock from Vivendi during 2002.

Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

DISH Network subscribers.

DISH Network added approximately 1.350 million net
new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to approximately
1.570 million net new subscribers during the same period in 2001. We believe
the reduction in net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2002,
compared to the same period in 2001, resulted from a number of factors,
including the continued weak U.S. economy and stronger competition from
advanced digital cable and cable modems. Additionally, as the size of our
subscriber base continues to increase, even if percentage churn remains
constant, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain
net subscriber growth. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 8.180
million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 6.830 million at
December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately 19.8%.

Subscription television services revenue

. DISH Network “Subscription television
services” revenue totaled $4.412 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002,
an increase of $823.4 million or 22.9% compared to the same period in 2001.
This increase was attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth.

ARPU

. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was approximately $49.17 during
the year ended December 31, 2002 and approximately $49.32 during the same
period in 2001. The decrease in monthly average revenue per subscriber is
primarily attributable to certain promotions, discussed below, under which new
subscribers received free programming for the first three months of their term
of service, and other promotions under which subscribers received discounted
programming for 12 months. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.00 price
increase in February 2002, the increased availability of local channels by
satellite and an increase in subscribers with multiple set-top boxes.

DTH equipment sales

. For the year ended December 31, 2002, “DTH equipment
sales” totaled $287.8 million, an increase of $16.6 million compared to the
same period during 2001. The increase in “DTH equipment sales” principally
resulted from an increase in sales of DBS accessories to DISH Network
subscribers. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of
digital set-top boxes to our international DTH customers.

Subscriber-related expenses

. “Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $2.200
billion during the year ended December, 2002, an increase of $407.7 million
compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in total “Subscriber-related
expenses” is primarily attributable to the increase in DISH Network
subscribers. This growth resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH
Network, including programming costs, personnel and telephone expenses, the
opening of a new call center, increased operating expenses related to the
expansion of our DISH Network Service LLC business, increased competition and
increased costs due to second-dish installations in order to meet the demands
of “must carry”.

These expenses represented 49.9% and 50.0% of “Subscription television
services” revenues during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. This decrease primarily resulted from a variety of factors
including $1.00 price increase in February 2002, the increased availability of
local channels by satellite in 2002 and an increase in subscribers with
multiple set-top boxes. This decrease also resulted from the previously
discussed smart card accrual reversal in 2002. This accrual reversal decreased
the 2002 expense to revenue ratio from 50.6% to 49.9%. This decrease was
offset by the decrease in ARPU resulting from promotions under which
subscribers received free or discounted programming in 2002 as compared to
2001.

Satellite and transmission expenses

. “Satellite and transmission” expenses
totaled $62.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a $21.2 million
increase compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “Satellite and
transmission” expenses primarily resulted from increased operations at our
digital broadcast centers in order to meet the demands of current “must carry”
requirements and the launch of 18 additional local markets during the year
ended December 31, 2002. “Satellite and transmission” expenses totaled 1.4%
and 1.1% of “Subscription television services” revenue during the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Cost of sales – DTH equipment

.

“Cost of sales – DTH equipment” totaled $178.6
million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $9.5 million
compared to the same period in 2001. “Cost of sales — DTH equipment”
represented 62.0% and 69.3% of “DTH equipment sales”, during the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease, both in aggregate and
as a percentage of revenue, related primarily to reductions in the cost of
set-top box equipment and increased sales of higher margin DBS accessories.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Subscriber acquisition costs

. During the year ended December 31, 2002, our
subscriber acquisition costs totaled approximately $1.169 billion, or
approximately $421 per new subscriber activation. Comparatively, our subscriber
acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately
$1.081 billion, or approximately $395 per new subscriber activation. Total
subscriber acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 include
favorable adjustments which reduced the costs related to the production of
EchoStar receiver systems. During 2002, we recorded adjustments of
approximately $47.7 million as a result of favorable litigation developments
and the completion of royalty arrangements with more favorable terms than
estimated amounts previously accrued. The increase in total subscriber
acquisition costs primarily resulted from an increase in “Other subscriber
promotion subsidies” related to additional subsidies on second receiver
installations and a decrease in the sales price of manufactured equipment, as
well as an increase in “Subscriber acquisition advertising” related to
acquisition marketing and our 2002 marketing promotions. A decrease in
equipment leasing in 2002 as compared to 2001 also contributed to this
increase. This increase was partially offset by reductions in the cost of
manufactured equipment and an increase in installations we perform on behalf of
retailers.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our equipment lease promotion from our
calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude payments and
certain returned equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion
subscribers from our calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. Equipment
capitalized under our equipment lease promotion totaled approximately $277.6
million and $337.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Payments and returned equipment received from disconnecting
lease promotion subscribers, which became available for sale through other
promotions rather than being redeployed in the equipment lease promotion,
totaled approximately $37.8 million and $15.7 million during the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

General and administrative expenses

.

“General and administrative” expenses
totaled $319.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of
$14.2 million compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “General
and administrative” expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel
and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses and litigation
settlements. “General and administrative” expenses represented 6.6% and 7.6%
of “Total revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Non-cash, stock-based compensation

.

During the year ended December 31, 2002,
we recognized $11.3 million of compensation under our performance-based plan, a
decrease of $8.9 million compared to the same period in 2001. This decrease is
primarily attributable to proportionate vesting and stock option forfeitures.

We report all non-cash compensation based on stock option appreciation as a
single expense category in our accompanying statements of operations. The
following table represents the other expense categories in our statements of
operations that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based compensation was
allocated to the same expense categories as the base compensation for key
employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan:

Depreciation and amortization

“Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled
$373.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, a $94.3 million
increase compared to the same period in 2001. The increase in “Depreciation
and amortization” expense principally resulted from an increase in depreciation
related to the commencement of commercial operation of EchoStar VII in April
2002, commencement of commercial operations of EchoStar VIII in
October 2002 and leased equipment and other additional depreciable assets
placed in service. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of
approximately $18.8 million of amortization expense as a result of our adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“FAS 142”). In
accordance with FAS 142, effective January 2002 we ceased amortization of our
FCC authorizations.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Other income and expense

.

“Other expense,” net, totaled $1.230 billion during
the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $804.1 million compared to the
same period in 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to costs expensed
upon termination of the merger of approximately $689.8 million, which consist
of a $600.0 million termination fee paid to Hughes, $56.5 million of previously
capitalized merger costs and $33.3 million of fees paid in connection with
merger financing activities. The increase also resulted from an increase in
“Other” related to net losses on marketable and non-marketable investment
securities of approximately $135.6 million recorded in 2002 compared to
approximately $110.5 million recorded in 2001 and net charges of approximately
$19.7 million relating to the Vivendi contingent value rights which were
outstanding during a portion of 2002. The increase in “Other expense” was
partially offset by a decrease in equity losses of affiliates. “Interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized” increased as a result of the issuance of
our 9 1/8% Senior Notes in December 2001, the issuance of our 5 3/4%
Convertible Subordinated Notes in May 2001 and interest costs related to our
merger financing activities. “Interest income” increased as a result of higher
cash balances in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

.

EBITDA was a
negative $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to
$338.3 million during the same period in 2001. This decrease was mainly
attributable to the merger related expenses recorded in 2002 offset by an
increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, resulting in recurring
revenue which was large enough to support the cost of new and existing
subscribers, together with the introduction of our equipment lease promotion in
July 2000. EBITDA does not include the impact of amounts capitalized under
our equipment lease promotion of approximately $277.6 million and $337.7
million during 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Net loss

.

“Net loss” was $852.0 million during the year ended December 31,
2002, an increase of $636.5 million compared to “Net loss” of $215.5 million
for the same period in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an
increase in “Other income (expense)” discussed above. The increase in net loss
was partially offset by an improvement in “Operating income (loss),” the
components of which are discussed above.

Net loss to common shareholders

.

“Net loss to common shareholders” was $414.6
million during the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $198.8 million
compared to “Net loss to common shareholders” of $215.8 million for the same
period in 2001. The



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

increase is primarily attributable to the increase in “Net
loss”, discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a $437.4 million
gain on the redemption of Series D convertible preferred stock from Vivendi.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our sources of liquidity during 2003 were cash generated from operating
activities and proceeds from the July and October issuances of long-term debt.
Proceeds from these issuances were used, in part, to repay higher interest
long-term notes. See further discussion of 2003 financings in “Cash flows from
financing activities” below.

We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service
requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment
balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive
future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our
ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving any or all of our goals. The amount of
capital required to fund our 2004 working capital and capital expenditure needs
will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new
subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including
capitalized costs associated with our equipment lease promotion. The amount of
capital required in 2004 will also depend on our levels of investment in
infrastructure necessary to support additional local markets and broadband and
other initiatives. We currently anticipate that 2004 capital expenditures will
be significantly higher than 2003 capital expenditures of $321.8 million. Our
capital expenditures will also vary depending on the number of satellites under
construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure
requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition
for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, or in
the event of continued general economic downturn, among other factors. These
factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. The
following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities.

We consider all
liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash
equivalents. See “Item 7A. – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk” for further discussion regarding our marketable investment
securities. As of December 31, 2003, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash
equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $4.170 billion,
including $176.8 million of cash reserved for satellite insurance and
approximately $20.0 million of other restricted cash and marketable investment
securities, compared to $2.848 billion, including $151.4 million of cash
reserved for satellite insurance and $10.0 million of other restricted cash, as
of December 31, 2002. As previously discussed, effective February 2, 2004,
EDBS redeemed the remainder of its 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and, as such,
EDBS has been discharged and released from their obligations under the related
indenture. This redemption reduced our unrestricted cash by approximately
$1.490 billion. As an indirect result of this redemption, during February
2004, we were able to reclassify approximately $57.2 million representing the
depreciated cost of two of our satellites from cash reserved for satellite
insurance to cash and cash equivalents.

Free Cash Flow.

We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric
because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that
is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of
property and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in
accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating
income”, “Net income”, “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other
measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP liquidity
measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of
“Net cash flows from operating activities” because free cash flow includes
investments in operational assets. Free cash flow does not represent residual
cash available for discretionary expenditures, since it excludes cash required
for debt service. Free cash flow also excludes cash which may be necessary for
acquisitions, investments and other needs that may arise.

Free cash flow was $253.8 million, negative $369.1 million and negative $148.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The increase from 2002 to 2003 of approximately $622.8 million resulted from an
increase in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of approximately $508.8
million and a decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” of
approximately $114.0 million. The increase in “Net cash flows from operating
activities” is primarily attributable to an improvement in net income, as
discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the
same period in 2002. The improvement in net income was offset by significantly
less cash flow generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities in
2003 as compared to 2002. Cash flow from changes in operating assets



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

and
liabilities was negative $75.7 million during 2003 compared to $183.0 million
during 2002. This decrease includes a $50.0 million satellite
prepayment to SES Americom in 2003 that is included in “Other non-current
assets” (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion). This decrease also includes an increased use of cash
related to reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of the timing
of certain payments. The decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” was
primarily attributable to reduced spending on the construction of satellites
and the capitalization of less equipment under our lease promotion.

The decrease from 2001 to 2002 of approximately $221.1 million resulted from a
decrease in “Net cash flows from operating activities” of approximately $422.7
million and a decrease in “Purchases of property and equipment” of
approximately $201.6 million. The decrease in “Net cash flows from operating
activities” is primarily attributable to an increase in net losses, as
discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, and a decrease in cash flow generated from changes in
operating assets and liabilities in 2002 as compared to 2001. Cash flow from
changes in operating assets and liabilities was $183.0 million during 2002
compared to $215.4 million during 2001. The following table reconciles free
cash flow to “Net cash flows from operating activities”.

During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, free cash flow was
significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown
in the “Net cash flows from operating activities” section of our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability
balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no
assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material
changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these
changes depend upon, among other things, management’s timing of payments and
receipts and inventory levels. In addition to fluctuations resulting from
changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary
significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things,
subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition
costs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property
and equipment and other factors.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing
the delivery of superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate
delivery of network channels and superstations to a substantial number of our
subscribers, which could cause many of those customers to cancel their
subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds
the Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt
to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network
channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where available,
and free off air antenna
offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict with any degree of
certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their primary DISH
Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all
subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we
are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result in a
reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a temporary increase in
churn. Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending
on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors.

Cash flows from operating activities.

We reinvest the cash flow from operating
activities in our business. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $575.6 million,
$66.7 million and $489.5 million, respectively. See discussion of changes in
net cash flows from operating activities included in “Free cash flow” above.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Cash flows from investing activities.

We reinvest cash in our business
primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we reported net cash flows
from investing activities of negative $1.762 billion, negative $682.4 million
and negative $1.279 billion, respectively. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 of
approximately $1.079 billion primarily resulted from an increase in net
purchases of marketable investment securities related to the investment of the
net proceeds from our 2003 financings discussed below. In addition, cash flows
from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes cash
used for merger-related costs of approximately $38.6 million. The decrease in
net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by a decrease in
purchases of property and equipment driven by reduced spending on the
construction of satellites and capitalization of less equipment under our
equipment lease promotion in 2003 as compared to 2002.

The improvement from 2001 to 2002 of approximately $596.7 million resulted from
a decrease in net purchases of marketable investment securities related to the
investment of net proceeds from our 2001 financings discussed below. The
increase also resulted from a decrease in purchases of property and equipment
driven by reduced spending on the construction of satellites and capitalization
of less equipment under our equipment lease promotion in 2002 as compared to
2001. In addition, cash flows from investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2001 includes cash used for our additional $50.0 million
investment in StarBand Communications.

Cash flows from financing activities.

Our financing activities include net
proceeds and cash outlays related to the issuance and repayments of long-term
debt and mortgages and other notes payable, and repurchases of our class A
common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we
reported net cash flows from financing activities of $994.1 million, $420.8
million and $1.611 billion, respectively. The increase from 2002 to 2003 of
approximately $573.2 million principally resulted from the following 2003
financing activities:

•

On July 21, 2003, we sold a $500.0 million 3% Convertible
Subordinated Note due 2010 to SBC Communications, Inc.

•

On October 2, 2003, our subsidiary EDBS sold (i) $1,000,000,000
principal amount of its 5 3/4% Senior Notes due October 1, 2008; (ii)
$1,000,000,000 principal amount of its 6 3/8% Senior Notes due October
1, 2011; and (iii) $500,000,000 principal amount of its Floating Rate
Senior Notes due October 1, 2008.

This increase from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by the following financing
uses of cash:

This increase from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by the net cash received
from the issuance and subsequent repurchase of our Series D convertible
preferred stock during 2002.

The decrease from 2001 to 2002 of approximately $1.190 billion principally
resulted from the following 2001 financing activities:

•

On May 24, 2001, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of the 5
3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008.

•

On December 28, 2001, EDBS sold $700.0 million principal amount of
the 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009.

This decrease from 2001 to 2002 was partially offset by the net cash received
from the issuance and subsequent repurchase of our Series D convertible
preferred stock.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Other Liquidity Items

Subscriber turnover.

If a subscriber disconnects, or churns, from our DISH
Network service there is an immediate impact to our ongoing revenue stream. In
addition, if a subscriber churns early in the average subscriber life-cycle, we
cannot recover the costs related to the acquisition of the subscriber. Our
percentage monthly churn for the year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately
1.57%, compared to our percentage churn for the same period in 2002 of
approximately 1.59%. As a result of our dispute with Viacom, as previously described, we will have a
temporary increase in subscriber churn during the first quarter of 2004. While
there can be no assurance, the Viacom dispute is not expected to have a
material effect on overall net subscriber additions in 2004.

Impacts from our litigation with the networks in Florida, FCC rules governing
the delivery of superstations and other factors could cause us to terminate
delivery of network channels and superstations to a substantial number of our
subscribers, which could cause many of those customers to cancel their
subscription to our other services. In the event the Court of Appeals upholds
the Miami District Court’s network litigation injunction, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt
to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network
channels including migration to local channels by satellite where available,
and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict
with any degree of certainty how many subscribers might ultimately cancel their
primary DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant
network channels. We could be required to terminate distant network
programming to all subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their
cross-appeal and we are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant
network channels. Termination of distant network programming to subscribers
would result in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in churn.

Increases in piracy or theft of our signal, or our competitors’ signals, also
could cause churn to increase in future periods. In addition, in April 2002,
the FCC concluded that our “must carry” implementation methods were not in
compliance with the “must carry” rules. If the FCC finds our subsequent
remedial actions unsatisfactory, while we would attempt to continue providing
local network channels in all markets without interruption, we could be forced
by capacity constraints to reduce the number of markets in which we provide
local channels. This could cause a temporary increase in churn and a small
reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber. Additionally, as the size
of our subscriber base continues to increase, even if percentage churn remains
constant, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain
net subscriber growth.

Subscriber acquisition and retention costs.

As previously described, we
generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar
receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our
spending for subscriber acquisition costs, and to a lesser extent subscriber
retention costs, can vary significantly from period to period and can cause
material variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow. Our average
subscriber acquisition costs were approximately $453 per new subscriber
activation during the year ended December 31, 2003. While there can be no
assurance, we believe continued tightening of credit requirements, together
with promotions tailored towards subscribers with multiple receivers and
advanced products, will attract better long-term subscribers. Our subscriber
acquisition costs, both in the aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation
basis may materially increase in future periods to the extent that we introduce
more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond
to competition, or for other reasons.

We exclude equipment capitalized under our lease promotion from our calculation
of subscriber acquisition costs. We also exclude payments and certain returned
equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion subscribers from our
calculation of subscriber acquisition costs. Equipment capitalized under our
lease promotion totaled approximately $108.1 million, $277.6 million and $337.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Returned equipment received from disconnecting lease promotion subscribers,
which became available for sale rather than being redeployed through the lease
promotion, together with payments received in connection with equipment not
returned, totaled approximately $30.2 million, $37.8 million and $15.7 million
during the year ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
decrease from 2002 to 2003 resulted from a greater percentage of returned
leased equipment being redeployed to new lease customers and relatively less of
that equipment being offered for sale as remanufactured equipment. As
a result of recent changes in our equipment lease promotion, in 2004
we anticipate an increase in the number of subscribers who lease
rather than purchase equipment. The resulting anticipated increase in
capitalized costs is expected to more than offset the corresponding
reduction in expensed subscriber acquisition costs, and result in an
overall increase in cash used to acquire subscribers during 2004.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

We offer various programs to existing subscribers including programs for new
and upgraded equipment. We generally subsidize installation and all or a
portion of the cost of EchoStar receivers pursuant to our subscriber retention
programs. Costs related to subscriber retention programs are expected to
materially increase in 2004 as we introduce more aggressive subscriber
retention programs to reduce subscriber churn, to respond to competition and
for other reasons.

Funds necessary to meet subscriber acquisition and retention costs are expected
to be satisfied from existing cash and investment balances to the extent
available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to
meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of
debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However,
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on
acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

Intellectual property

.

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now
have and may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property
rights that cover or affect products or services directly or indirectly related
to those that we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of
our products infringes on intellectual property held by others, we would be
required to cease developing or marketing those products, to obtain licenses to
develop and market those products from the holders of the intellectual
property, or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing
the patent claims. Material damage awards, including the potential for triple
damages under patent laws, could also result. Various parties have asserted
patent and other intellectual property rights with respect to components within
our direct broadcast satellite system. Certain of these parties have filed
suit against us, as previously described. We cannot be certain that these
persons do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on
these rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on
commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses,
that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Semi-annual debt service requirements related to our 3% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2010 commenced on December 31, 2003. Semi-annual debt
service requirements related to our 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2008 and our 6 3/8%
Senior Notes due 2011 will commence on April 1, 2004. Quarterly debt service
requirements related to our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2008 commenced on
January 1, 2004. There are no scheduled principal payment or sinking fund
requirements prior to maturity on any of these notes.

Satellite-Related Obligations

During July 2003, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar
X, a Lockheed Martin A2100 class DBS satellite. Construction is expected to be
completed during 2005. EchoStar X will enable better bandwidth utilization,
provide back-up protection for our existing local channel offerings, allow us
to offer local channels by satellite in additional markets; and could allow
DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

As previously discussed in Item 1. — Business, during March 2003 we entered
into a satellite service agreement with SES Americom for all of the capacity on
a new FSS satellite, which may be located at the 105 degree orbital location or
certain other orbital locations. We also agreed to lease all of the capacity
on an existing in-orbit FSS satellite at the 105 degree orbital location
beginning August 1, 2003 and continuing at least until the new satellite is
launched. In connection with this agreement, we prepaid $50.0 million to SES
Americom to partially fund construction of the new satellite. The ten-year
satellite service agreement for the new satellite is renewable by us on a year
to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights
to replacement satellites. We are required to make monthly payments to SES
Americom for both the existing in-orbit FSS satellite and also for the new
satellite for the ten-year period following its launch. During August 2003, we
exercised our option under the SES Americom agreement to also lease for an
initial ten-year term all of the capacity on a new DBS satellite at an orbital
location to be determined at a future date. We anticipate that this satellite
will be launched during the fourth quarter of 2005.

During February 2004, we entered into two additional satellite service
agreements for capacity on FSS satellites. Pending the successful launch and
entry into service of the previously described new FSS satellite, the satellite
under the first of these agreements is scheduled for launch during the first
half of 2005. This agreement is a ten-year satellite service agreement that is
renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and
provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. We are required to
make monthly payments for this satellite for the ten-year period following its
launch. The satellite under the second of these agreements is planned for
launch during the second half of 2006 and is contingent upon, among other
things, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance
that we will obtain these approvals or that the satellite will ultimately be
launched. It is our intent to use the capacity on this satellite to offer
additional value-added services. Future commitments related to this contingent
satellite are included in the table above.

As a result of our recent agreements with fixed satellite service providers and
for the construction of EchoStar X, our obligations for payments related to
satellites have increased substantially. In certain circumstances the dates on
which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts
will increase when we commence payments for the launch of EchoStar X, and would
further
increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for
the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2004 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for
EchoStar satellite receiver systems and related equipment.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to
purchase programming content and will continue to do so. These programming
commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts
typically range from one to ten years and our payment obligations are fully
contingent on the number of subscribers to which we provide the respective
content. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to
the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses
are included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Satellite Insurance.

As of December 31, 2003, the indentures related to
certain of EDBS’ outstanding senior notes contain restrictive covenants that
required us to maintain satellite insurance with respect to at least half of
the satellites we own or lease. All of our nine in-orbit satellites are
currently owned by direct subsidiaries of EDBS. We currently do not carry
launch and/or in-orbit insurance for any of our nine in-orbit satellites. To
satisfy insurance covenants related to EDBS’ senior notes, we have reclassified
an amount equal to the depreciated cost of five of our satellites from cash and
cash equivalents to cash reserved for satellite insurance on our balance sheet.
As of December 31, 2003, cash reserved for satellite insurance totaled
approximately $176.8 million. Effective February 2, 2004, as a result of the
redemption of the EDBS 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009, our obligation to reserve
for satellite insurance declined to the depreciated cost of three of our
satellites. As an indirect result of this redemption, during February 2004, we
were able to reduce our reserve and reclassify approximately $57.2 million,
representing the depreciated cost of two of our satellites, from cash reserved
for satellite insurance to cash and cash equivalents. We will continue to
reserve cash for satellite insurance on our balance sheet until such time, if
ever, as we can again insure our satellites on acceptable terms and for
acceptable amounts, or until the covenants requiring the insurance are no
longer applicable. We believe we have in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient
to expeditiously recover transmission of most programming in the event one of
our in-orbit satellites fails. However, the cash reserved for satellite
insurance is not adequate to fund the construction, launch and insurance for a
replacement satellite in the event of a complete loss of a satellite.
Programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite
losses.

Future capital requirements.

In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring
business plans for FSS Ku-band and Ka-band satellite systems,
including licenses to operate at
the 97 and 123 degree orbital locations.

As a result of recent changes in our equipment lease and subscriber retention
promotions, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment
during 2004. In addition, in order to support the anticipated increase in the
number of local markets in which we offer local network channels by satellite
and for future broadband services, during 2004 we plan to construct four
mini-digital broadcast operations centers. As previously discussed, we expect
our capital expenditures for 2004 to be higher than 2003 capital expenditures
of $321.8 million.

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or
acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance
our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. As a
result, acquisition discussions and offers, and in some cases, negotiations may
take place and future material investments or acquisitions involving cash, debt
or equity securities or a combination thereof may result.

Security Ratings

Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB- on our long-term senior notes, and
B2 and B with respect to our convertible subordinated notes, as rated by
Moody’s Investor Service and Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, respectively.
Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency’s opinion of
the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due.

With respect to Moody’s, the Ba3 rating for senior debt indicates that the
obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to
substantial credit risk. For S&P, the BB- rating indicates the issuer is less
vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other
speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could
lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on
the obligation.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

With respect to Moody’s, the B2 rating for the convertible subordinated debt
indicates that the security is considered speculative and is subject to high
credit risk. For S&P, the B rating indicates the issuer is more vulnerable to
nonpayment of interest and principal obligations, but the issuer currently has
the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In general,
lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs. A security rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision
or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future
periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent
what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high
degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant
accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Continued

could be further compromised in the future. In order to combat piracy
and maintain the functionality of active set-top boxes that have been
sold to subscribers, we intend to replace older generation smart cards
with newer generation smart cards in the future. We have accrued a
liability for the replacement of smart cards based on the estimated
number of cards that will be needed to execute our plan. This estimate
was established based on a number of variables, including historical
subscriber churn trends and the estimated per card costs for smart card
replacements. Different assumptions or changes in, among other things,
the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases
in the smart card replacement reserve.

•

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

.

Management estimates the amount
of required allowances for the potential non-collectibility of accounts
receivable based upon past experience of collection and consideration
of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be
indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could
be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and
actual collections.

•

Income taxes

.

Our income tax policy is to record the estimated
future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance
sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required. Determining
necessary allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing
of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable
income and available tax planning opportunities. Future performance
could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or
reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of
operations.

•

Contingent liabilities

.

A significant amount of management
judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be
recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates
are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an
analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining
the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial
statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further
development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be
recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated
results of operations and financial position.

Seasonality

Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription
television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces
fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results
in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion
expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues in the
short-term until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in
future periods.

Inflation

Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three
years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our
products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive
pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments

As of December 31, 2003, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents
and marketable investment securities had a fair market value of approximately
$4.170 billion. Of that amount, a total of approximately $3.920 billion was
invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its
agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of
less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at
least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d)
instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described
above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve
principal



until the cash is required to fund operations. Consequently, the size of this
portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our
business.

Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable
investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December
31, 2003 of approximately 2.0%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest
rates would result in a decrease of approximately $6.5 million in annual
interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can
be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities
and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance
of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold.
However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent
rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also
be impacted by interest rate fluctuations.

At December 31, 2003, all of the $3.920 billion was invested in fixed or
variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in
interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair market value of fixed
and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity.
Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks
typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A
decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual
interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re-invested at lower
rates as the instruments mature. Over time, any net percentage decrease in
interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in
our interest income.

Included in our marketable securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of
public and private companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As
of December 31, 2003, we held strategic and financial debt and equity
investments of public companies with a fair market value of approximately
$249.4 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in
other debt and equity securities in the future. The fair market value of our
strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly
impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as
well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we
have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors.
These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value
due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying
businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public
strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $24.9
million decrease in the fair market value of that portfolio. The fair market
value of our strategic debt investments can also be impacted by interest rate
fluctuations. Absent the effect of other factors, a hypothetical 10.0%
increase in LIBOR would result in a decrease in the fair market value of our
investments in these debt instruments of approximately $2.7 million.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we adjust the
carrying value of our available-for-sale marketable investment securities to
fair market value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses
as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit, net of related deferred
income tax. Declines in the fair market value of a marketable investment
security which are estimated to be “other than temporary” are recognized in the
statement of operations, thus establishing a new cost basis for such
investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a
quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the market value of these
securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of
reviewing, among other things, the fair market value of our marketable
investment securities compared to the carrying value of these securities, the
historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company
specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors
to the contrary, declines in the fair market value of investments below cost
basis for a period of less than six months are considered to be temporary.
Declines in the fair market value of investments for a period of six to nine
months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company
or market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are
other than temporary. Declines in the fair market value of investments below
cost basis for greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and
are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2003, we have unrealized gains of approximately $79.6
million as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’
deficit. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we also recorded an
aggregate charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair
market value of certain of our marketable investment securities of
approximately $2.0 million, and established a new cost basis for these
securities. In addition, we realized net gains of approximately $21.9 million
on the sales of marketable investment securities. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, our portfolio generally, and our strategic investments
particularly, experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair
market value of our marketable securities portfolio does



not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company
specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our
securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in
future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair market value.

We also have made strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable
investment securities. These securities are not publicly traded. Our ability
to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not
public is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to
obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Since private
markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that
we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell
them that we will not be able to obtain full value for them. We evaluate our
non-marketable investment securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether
the carrying value of each investment is impaired. This quarterly evaluation
consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current
financial statements, if available, for factors which may indicate an
impairment in our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited
to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and
changes in business strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we did
not record any impairment charges with respect to these instruments.

As of December 31, 2003, we estimated the fair market value of our fixed-rate
debt and mortgages and other notes payable to be approximately $7.258 billion
using quoted market prices where available, or discounted cash flow analyses.
The interest rates assumed in such discounted cash flow analyses reflect
interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to
borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair market value of our fixed-rate
debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A
hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair
market value of our debt by approximately $186.4 million. To the extent
interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as
we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2003, a hypothetical
10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest
expense by approximately $49.9 million.

We have not used derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative
purposes.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss), stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. The 2001 consolidated financial statements of
EchoStar Communications Corporation and subsidiaries were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements in their report dated
February 27, 2002. That report included an explanatory note that stated that
they did not audit the financial statements of StarBand Communications, Inc.,
an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which was
reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2001.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EchoStar
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The below report is a copy of a previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP report
and this report has not been reissued.

To EchoStar Communications Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EchoStar
Communications Corporation (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of StarBand
Communications Inc., the investment in which is reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2001 using the equity method of accounting. The investment in StarBand
Communications Inc. represents approximately 0.6% of total assets as of
December 31, 2001, and the equity in its net losses represents approximately
16.7% of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001. The financial
statements of StarBand Communications Inc. were audited by other auditors whose
report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for StarBand Communications Inc., is based solely on the
report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of EchoStar Communications
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Business Activities

Principal Business

The operations of EchoStar Communications Corporation (“ECC,” and together with
its subsidiaries, “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) include
two interrelated business units:

•

The DISH Networ

k – which provides a direct broadcast satellite
subscription television service we refer to as “DBS” in the United
States; and

•

EchoStar Technologies Corporation

(“ETC”) – which designs and
develops DBS set-top boxes, antennae and other digital equipment for the
DISH Network. We refer to this equipment collectively as “EchoStar
receiver systems.” ETC also designs, develops and distributes similar
equipment for international satellite service providers.

Since 1994, we have deployed substantial resources to develop the “EchoStar DBS
System.” The EchoStar DBS System consists of our FCC-allocated DBS spectrum,
nine in-orbit satellites (“EchoStar I” through “EchoStar IX”), EchoStar
receiver systems, digital broadcast operations centers, customer service
facilities, and other assets utilized in our operations. Our principal
business strategy is to continue developing our subscription television service
in the United States to provide consumers with a fully competitive alternative
to cable television service.

Significant Risks and Uncertainties

Substantial Leverage

.

We are highly leveraged, which makes us vulnerable to
changes in general economic conditions. As of December 31, 2003, we had
outstanding long-term debt (including both the current and long-term portions)
totaling approximately $6.938 billion. We have quarterly and semi-annual cash,
debt service obligations for all of our outstanding long-term debt securities,

service obligations will depend on, among other factors, the successful
execution of our business strategy, which is subject to uncertainties and
contingencies beyond our control.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in
which we have control. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using
the equity method when we are able to significantly influence the operating
policies of the investee. When we do not significantly influence the operating
policies of an investee, the cost method is used. We eliminate all
intercompany balances and transactions. For entities that are considered
variable interest entities we apply the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.
(FIN) 46-R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
ARB No. 51.” All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
for each reporting period. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other
things, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory allowances, self
insurance obligations, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, loss
contingencies, fair values of financial instruments, asset impairments, useful
lives of property and equipment, royalty obligations and smart card
replacement obligations. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of
revisions are reflected in the period they occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar because their sales and purchases are predominantly denominated in that
currency. However, for our subsidiaries where the functional currency is the
local currency, we translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the
period end exchange rate and record the translation adjustments as a component
of other comprehensive income (loss). We translate revenues and expenses based
on the exchange rates at the time such transactions arise, if known, or at the
average rate for the period. Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate at the time of the
transaction and are included in other miscellaneous income and expense. Net
transaction gains (losses) during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were not significant.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90
days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003
and 2002 consist of money market funds, corporate notes and commercial paper.
The cost of these investments approximates their fair market value.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Investment Securities and Restricted Cash

We currently classify all marketable investment securities as
available-for-sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available-for-sale
securities to fair market value and report the related temporary unrealized
gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit, net of
related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair market value of a
marketable investment security which are estimated to be “other than temporary”
are recognized in the statement of operations, thus establishing a new cost
basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities
portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair market
value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation
consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair market value of our
marketable

F-10


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the
historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company
specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors
to the contrary, declines in the fair market value of investments below cost
basis for a period of less than six months are considered to be temporary.
Declines in the fair market value of investments for a period of six to nine
months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company
or market-specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are
other than temporary. Declines in the fair market value of investments below
cost basis for greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and
are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded unrealized gains of approximately
$79.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, as part of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ deficit. During the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we also recorded aggregate charges to
earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of certain
of our marketable investment securities of approximately $2.0 million, $117.1
million and $69.9 million, respectively, and established a new cost basis for
these securities. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, we realized net gains of approximately $21.9 million, $11.6 million and
$21.4 million on sales of marketable investment securities.

Our approximately $4.170 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash, cash
equivalents and marketable investment securities includes debt and equity
securities which we own for strategic and financial purposes. The fair market
value of these strategic marketable investment securities aggregated
approximately $249.4 million and $72.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Our portfolio generally, and our strategic investments
particularly, experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair
market value of our strategic marketable securities portfolio does not remain
above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific
factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our strategic
marketable securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to
earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair market
value.

We also have made strategic equity investments in certain non-marketable
investment securities. These securities are not publicly traded. Our ability to
realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly
traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to
obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Since private
markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that
we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell
them we will not be able to obtain full value for them. We account for such
unconsolidated investments under either the equity method or cost method of
accounting. Both methods are subject to other than temporary impairment on a
quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other
things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available,
for factors that may indicate an impairment in our investment. Such factors
may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation,
violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, we did not record any impairment charges with respect
to these investments.

Restricted cash, as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,
includes cash set aside as collateral for our line of credit and a facility
escrow.

of approximately $8.4 million, $23.9 million and $25.6 million during the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The costs of satellites
under construction are capitalized during the construction phase, assuming the
eventual successful launch and in-orbit operation of the satellite. If a
satellite were to fail during launch or while in-orbit, the resultant loss
would be charged to expense in the period such loss was incurred. The amount
of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received,
if any, as a result of the launch or in-orbit failure. Depreciation is
recorded on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from one to forty years.
Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense when incurred. Renewals
and betterments are capitalized.

Long-lived Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provision of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”). We review our long-lived assets
and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset would
be impaired if the book value of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its
undiscounted future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the
actual impairment is reported as the difference between the book value and the
fair market value as estimated using discounted cash flows. Assets which are
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
market value less costs to sell. We consider relevant cash flow, estimated
future operating results, trends and other available information in assessing
whether the carrying value of assets are recoverable.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The excess of investment in consolidated subsidiaries over net tangible and
intangible asset value at acquisition is recorded as goodwill. Our intangible
assets consist primarily of FCC licenses. On January 1, 2002, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives not be amortized but to be tested for impairment
annually or whenever indicators of impairments arise. Intangible assets that
have finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
The amortization and non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 were applied to all
goodwill and intangible assets acquired after September 30, 2001. As of
January 1, 2002, our FCC licenses have indefinite useful lives and are no
longer amortized because:

Had we not amortized our FCC licenses during the year ended December 31, 2001,
our net loss would have decreased by approximately $18.8 million, or $0.04 per
common share.

At January 1, 2002, we did not have any goodwill. In accordance with FAS 142,
we tested our indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting of FCC licenses)
and determined that there was no impairment required because the fair market
value of such assets exceeded the carrying value.

In accordance with the guidance of EITF Issue No. 02-7, “Unit of Accounting for
Testing Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset,” (“EITF 02-7”) we
combine all our indefinite life FCC licenses into a single unit of accounting.
The analysis encompasses future cash flows from satellites transmitting from
such licensed orbital locations, including revenue attributable to programming
offerings from such satellites, the direct operating and subscriber acquisition
costs related to such programming, and future capital costs for replacement
satellites. Projected revenue and cost amounts included current and projected
subscribers. In conducting our annual

F-13


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

impairment test in 2003, we determined
that the estimated fair market value of the FCC licenses, calculated using the
discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded their carrying amount.

In December 2003, we made an investment in South.com LLC (“South.com”), a
company we consolidate in our consolidated financial statements. South.com was
formed to, among other things, bid on and hold FCC licenses. During December
2003, South.com paid a $7.1 million deposit to participate in the January 2004
FCC license auction. This initial deposit is included in “Other current
assets” in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2003. South.com
participated in the January 2004 FCC license auction and was the high-bidder on
several licenses. Consequently, during January 2004 South.com paid an
additional deposit to the FCC of $20.6 million.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had approximately $52.7 million of gross
amortizable identifiable intangible assets with related accumulated
amortization of approximately $42.9 million and $32.6 million, respectively.
These identifiable intangibles primarily include acquired contracts and
technology-based intangibles. Amortization of these intangible assets with an
average finite useful life of approximately five years was $10.3 million and
$10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We
estimate that such amortization expense will aggregate approximately $9.8
million for the remaining useful life of these intangible assets of
approximately one year. In addition, we had approximately $3.4 million of
goodwill as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 which arose in connection with a 2002
acquisition.

Smart Card Replacement

We use conditional access technology, or smart cards, to encrypt the
programming we transmit to subscribers so that only those who pay for service
can receive our programming. Theft of cable and satellite programming has been
widely reported and our signal encryption has been pirated and could be further
compromised in the future. In order to combat piracy and maintain the
functionality of active set-top boxes that have been sold to subscribers, we
intend to replace older generation smart cards with newer generation smart
cards in the future. We have accrued a liability for the replacement of smart
cards in active set-top boxes that have been sold to subscribers. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had accrued $74.6 million and $80.8 million,
respectively, for replacement of these smart cards. During the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $6.2 million and $717 thousand,
respectively, was charged against the smart card accrual for the replacement of
older generation smart cards. This accrual is included in “Other accrued
expenses” in our consolidated balance sheets. Charges recorded to
“Subscriber-related expenses” in our consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss) totaled $2.9 million and $10.3 million,
respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. There was no
additional expense recorded for smart card replacements during 2003. This
liability will be reduced as smart card replacements occur. The liability for
the replacement of smart cards is based on the estimated number of cards that
will be needed to execute our plan. This estimate was established based on a
number of variables, including historical subscriber churn trends and the
estimated per card costs for smart card replacements. Different assumptions or
changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result
in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve.

Long-Term Deferred Distribution and Carriage Payments

Certain programmers provide us up-front payments. Such amounts are deferred
and in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor” (“EITF
02-16”) are recognized as reductions to “Subscriber-related expenses” on a
straight-line basis over the relevant remaining contract term (up to 10 years).
The current and long-term portions of these deferred credits are recorded in
the consolidated balance sheets in “Deferred revenue and other” and “Long-term
deferred distribution and carriage payments and other long-term liabilities,”
respectively.

F-14


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

Income Taxes

We establish a provision for income taxes currently payable or receivable and
for income tax amounts deferred to future periods in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS
109”). FAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets or liabilities be recorded
for the estimated future tax effects of differences that exist between the book
and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are offset by
valuation allowances in accordance with FAS 109, because we believe it is more
likely than not that such net deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments

Fair market values for our high-yield debt are based on quoted market prices.
The fair market values of our mortgages and other notes payable are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses

.

The interest rates assumed in such
discounted cash flow analyses reflect interest rates currently being offered
for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

over the terms of the respective notes (see Notes 5 and 15).

Revenue Recognition

Subscription and pay-per-view revenues are recognized when programming is
broadcast to subscribers. Subscriber fees for multiple set-top receivers and
equipment rental are recognized as revenue, monthly as earned. Advertising
revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. Payments
received from subscribers in advance of the broadcast are recorded as “Deferred
revenue” in the consolidated balance sheets until earned. Revenue from
international sales of digital set-top boxes and related accessories is
recognized upon shipment to customers.

Accounting for our new subscriber promotions which include programming
discounts falls under the scope of EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Capital Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). In accordance with EITF 01-9,
programming revenues under these promotions are recorded at the discounted
monthly rate charged to the subscriber. See Subscriber Acquisition Costs below
for discussion regarding the accounting for costs under these promotions.

Programming and Other Costs

The cost of television programming distribution rights is generally incurred on
a per subscriber basis and various upfront carriage payments are recognized
when the related programming is distributed to subscribers. The cost of
television programming rights to distribute live sporting events for a season
or tournament is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the
course of the season or tournament. Programming costs are included in
“Subscriber-related expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss).

Subscriber Acquisition Costs

Subscriber acquisition costs in our consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss) consist of costs incurred to acquire new
subscribers through third parties and our direct customer acquisition
distribution channel. Total subscriber acquisition costs include the following
line items from our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss):

•

“Cost of sales – subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes the cost
of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors
of our equipment and receiver systems sold directly by us to
subscribers.

•

“Other subscriber promotion subsidies”

includes net costs related
to various installation promotions and other promotional incentives.

•

“Subscriber acquisition advertising”

includes advertising and
marketing expenses related to the acquisition of new DISH Network
subscribers. Advertising costs generally are expensed as incurred.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, our significant new subscriber
promotions were as follows:

Free Dish –

Effective February 1, 2003, our Free DISH promotion provides new
subscribers with a choice of up to two EchoStar receivers, including one
premium model system, and free installation for $49.99. The subscriber receives
a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill. To be eligible, subscribers must
provide a valid major credit card, their social security number, pass a credit
score, and make a one-year commitment to subscribe to a qualified programming
package. Effective August 24, 2003, we expanded the above offer to include up
to three EchoStar receivers and require either a one or two year programming
commitment, depending on the set-top box models selected by the subscriber.
Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of the Free Dish
promotion, we expect it to continue through at least June 30, 2004.

Free for All

–

Effective February 1, 2003, our Free for All promotion provides
new subscribers who purchase up to two receivers for $149 or more, depending on
the models chosen, and subscribe to a qualifying programming package, free
installation, together with credits of $12.50 or $17.00 applied to their
programming bill each month for a year. Effective August 24, 2003, under our
Free for All promotion new subscribers who purchase one or two receiver systems
and subscribe to a qualifying programming package receive a monthly credit of
$10.00 for 15 or 20 months, respectively. Although there can be no assurance
as to the ultimate duration of the Free for All promotion, we expect it to
continue through at least June 30, 2004.

Digital Home Plan

–

Effective February 1, 2003, our Digital Home Plan promotion
offered new subscribers up to four EchoStar receivers, including various
models, with a minimum required programming package subscription. Each plan

The
subscriber receives a $49.99 credit on their first month’s bill. Effective
November 15, 2003, for an optional $99.00 upgrade fee or a two-year programming
commitment, we offered new subscribers an option to connect up to three
EchoStar receivers to up to four televisions. Since we retain ownership of
equipment installed pursuant to the Digital Home Plan promotion, equipment
costs are capitalized and depreciated over a period of approximately four
years. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate duration of our
current equipment lease promotion, we expect it to continue through at least
June 30, 2004.

Free Installation

–

Under our free installation program all subscribers who
purchase an EchoStar receiver system are eligible to receive free professional
installation of up to two receivers. Although there can be no assurance as to
the ultimate duration of the Free Installation promotion, we expect it to
continue through at least June 30, 2004.

Accounting for our dealer sales under our Free Dish and Free for All falls
under the scope of EITF 01-9. In accordance with that guidance, we
characterize as a reduction of revenue, amounts paid to our independent dealers
as consideration for equipment installation services and for equipment buydowns
(commissions and rebates). We expense payments for equipment installation
services as “Other subscriber promotion subsidies”. Our payments for equipment
buydowns represent a partial or complete return of the dealer’s purchase price
and are, therefore, netted against the proceeds received from the dealer. We
report the net cost from our various sales promotions through our independent
dealer network as a component of “Other subscriber promotion subsidies”. No
net proceeds from the sale of subscriber related equipment is recognized as
revenue. Accordingly, subscriber acquisition costs are generally expensed as
incurred except for under our equipment lease promotion wherein the Company
retains title to the receiver and certain other equipment resulting in the
capitalization and depreciation of such equipment cost over its estimated
useful life.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development costs totaled $32.4 million, $33.0 million and $19.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

We have elected to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” (“APB 25”) and related interpretations in accounting for our
stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 8.Under
APB 25, we generally do not recognize compensation expense on the grant of
options under our Stock Incentive Plan because typically the option terms are
fixed and the exercise price equals or exceeds the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant.We apply the disclosure only provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting and
Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation,” (“FAS 123”).

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by FAS 123 and has been determined as if we had accounted for our stock-based
compensation plans using the fair market value method prescribed by that
statement. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair market
value of the options is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period
on a straight-line basis. All options are initially assumed to vest.
Compensation previously recognized is reversed to the extent applicable to
forfeitures of unvested options. The following table illustrates the effect on
net income (loss) per share if we had accounted for our stock-based
compensation plans using the fair market value method:

The dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods since we have not and do
not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the near future. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair market value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable and so, our estimate of fair market value may differ from
other valuation models. Further, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair market value estimate, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair market
value of stock-based compensation awards.

Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (“FAS
128”) requires entities to present both basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and
diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised and convertible
securities were converted to common stock.

We recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the years ending
December 31, 2002 and 2001. Therefore, common stock equivalents and
convertible securities are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
(loss) per share for these periods since the effect of including them is
anti-dilutive. Since we reported net income attributable to common
shareholders for the year ending December 31, 2003, the potential dilution from
stock options exercisable into common stock for these periods was computed
using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the
class A common stock for the period. The following table reflects the basic
and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share amounts for all periods are
presented below in accordance with the requirements of FAS 128.

longer-term goals which have not yet been achieved. As such, the long-term
incentive options are not included in the diluted EPS calculation.

3. Financial Statement Restatement

During February 2004, we consulted with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) regarding our accrual for the replacement of smart cards. Those cards,
which provide security that only paying customers can receive programming
delivered by us, become obsolete as a result of piracy. During the consultation process, the
SEC informed us that it believes we over reserved approximately $30.2 million
for the replacement of certain smart cards. During prior years, ending in 2002,
we accrued the estimated cost to replace those cards, which are included in
satellite receivers that we sell and lease to consumers. The SEC did not object
to the accruals to replace the smart cards in satellite receivers sold to and
owned by consumers. However, the SEC believes that we over reserved
approximately $30.2 million, on a pre-tax basis, for the replacement of smart
cards in satellite receivers owned by us and leased to consumers.

On March 12, 2004, the SEC informed us it would not object if we restated our
financial statements for 2002 to record a reversal of the accruals for the
replacement of these smart cards of approximately $4.2 million, $17.2 million
and $8.8 million which were originally accrued in 2000, 2001 and from January 2002 through June
2002, respectively. As a result, we have restated our financial statements for
2002 as follows:

EchoStar I and II

EchoStar I and EchoStar II are both Series 7000 class satellites designed and
manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation. While both of those satellites
are currently functioning properly in orbit, a similar Lockheed Series 7000
class satellite owned by Loral Skynet recently experienced total in-orbit
failure. While we currently do not have sufficient information available to
reach any conclusions as to whether other satellites of the Series 7000 class
might be at increased risk of suffering a similar malfunction, no telemetry or
other data indicates EchoStar I or EchoStar II would be expected to experience
a similar failure. During December 2003, a spare Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier
(“TWTA”) was switched in to support operations on transponder 25 on EchoStar I
due to degraded operation of the primary TWTA. There are a total of 23
remaining TWTA’s available to support the 16 operational transponders on
EchoStar I. During 2003, one of the spare TWTA’s on EchoStar II which had been
found to be suspect during original In Orbit Test Operations in 1996 was
declared failed. There are a total of 23 remaining TWTA’s available to support
the 16 operational transponders on EchoStar II. EchoStar I and II are
currently located at the 148 west orbital location.

EchoStar III

During January 2004, a TWTA pair on EchoStar III failed, resulting in a loss of
service on one of our licensed transponders. Including the seven TWTA pairs
that malfunctioned in prior years, these anomalies have resulted in the failure
of a total of 16 TWTA’s on the satellite to date. While originally designed to
operate a maximum of 32 transponders at any given time, the satellite was
equipped with a total of 44 TWTA’s to provide redundancy. EchoStar III can now
operate a maximum of 28 transponders but due to redundancy switching
limitations and the specific channel

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

authorizations, currently it can only
operate on 17 of the 19 FCC authorized frequencies at the 61.5 degree west
orbital location. We are currently evaluating the performance of EchoStar III
and may be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in future
periods.

EchoStar V

During 2000, 2001 and 2002, EchoStar V experienced anomalies resulting in the
loss of three solar array strings, and during January 2003, EchoStar V
experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of an additional solar array
string. The satellite has a total of approximately 96 solar array strings and
approximately 92 are required to assure full power availability for the
estimated 12-year design life of the satellite. In addition, during January
2003, EchoStar V experienced an anomaly in a spacecraft electronic component
which affects the ability to receive telemetry from certain on-board equipment.
Other methods of communication have been established to alleviate the effects
of the failed component. An investigation of the solar array and electronic
component anomalies, none of which have impacted commercial operation of the
satellite, is continuing. In July 2001, EchoStar V experienced the loss of one
of its three momentum wheels. Two momentum wheels are utilized during normal
operations and a spare wheel was switched in at the time A second momentum
wheel experienced an anomaly in December 2003 and was switched out resulting in
operation of the spacecraft in a modified mode utilizing thrusters to maintain
spacecraft pointing. While this operating mode provides adequate performance,
it results in an increase in fuel usage and a corresponding reduction of
spacecraft life. This operating mode is not expected to reduce the estimated
design life of the satellite to less than 12 years. The investigation into the
anomaly is continuing. Until the root causes of these anomalies are finally
determined, there can be no assurance future anomalies will not cause further
losses which could impact commercial operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VIII

During 2002, two of the thrusters on EchoStar VIII experienced anomalous events
and are not currently in use. During March 2003, an additional thruster on
EchoStar VIII experienced an anomalous event and is not currently in use. The
satellite is equipped with a total of 12 thrusters that help control spacecraft
location, attitude, and pointing and is currently operating using a combination
of the other nine thrusters. This workaround requires more frequent maneuvers
to maintain the satellite at its specified orbital location, which are less
efficient and therefore result in accelerated fuel use. In addition, the
workaround has resulted in certain gyroscopes being utilized for aggregate
periods of time substantially in excess of their originally qualified limits.
However, neither of these workarounds are expected to reduce the estimated
design life of the satellite to less than 12 years. An investigation of the
thruster anomalies, including the development of additional workarounds for
long term operations, is continuing. None of these events has impacted
commercial operation of the satellite to date. Until the root cause of these
anomalies has been finally determined, there can be no assurance that these or
future anomalies will not cause further losses which could impact commercial
operation of the satellite.

EchoStar VIII is equipped with two solar arrays which convert solar energy into
power for the satellite. Those arrays rotate continuously to maintain optimal
exposure to the sun. During June and July 2003, EchoStar VIII experienced
anomalies that temporarily halted rotation of one of the solar arrays. In
December 2003 the other array experienced a similar anomaly. Both arrays are
currently fully functional, but rotating in a mode recommended by the satellite
manufacturer which allows full rotation but is different than the originally
prescribed mode. An investigation of the solar array anomalies, none of which
have impacted commercial operation of the satellite, is continuing. Until the
root cause of these anomalies is finally determined, there can be no assurance
future anomalies will not cause losses which could impact commercial operation
of the satellite.

During September 2003, a single battery cell on EchoStar VIII exhibited reduced
capacity. There are 72 battery cells on EchoStar VIII and all loads can be
maintained for the full design life of the satellite with up to two battery
cells fully failed. An investigation of the battery cell anomaly, which has
not impacted commercial operation of the satellite, is underway. Until the
root cause of the anomaly is determined, there can be no assurance future
anomalies will not cause losses which could impact commercial operation of the
satellite.

Satellite Insurance

As a result of the failure of EchoStar IV solar arrays to fully deploy and the
failure of 38 transponders to date, a maximum of 6 of the 44 transponders
(including spares) on EchoStar IV are available for use at this time. In
addition to transponder and solar array failures, EchoStar IV has experienced
anomalies affecting its thermal systems and propulsion system. EchoStar IV is
currently located at the 157 degree orbital location. There can be no
assurance that further material degradation, or total loss of use, of EchoStar
IV will not occur in the immediate future. As of December 31, 2003, EchoStar
IV is fully depreciated.

In September 1998, we filed a $219.3 million insurance claim for a total loss
under the launch insurance policies covering EchoStar IV. The satellite
insurance consists of separate substantially identical policies with different
carriers for varying amounts that, in combination, create a total insured
amount of $219.3 million. The insurance carriers include La Reunion Spatiale;
AXA Reinsurance Company (n/k/a AXA Corporate Solutions Reinsurance Company),
United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc., United States Aircraft Insurance
Group; Assurances Generales De France I.A.R.T. (AGF); Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s, London; Great Lakes Reinsurance (U.K.) PLC; British Aviation Insurance

Patrick; ZC Specialty Insurance; Lloyds of London Syndicates 588 NJM, 1209 Meb
AND 861 Meb; Generali France Assurances; Assurance France Aviation; and Ace
Bermuda Insurance Ltd.

The insurance carriers offered us a total of approximately $88.0 million, or
40% of the total policy amount, in settlement of the EchoStar IV insurance
claim. The insurers assert, among other things, that EchoStar IV was not a
total loss, as that term is defined in the policy, and that we did not abide by
the exact terms of the insurance policies. We strongly disagree and filed
arbitration claims against the insurers for breach of contract, failure to pay
a valid insurance claim and bad faith denial of a valid claim, among other
things. Due to individual forum selection clauses in certain of the policies,
we are pursuing our arbitration claims against Ace Bermuda Insurance Ltd. in
London, England, and our arbitration claims against all of the other insurance
carriers in New York, New York. The New York arbitration commenced on April
28, 2003, and the Arbitration Panel has now conducted approximately thirty-five
days of hearings. The parties to the London arbitration have agreed to stay
that proceeding pending a ruling in the New York arbitration.

At the time we filed our claim in 1998, we recognized an initial impairment
loss of $106.0 million to write-down the carrying value of the satellite and
related costs, and simultaneously recorded an insurance claim receivable for
the same amount. We will have to reduce the amount of this receivable if a
final settlement is reached for less than this amount. In addition, during
1999, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $16.0 million as a charge
to earnings to further write-down the carrying value of the satellite.

The $106.0 million insurance claim receivable has historically been classified
as a current asset. While there can be no assurance that we will receive the
amount claimed in either the New York or the London arbitrations, we continue
to believe the insurance claim amount is fully recoverable and expect to
receive a favorable decision prior to December 31, 2004. However, due to the
delays which have repeatedly occurred in the arbitration, as well as
uncertainty whether any decision might be appealed, we are not confident that
we will receive the cash proceeds related to this claim prior to December 31,
2004. Consequently, during 2003, we reclassified the insurance claim
receivable from current to long-term. The classification of this receivable
will continue to be evaluated each quarter until such time as payment is
received. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year presentation.

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

As a result of transponder, thermal and propulsion system anomalies only 6
transponders are currently available on EchoStar IV. We cannot predict with
certainty how much longer we will be able to transmit programming from EchoStar
IV.

The indentures related to certain of EDBS’ senior notes contain restrictive
covenants that require us to maintain satellite insurance with respect to at
least half of the satellites EDBS owns or leases. As of December 31, 2003,
nine of our in-orbit satellites were in service and owned by a direct
subsidiary of EDBS. As of December 31, 2003, insurance coverage was therefore
required for at least five of EDBS’ nine satellites. We currently do not carry
launch and/or in-orbit insurance for any of our nine in-orbit satellites. To
satisfy insurance covenants related to EDBS’ senior notes, we have reclassified
an amount equal to the depreciated cost of five of our satellites from “Cash
and cash equivalents” to “Cash reserved for satellite insurance” on our balance
sheet. As of December 31, 2003, “Cash reserved for satellite insurance”
totaled approximately $176.8 million. The reclassifications will continue
until such time, if ever, as we can again insure our satellites on acceptable
terms and for acceptable amounts or until the covenants requiring the insurance
are no longer applicable. Reserve requirements for satellite insurance
decreased approximately $57.2 million as of the February 2004 due to the
redemption of the 9 3/8% Senior Notes (See Note 15 – Subsequent Events).

9 1/4% Senior Notes due 2006 and 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009

Effective February 1, 2003, EDBS redeemed all of its outstanding 9 1/4% Senior
Notes due 2006. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the
notes, the $375.0 million principal amount of the notes was redeemed at
104.625%, for a total of approximately $392.3 million. As a result of the
redemption, the indentures related to the 9 1/4% Senior Notes were satisfied
and cease to exist. The premium paid of
approximately $17.3 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of
approximately $3.3 million were recorded as charges to earnings and are
included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss).

During the fourth quarter of 2003, EDBS repurchased in open market transactions
approximately $201.6 million of the original $1.625 billion principal amount of
its 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009. The difference between the market price paid
and the principal amount of approximately $12.7 million and unamortized debt
issuance costs related to the repurchased notes of approximately $1.6 million
were recorded as charges to earnings and are included in interest expense in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Effective February 2, 2004, the remaining balance of the 9 3/8% Senior Notes of
approximately $1.423 billion was redeemed in accordance with the terms of the
indenture governing the notes (see Note 15 – Subsequent Events). As a portion
of the 9 3/8% Senior Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2003, we
continued to be subject to the terms of the related indentures until the 9 3/8%
Senior Notes were redeemed, in full, on February 2, 2004.

Interest on the 9 3/8 % Senior Notes accrued at an annual rate of 9 3/8% and
was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each
year, commencing August 1, 1999.

With the exception of certain de minimis domestic and foreign subsidiaries, the
9 3/8% Senior Notes were fully, unconditionally and jointly and severally
guaranteed by all subsidiaries of EDBS. The 9 3/8% Senior Notes were general
senior unsecured obligations which:

•

ranked

pari passu

in right of payment to each other and to all existing and future senior unsecured obligations;

•

ranked senior to all existing and future junior obligations; and

•

were effectively junior to secured obligations to the extent of the collateral securing such obligations, including any borrowings under future secured credit facilities.

Except under certain circumstances requiring prepayment premiums, and in other
limited circumstances, the 9 3/8% Senior Notes were not redeemable at EDBS’
option prior to February 1, 2004. The 9 3/8% Senior Notes were subject

decreasing from 104.688% during the year commencing February 1, 2004 to 100% on
or after February 1, 2008, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to
the redemption date.

The indentures related to the 9 3/8% Senior Notes contained restrictive
covenants that, among other things, imposed limitations on the ability of EDBS
to:

In the event of a change of control, as defined in the 9 3/8% Senior Notes
indenture, EDBS was required to make an offer to repurchase all of the 9 3/8%
Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the date
of repurchase.

10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007

The 10 3/8% Senior Notes mature October 1, 2007. Interest accrues at an annual
rate of 10 3/8% and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and
October 1 of each year.

These notes were sold on September 25, 2000 by EchoStar Broadband Corporation
(“EBC”), a previously wholly-owned subsidiary which was dissolved in 2003.
Under the terms of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes Indenture, EBC agreed to cause its
subsidiary, EDBS to make an offer to exchange (the “EDBS Exchange Offer”) all
of the outstanding 10 3/8% Senior Notes for a new class of notes issued by EDBS
as soon as practical following the first date (as reflected in EDBS’ most
recent quarterly or annual financial statements) on which EDBS was permitted to
incur indebtedness in an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of
the 10 3/8% Senior Notes under the “Indebtedness to Cash Flow Ratio” test
contained in the indentures (the “EDBS Indentures”) governing the EDBS 9 1/4%
Senior Notes and 9 3/8% Senior Notes, and such incurrence of indebtedness would
not otherwise cause any breach or violation of, or result in a default under,
the terms of the EDBS Indentures.

Effective November 5, 2002, EDBS completed its offer to exchange all of the
$1.0 billion principal outstanding of EBC’s 10 3/8% Senior Notes for
substantially identical notes of EDBS. Tenders were received from holders of
over 99% of the EBC Notes. Per the terms of the indenture related to the EBC
Notes, if at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding EBC
Notes have accepted the exchange offer, then all of the then outstanding EBC
Notes shall be deemed to have been exchanged for the EDBS Notes.

Except under certain circumstances requiring prepayment premiums, and in other
limited circumstances, the 10 3/8% Senior Notes are not redeemable at our
option prior to October 1, 2004. Thereafter, the 10 3/8% Senior Notes will be
subject to redemption, at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices
decreasing from 105.188% during the year commencing October 1, 2004 to 100% on
or after October 1, 2006, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to
the redemption date.

The indenture related to the 10 3/8% Senior Notes (the “10 3/8% Senior Notes
Indenture”) contains certain restrictive covenants that generally do not impose
material limitations on us. Subject to certain limitations, the 10 3/8% Senior
Notes Indenture permits EDBS to incur additional indebtedness, including
secured and unsecured indebtedness that ranks on parity with the 10 3/8% Senior
Notes. Any secured indebtedness will, as to the collateral securing such
indebtedness, be effectively senior to the 10 3/8% Senior Notes to the extent
of such collateral.

6. Income Taxes

As of December 31, 2003, we had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”) for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $3.270 billion and credit
carryforwards of approximately $7.1 million. The NOL’s begin to expire in the
year 2011 and capital loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the
year 2006.

During 2003, we decreased our valuation allowance by approximately $83.0
million as a result of a decrease in net deferred tax assets. During 2002, we
increased our valuation allowance by approximately $277.9 million to fully
offset all net deferred tax assets. Included in this increase is $210.8
million relating to deferred tax assets generated during 2002 and $67.1 million
relating to the balance of the net deferred tax asset that was not offset by a
valuation allowance at December 31, 2001.

The federal NOL includes amounts related to tax deductions totaling
approximately $229.2 million for exercised stock options. The tax benefit of
these deductions has been allocated directly to contributed capital and has
been offset by a valuation allowance.

During 2003 and 2002, stock option compensation expenses related to the 1999
Incentive Plan, for which an estimated deferred tax benefit was previously
recorded, exceeded the actual tax deductions allowed. Tax charges associated
with the reversal of the prior tax benefit have been allocated to additional
paid-in capital in accordance with Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. During 2003 and 2002, charges of
$6.4 and $7.0 million, respectively, were made to additional paid-in capital.

7. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)

Common Stock

The class A, class B and class C common stock are equivalent in all respects
except voting rights. Holders of Class A and class C common stock are entitled
to one vote per share and holders of class B common stock are entitled to 10
votes per share. Each share of class B and class C common stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of class A common
stock. Upon a change in control of ECC, each holder of outstanding shares of
class C common stock is entitled to 10 votes for each share of class C common
stock held. Our principal stockholder owns all outstanding class B common
stock and all other stockholders own class A common stock. There are no shares
of class C common stock outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase

During the fourth quarter of 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of our class A common stock.
We may make repurchases of our class A common stock through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and
other factors. Our repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any
specific number or amount of securities and any of those programs may be
terminated at any time. We may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans from time to time
to facilitate repurchases of our securities. As of December 31, 2003,
treasury shares have been repurchased at a cost of approximately $190.4
million.

8. Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Incentive Plan

We have adopted stock incentive plans to provide incentive to attract and
retain officers, directors and key employees. We currently have 80.0 million
shares of our class A common stock reserved for granting awards under our 1995
Stock Incentive Plan and an additional 80.0 million shares of our class A
common stock for granting awards under our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. In
general, stock options granted through December 31, 2003 have included exercise
prices not less than the fair market value of our class A common stock at the
date of grant, and vest, as determined by our Board of Directors, generally at
the rate of 20% per year.

During 1999, we adopted an incentive plan under our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan,
which provided certain key employees a contingent incentive including stock
options and cash. The payment of these incentives was contingent upon the
achievement of certain financial and other goals of EchoStar. We met certain
of these goals during 1999. Accordingly, in 1999, we recorded approximately
$178.8 million of deferred compensation related to post-grant appreciation of
options to purchase approximately 4.2 million shares. The related deferred
compensation, net of forfeitures, is being recognized over the five-year
vesting period. During the year ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we
recognized expense of $3.5 million, $11.3 million and $20.2 million,
respectively, under the 1999 incentive plan. The remaining deferred
compensation of $1.2 million, which will be reduced by future forfeitures, if
any, will be recognized in 2004.

We report all non-cash compensation based on stock option appreciation as a
single expense category in our accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss). The following table represents the
other expense categories in our consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss) that would be affected if non-cash, stock-based
compensation was allocated to the same expense categories as the base
compensation for key employees who participate in the 1999 incentive plan.

Options to purchase an additional 8.0 million shares are outstanding as of
December 31, 2003 and were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of the underlying shares on the date they were issued during 1999,
2000 and 2001 pursuant to a long term incentive plan under our 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan. The weighted-average exercise price of these options is $9.05.
Vesting of these options is contingent upon
meeting certain longer-term goals which have not yet been achieved.
Consequently, no compensation was recorded during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 related to these long-term options. We will record the
related compensation at the achievement of the performance goals, if ever.
Such compensation, if recorded, would likely result in material non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income (loss).

9. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved an employee stock
purchase plan (the “ESPP”), effective beginning October 1, 1997. Under the
ESPP, we are authorized to issue a total of 800,000 shares of class A common
stock. Substantially all full-time employees who have been employed by us for
at least one calendar quarter are eligible to participate in the ESPP.
Employee stock purchases are made through payroll deductions. Under the terms
of the ESPP, employees may not deduct an amount which would permit such
employee to purchase our capital stock under all of our stock purchase plans at
a rate which would exceed $25,000 in fair market value of capital stock in any
one year. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the closing price of the
class A common stock on the last business day of each calendar quarter in which
such shares of class A common stock are deemed sold to an employee under the
ESPP. The ESPP shall terminate upon the first to occur of (i) October 1, 2007
or (ii) the date on which the ESPP is terminated by the Board of Directors.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001 employees purchased approximately 66,000, 108,000
and 80,000 shares of class A common stock through the ESPP, respectively.

401(k) Employee Savings Plan

We sponsor a 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for eligible
employees. Voluntary employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be matched
50% by us, subject to a maximum annual contribution by us of $1,000 per
employee. Forfeitures of unvested participant balances which are retained by
the 401(k) Plan may be used to fund matching and discretionary contributions.
Expense recognized related to matching 401(k) contributions, net of
forfeitures, totaled approximately $632 thousand, $993 thousand and $429
thousand during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
We also may make an annual discretionary contribution to the plan with
approval by our Board of Directors, subject to the maximum deductible limit
provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These contributions
may be made in cash or in our stock. Discretionary contributions, net of
forfeitures, were approximately $15.4 million, $16.9 million and $225 thousand
relating to the 401(k) Plan years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Satellite-Related Obligations

During July 2003, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar
X, a Lockheed Martin A2100 class DBS satellite. Construction is expected to be
completed during 2005. EchoStar X will enable better bandwidth utilization,
provide back-up protection for our existing local channel offerings, allow us
to offer local channels by satellite in additional markets; and could allow
DISH Network to offer other value-added services.

During March 2003 we entered into a satellite service agreement with SES
Americom for all of the capacity on a new FSS satellite, which may be located
at the 105 degree orbital location or certain other orbital locations. We also
agreed to lease all of the capacity on an existing in-orbit FSS satellite at
the 105 degree orbital location beginning August 1, 2003 and continuing at
least until the new satellite is launched. In connection with this agreement,
we prepaid $50.0 million to SES Americom to partially fund construction of the
new satellite. The ten-year satellite service agreement for the new satellite
is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and
provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. We are required to
make monthly payments to SES Americom for both the existing in-orbit FSS
satellite and also for the new satellite for the ten-year period following its
launch. During August 2003, we exercised our option under the SES Americom
agreement to also lease for an initial ten-year term all of the capacity on a
new DBS satellite at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. We
anticipate that this satellite will be launched during the fourth quarter of
2005.

During February 2004, we entered into two additional satellite service
agreements for capacity on FSS satellites. Pending the successful launch and
entry into service of the previously described new FSS satellite, the satellite
under the first of these agreements is scheduled for launch during the first
half of 2005. This agreement is a ten-year satellite service agreement that is
renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and
provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. We are required to
make monthly payments for this satellite for the ten-year period following its
launch. The satellite under the second of these agreements is planned for
launch during the second half of 2006 and is contingent upon, among other
things, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance
that we will obtain these approvals or that the satellite will ultimately be
launched. It is our intent to use the capacity on this satellite to offer
additional value-added services. Future commitments related to this contingent
satellite are included in the table above.

As a result of our recent agreements with fixed satellite service providers and
for the construction of EchoStar X, our obligations for payments related to
satellites have increased substantially. In certain circumstances the dates on
which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts
will increase when we commence payments for the launch of EchoStar X, and would
further increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or
contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.

Purchase Obligations

Our 2004 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for
EchoStar satellite receiver systems and related equipment.

Programming Contracts

In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to
purchase programming content and will continue to do so. These commitments are
not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range
from one to ten years and our payment obligations are fully contingent on the
number of subscribers to which we provide the respective content.
Consequently, our programming expenses will to continue to increase to the
extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are
included in “Subscriber-related expenses” in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Rent Expense

Total rent expense for operating leases approximated $32.2 million, $17.9
million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Many entities, including some of our competitors, now have and may in the
future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or
affect products or services directly or indirectly related to those that we
offer. We may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property
rights that our products may potentially infringe. Damages in patent
infringement cases can include a tripling of actual damages in certain cases.
Further, we cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the
future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others and the
availability and cost of any such licenses. Various parties have asserted
patent and other intellectual property rights with respect to components within
our direct broadcast satellite system. We cannot be certain that these persons
do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on these
rights, that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on
commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses,
that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.

Contingencies

WIC Premium Television Ltd.

During July 1998, WIC Premium Television Ltd. (“WIC”), an Alberta corporation,
filed a lawsuit against us in the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division.
General Instrument Corporation, HBO, Warner Communications, Inc., Showtime and
United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. were also named as
defendants.

During September 1998, WIC filed another lawsuit against us in the Court of
Queen’s Bench of Alberta Judicial District of Edmonton. WIC is authorized to
broadcast certain copyrighted work, such as movies and concerts, to residents
of Canada. WIC alleged that the defendants engaged in, promoted, and/or
allowed satellite dish equipment from the United States to be sold in Canada
and to Canadian residents and that some of the defendants allowed and profited
from Canadian residents purchasing and viewing subscription television
programming that is only authorized for viewing in the United States. During
December 2003, the matter was dismissed with no impact on our business.

Distant Network Litigation

Until July 1998, we obtained feeds of distant broadcast network channels
(ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX) for distribution to our customers through PrimeTime 24.
In December 1998, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida entered a nationwide permanent injunction requiring PrimeTime 24 to
shut off distant network channels to many of its customers, and henceforth to
sell those channels to consumers in accordance with the injunction.

In October 1998, we filed a declaratory judgment action against ABC, NBC,
CBS and FOX in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
We asked the Court to find that our method of providing distant network
programming did not violate the Satellite Home Viewer Act and hence did not
infringe the networks’ copyrights. In November 1998, the networks and their
affiliate association groups filed a complaint against us in Miami Federal
Court alleging, among other things, copyright infringement. The Court combined
the case that we filed in Colorado with the case in Miami and transferred it to
the Miami Federal Court.

In February 1999, the networks filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining
Order, Preliminary Injunction and Contempt Finding against DirecTV, Inc. in
Miami related to the delivery of distant network channels to DirecTV customers
by satellite. DirecTV settled that lawsuit with the networks. Under the terms
of the settlement between DirecTV and the networks, some DirecTV customers were
scheduled to lose access to their satellite-provided distant network channels
by July 31, 1999, while other DirecTV customers were to be disconnected by
December 31, 1999. Subsequently, substantially all providers of
satellite-delivered network programming other than us agreed to this cut-off
schedule, although we do not know if they adhered to this schedule.

In April 2002, we reached a private settlement with ABC, Inc., one of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. In
November 2002, we reached a private settlement with NBC, another of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. On
March 10, 2004, we reached a private settlement with CBS, another of the
plaintiffs in the litigation and jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal. We
have also reached private settlements with many independent stations and
station groups. We were unable to reach a settlement with five of the original
eight plaintiffs –Fox and the associations affiliated with each of the four
networks.

A trial took place during April 2003 and the Court issued its final judgment in
June 2003. The District Court found that with one exception our current
distant network qualification procedures comply with the law. We have revised
our procedures to comply with the District Court’s Order. Although the
plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter an injunction precluding us from
selling any local or distant network programming, the District Court refused.
While the networks did not claim monetary damages and none were awarded, they
are seeking approximately $10.0 million of attorney fees.

F-38


ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

The District Court’s injunction requires us to use a computer model to
re-qualify, as of June 2003, all of our subscribers who receive ABC, NBC, CBS
or Fox programming by satellite from a market other than the city in which the
subscriber lives. The Court also invalidated all waivers historically provided
by network stations. These waivers, which have been provided by stations for
the past several years through a third party automated system, allow
subscribers who believe the computer model improperly disqualified them for
distant network channels to none-the-less receive those channels by satellite.
Further, even though the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act provides that
certain subscribers who received distant network channels prior to October 1999
can continue to receive those channels through December 2004, the District
Court terminated the right of our grandfathered subscribers to continue to
receive distant network channels.

We believe the District Court made a number of errors and appealed the District
Court’s decision. Plaintiffs cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals granted our
request to stay the injunction until our appeal is decided. Oral argument
occurred on February 26, 2004. It is not possible to predict how or when the
Court of Appeals will rule on the merits of our appeal.

In the event the Court of Appeals upholds the injunction, and if we do not
reach private settlement agreements with additional stations, we will attempt
to assist subscribers in arranging alternative means to receive network
channels, including migration to local channels by satellite where available,
and free off air antenna offers in other markets. However, we cannot predict
with any degree of certainty how many subscribers will cancel their primary
DISH Network programming as a result of termination of their distant network
channels. We could be required to terminate distant network programming to all
subscribers in the event the plaintiffs prevail on their cross-appeal and we
are permanently enjoined from delivering all distant network channels.
Termination of distant network programming to subscribers would result, among
other things, in a reduction in average monthly revenue per subscriber and a
temporary increase in churn.

Gemstar

During October 2000, Starsight Telecast, Inc., a subsidiary of Gemstar-TV Guide
International, Inc. (“Gemstar”), filed a suit for patent infringement against
us and certain of our subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the
Western District of North Carolina, Asheville Division. The suit alleges
infringement of United States Patent No. 4,706,121 (“the ‘121 Patent”) which
relates to certain electronic program guide functions.

In December 2000, we filed suit against Gemstar-TV Guide (and certain of its
subsidiaries) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
alleging violations by Gemstar of various federal and state anti-trust laws and
laws governing unfair competition. Gemstar filed counterclaims alleging
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,923,362 and 5,684,525 that relate
to certain electronic program guide functions. In addition, Gemstar asserted
new patent infringement counterclaims regarding United States Patent Nos.
4,908,713 and 5,915,068. These patents relate to on-screen programming of
VCRs.

In February 2001, Gemstar filed patent infringement actions against us in the
District Court in Atlanta, Georgia and with the ITC. These suits allege
infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,252,066, 5,479,268 and 5,809,204,
all of which relate to certain electronic program guide functions. In
addition, the ITC action alleged infringement of the ‘121 Patent which was also
asserted in the North Carolina case previously discussed. On March 1, 2004, we
entered into a number of agreements with Gemstar including a settlement
agreement which provides for the resolution of the aforementioned disputes
between us and Gemstar. The effectiveness of the settlement is subject to
certain conditions, including the closing of the SNG sale (see Note 15 –
Subsequent Events).

During 2000, Superguide Corp. (“Superguide”) also filed suit against us,
DirecTV and others in the United States District Court for the Western District
of North Carolina, Asheville Division, alleging infringement of United States
Patent Nos. 5,038,211, 5,293,357 and 4,751,578 which relate to certain
electronic program guide functions, including the use of electronic program
guides to control VCRs. Superguide sought injunctive and declaratory relief
and damages in an unspecified amount. It is our understanding that these
patents may be licensed by Superguide to Gemstar.

Gemstar was added as a party
to this case and asserted these patents against us. We examined these patents
and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or services. A
Markman ruling interpreting the patent claims was issued by the Court and in
response to that ruling, we filed motions for summary judgment of
non-infringement for each of the asserted patents. Gemstar filed a motion for
summary judgment of infringement with respect to one of the patents. During
July 2002, the Court issued a
Memorandum of Opinion on the summary judgment motions. In its Opinion, the
Court ruled that none of our products infringe the 5,038,211 and 5,293,357
patents. With respect to the 4,751,578 patent, the Court ruled that none of
our current products infringed that patent and asked for additional information
before it could rule on certain low-volume products that are no longer in
production. During July 2002, the Court summarily ruled that the
aforementioned low-volume products did not infringe any of the asserted
patents. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case and awarded us our court
costs and the case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit. On February 12, 2004, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part
and reversed in part the District Court’s findings and remanded the case back
to the District Court for further proceedings. We will continue to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we
infringe on any of the aforementioned patents, we may be subject to substantial
damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that could
require us to materially modify certain user-friendly electronic programming
guide and related features that we currently offer to consumers. It is not
possible to make a firm assessment of the probable outcome of the suit or to
determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Broadcast Innovation, LLC

In November of 2001, Broadcast Innovation, LLC filed a lawsuit against
EchoStar, DirecTV, Thomson Consumer Electronics and others in Federal District
Court in Denver, Colorado. The suit alleges infringement of United States
Patent Nos. 6,076,094 (“the ‘094 patent”) and 4,992,066 (“the ‘066 patent”).
The ‘094 patent relates to certain methods and devices for transmitting and
receiving data along with specific formatting information for the data. The
‘066 patent relates to certain methods and devices for providing the scrambling
circuitry for a pay television system on removable cards. We examined these
patents and believe that they are not infringed by any of our products or
services. Subsequently, DirecTV and Thomson settled with Broadcast Innovation
leaving EchoStar as the only defendant. On January 23, 2004, the judge issued
an order finding the ‘066 patent invalid as being indefinite in violation of 35
U.S.C. Sec. 112. Motions with respect to the infringement, invalidity and
construction of the ‘094 patent remain pending. We will continue to vigorously
defend this case. In the event that a Court ultimately determines that we
infringe on any of the aforementioned patents, we may be subject to substantial
damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that could
require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of
the probable outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential
liability or damages.

TiVo Inc.

In January of 2004, TiVo Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. We have not yet filed our
answer. The suit alleges infringement of United States Patent No. 6,233,389
(“the ‘389 patent”). The ‘389 patent relates to certain methods and devices
for providing what the patent calls “time-warping”. We have examined this
patent and do not believe that it is infringed by any of our products or
services. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a Court
ultimately determines that we infringe this patent, we may be subject to
substantial damages, which may include treble damages and/or an injunction that
could require us to materially modify certain user-friendly features that we
currently offer to consumers. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of
the probable outcome of the suit or to determine the extent of any potential
liability or damages.

California Actions

A purported class action was filed against us in the California State Superior
Court for Alameda County during 2001 by Andrew A. Werby. The complaint related
to late fees, among other things. The matter was settled with no material
impact on our business.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

A purported class action relating to the use of terms such as “crystal clear
digital video,” “CD-quality audio,” and “on-screen program guide,” and with
respect to the number of channels available in various programming packages was
also filed against us in the California State Superior Court for Los Angeles
County in 1999 by David Pritikin and by Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit
unincorporated association. The complaint alleges breach of express warranty
and violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code
Sections 1750, et seq., and the California Business & Professions Code Sections
17500 &
17200. A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and our
motion for summary judgment was held during June 2002. At the hearing, the
Court issued a preliminary ruling denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification. However, before issuing a final ruling on class certification,
the Court granted our motion for summary judgment with respect to all of the
plaintiffs’ claims. Subsequently, we filed a motion for attorney’s fees which
was denied by the Court. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the
court’s granting of our motion for summary judgment and we cross-appealed the
Court’s ruling on our motion for attorney’s fees. On December 5, 2003, the
Court of Appeal affirmed in part; and reversed in part, the lower court’s
decision granting summary judgment in our favor. Specifically, the Court found
there were triable issues of fact as to whether we may have violated the
alleged consumer statutes “with representations concerning the number of
channels and the program schedule.” However, the Court found no triable issue
of fact as to whether the representations “crystal clear digital video” or “CD
quality” audio constituted a cause of action. Moreover, the Court affirmed
that the “reasonable consumer” standard was applicable to each of the alleged
consumer statutes. Plaintiff argued the standard should be the “least
sophisticated” consumer. The Court also affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’
breach of warranty claim. Plaintiff filed a Petition for Review with the
California Supreme Court and EchoStar responded. On March 24, 2004, the
California Supreme Court denied Plaintiff’s Petition for Review. Therefore,
the action has been remanded to the trial court pursuant to the instructions of
the Court of Appeal. It is too early in the litigation to make an assessment of
the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent of any
potential liability against us.

State Investigation

During April 2002, two state attorneys general commenced a civil investigation
concerning certain of our business practices. Over the course of the next six
months, 11 additional states ultimately joined the investigation. The states
alleged failure to comply with consumer protection laws based on our call
response times and policies, advertising and customer agreement disclosures,
policies for handling consumer complaints, issuing rebates and refunds and
charging cancellation fees to consumers, and other matters. We cooperated
fully in the investigation. During May 2003, we entered into an Assurance of
Voluntary Compliance with the states which ended their investigation. The
states have released all claims related to the matters investigated.

Retailer Class Actions

We have been sued by retailers in three separate purported class actions.
During October 2000, two separate lawsuits were filed in the Arapahoe County
District Court in the State of Colorado and the United States District Court
for the District of Colorado, respectively, by Air Communication & Satellite,
Inc. and John DeJong, et al. on behalf of themselves and a class of persons
similarly situated. The plaintiffs are attempting to certify nationwide
classes on behalf of certain of our satellite hardware retailers. The
plaintiffs are requesting the Courts to declare certain provisions of, and
changes to, alleged agreements between us and the retailers invalid and
unenforceable, and to award damages for lost incentives and payments, charge
backs, and other compensation. We are vigorously defending against the suits
and have asserted a variety of counterclaims. The United States District Court
for the District of Colorado stayed the Federal Court action to allow the
parties to pursue a comprehensive adjudication of their dispute in the Arapahoe
County State Court. John DeJong, d/b/a Nexwave, and Joseph Kelley, d/b/a
Keltronics, subsequently intervened in the Arapahoe County Court action as
plaintiffs and proposed class representatives. We have filed a motion for
summary judgment on all counts and against all plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have
filed a motion for additional time to conduct discovery to enable them to
respond to our motion. The Court has not ruled on either of the two motions.
It is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation
or to determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Satellite Dealers Supply, Inc. (“SDS”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas during September 2000,
on behalf of itself and a class of persons similarly situated. The plaintiff
was attempting to certify a nationwide class on behalf of sellers, installers,
and servicers of satellite equipment who contract with us and who allege that
we: (1) charged back certain fees paid by members of the class to professional
installers in violation of contractual terms; (2) manipulated the accounts of
subscribers to deny payments to class members; and (3) misrepresented, to class
members, the ownership of certain equipment related to the provision of our
satellite television service. During September 2001, the Court granted our
motion to dismiss. The plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the Court’s
order dismissing the case. The Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration. The trial court denied our motions for sanctions against SDS.
Both parties perfected appeals before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On
appeal, the Fifth Circuit upheld the dismissal for lack of personal
jurisdiction. The Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded the district court’s
denial of our motion for sanctions and instructed the district court to decide
the issue again and to issue a written opinion, which it had failed to do the
first time. It is not possible to make a firm assessment of the probable
outcome on that issue or to determine the extent of any recovery of sanctions.

StarBand Shareholder Lawsuit

On August 20, 2002, a limited group of shareholders in StarBand filed an action
in the Delaware Court of Chancery against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation,
together with four EchoStar executives who sat on the Board of Directors for
StarBand, for alleged breach of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith
and loyalty, and also against EchoStar and EchoBand Corporation for aiding and
abetting such alleged breaches. Two of the individual defendants, Charles W.
Ergen and David K. Moskowitz, are members of our Board of Directors. The
action stems from the defendants’ involvement as directors, and EchoBand’s
position as a shareholder, in StarBand, a broadband Internet satellite venture
in which we invested. On July 28, 2003, the Court granted the defendants’
motion to dismiss on all counts. The Plaintiffs have since filed a notice of
appeal. Oral argument on the appeal was held on January 6, 2004. EchoStar is
waiting for the decision on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. It is not
possible to make a firm assessment of the probable outcome of the appeal or to
determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Shareholder Derivative Action

During October 2002, a purported shareholder filed a derivative action against
members of our Board of Directors in the United States District Court of Clark
County, Nevada and naming us as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges
breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and other unlawful acts relating to
our agreement to (1) pay Hughes Electronics Corporation a $600.0 million
termination fee in certain circumstances and (2) acquire Hughes’ shareholder
interest in PanAmSat. The agreements to pay the termination fee and acquire
PanAmSat were required in the event that the merger with DirecTV was not
completed by January 21, 2003. During July 2003, the individual Board of
Director defendants were dismissed from the suit, and EchoStar was dismissed
during August 2003. The plaintiff did not file an appeal.

Enron Commercial Paper Investment Complaint

On November 6, 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, against approximately 100
defendants, including us, who invested in Enron’s commercial paper. The
complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 prepayment of its commercial paper
is a voidable preference under the bankruptcy laws and constitutes a fraudulent
conveyance. The complaint alleges that we received voidable or fraudulent
prepayments of approximately $40.0 million. We typically invest in commercial
paper and notes which are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by
at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. At the
time of our investment in Enron commercial paper, it was considered to be high
quality and considered to be a very low risk. It is too early to make an
assessment of the probable outcome of the litigation or to determine the extent
of any potential liability or damages.

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our
opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions
is unlikely to materially affect our financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

11. Segment Reporting

Financial Data by Business Unit

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS 131”) establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements of public business enterprises and requires that those
enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and
regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker(s) of an enterprise.
Under this definition we currently operate as two business units. The All
Other column consists of revenue from other satellite services and expenses
from other operating segments for which the disclosure requirements of FAS 131
do not apply.

We own 50% of NagraStar LLC (“NagraStar”), a joint venture that provides us
with smart cards. Nagra USA owns the other 50% of NagraStar. NagraStar
purchases these smart cards from NagraCard SA, a Swiss company which is an
affiliate of Nagra USA. Because we are not required to consolidate NagraStar,
but we do exercise significant influence, we accounted for our investment in
NagraStar under the equity method of accounting for all periods presented.
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we purchased from
NagraStar approximately $68.4 million, $56.2 million and $67.4 million,
respectively, for smart cards. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounts
payable to NagraStar totaled $7.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively.

15. Subsequent Events

9 3/8% Senior Note Redemption

Effective February 2, 2004, EDBS redeemed the remainder of its outstanding 9
3/8% Senior Notes due 2009. In accordance with the terms of the indenture
governing the notes, the remaining $1.423 billion principal amount of the notes
was repurchased at 104.688%, for a total of approximately $1.490 billion. The
premium paid of approximately $66.7 million, along with unamortized debt
issuance costs of approximately $10.8 million, were recorded as charges to
earnings in February 2004. As a result of this redemption, EDBS has been
discharged and released from their obligations under the related indenture.
Subsequent to the redemption, to satisfy insurance covenants under the next
most restrictive indentures related to EDBS’ remaining senior notes, we are
required to reclassify an amount equal to the depreciated cost of the lesser of
three
or half of our satellites. As an indirect result of this redemption, during

ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — Continued

February 2004, we were able to reclassify approximately $57.2 million
representing the depreciated cost of two of our satellites from cash reserved
for satellite insurance to cash and cash equivalents.

Gemstar-TV Guide International transaction

On March 2, 2004, we announced a long-term patent license and distribution
agreement with Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. This transaction includes
a one-time cash payment by us of $190.0 million for use of Gemstar intellectual
property and technology, use of the TV Guide brand on our interactive program
guides, and for distribution arrangements with Gemstar to provide for the
launch and carriage of the TV Guide Channel as well as the extension of an
existing distribution agreement for carriage of the TVG Network. We also
signed an agreement to resolve all outstanding litigation between us and
Gemstar.

Also on March 2, 2004, we announced an agreement to acquire Gemstar’s
Superstar/Netlink Group LLC (“SNG”), UVTV distribution, and SpaceCom businesses
and related assets for approximately $48.0 million in cash. Our purchase of
these businesses is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary
conditions. The effectiveness of the patent license, distribution agreements
and settlement agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the
closing of the SNG sale.
