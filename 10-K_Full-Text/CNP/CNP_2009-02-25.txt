Electric
Transmission & Distribution

In 1999,
the Texas legislature adopted the Texas Electric Choice Plan (Texas electric
restructuring law) that led to the restructuring of certain integrated electric
utilities operating within Texas. Pursuant to that legislation, integrated
electric utilities operating within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas,
Inc. (ERCOT) were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate
retail sales, power generation and transmission and distribution companies. The
legislation also required that the prices for wholesale generation and retail
electric sales be unregulated, but services by companies providing transmission
and distribution service, such as CenterPoint Houston, would



continue
to be regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility
Commission). The legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new
market structure and provided a true-up mechanism for the formerly integrated
electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from
the transition to competition. Those costs are recoverable after approval by the
Texas Utility Commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or
through the implementation of a competition transition charge (CTC) as a rider
to the utility’s tariff.

CenterPoint
Houston is the only business of CenterPoint Energy that continues to engage in
electric utility operations. It is a transmission and distribution electric
utility that operates wholly within the state of Texas. Neither CenterPoint
Houston nor any other subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy makes sales of electric
energy at retail or wholesale, or owns or operates any electric generating
facilities.

Electric
Transmission

On behalf
of retail electric providers (REPs), CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity
from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail
electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts (kV) in locations
throughout CenterPoint Houston’s certificated service territory. CenterPoint
Houston provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the Texas
Utility Commission.

Electric
Distribution

In ERCOT,
end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs.
CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service
area by carrying lower-voltage power from the substation to the retail electric
customer. CenterPoint Houston’s distribution network receives electricity from
the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers
electricity to end users through distribution feeders. CenterPoint Houston’s
operations include construction and maintenance of electric transmission and
distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and call
center operations. CenterPoint Houston provides distribution services under
tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Texas Utility Commission rules
and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies
and other market participants. Rates for these existing services are established
pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original
jurisdiction and the Texas Utility Commission.

ERCOT
Market Framework

CenterPoint
Houston is a member of ERCOT. ERCOT serves as the regional reliability
coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT
membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric
utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers
and REPs. The ERCOT market includes most of the State of Texas, other than a
portion of the panhandle, portions of the eastern part of the state bordering
Louisiana and the area in and around El Paso. The ERCOT market represents
approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s
largest power markets. The ERCOT market includes an aggregate net generating
capacity of approximately 73,000 megawatts (MW). There are only limited direct
current interconnections between the ERCOT market and other power markets in the
United States and Mexico.

The ERCOT
market operates under the reliability standards set by the North American
Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). These reliability standards are administered by
the Texas Regional Entity (TRE), a functionally independent division of ERCOT.
The Texas Utility Commission has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to
ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the state’s
main interconnected power transmission grid. The ERCOT independent system
operator (ERCOT ISO) is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply
system in the ERCOT market. Its responsibilities include ensuring that
electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the
generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike certain other
regional power markets, the ERCOT market is not a centrally dispatched power
pool, and the ERCOT ISO does not procure energy on behalf of its members other
than to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system. Members who
sell and purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and purchases of
power bilaterally. The ERCOT ISO also serves as agent for procuring ancillary
services for those members who elect not to provide their own ancillary
services.



CenterPoint
Houston’s electric transmission business, along with those of other owners of
transmission facilities in Texas, supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. The
transmission business has planning, design, construction, operation and
maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the
load-serving substations it owns, primarily within its certificated area.
CenterPoint Houston participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to
plan, design, obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission
lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove
existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.

Recovery
of True-Up Balance

The Texas
electric restructuring law substantially amended the regulatory structure
governing electric utilities in order to allow retail competition for electric
customers beginning in January 2002. The Texas electric restructuring law
required the Texas Utility Commission to conduct a “true-up” proceeding to
determine CenterPoint Houston’s stranded costs and certain other costs resulting
from the transition to a competitive retail electric market and to provide for
its recovery of those costs.

In March
2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas Utility
Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as
allowed under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004, the
Texas Utility Commission issued its final order (True-Up Order) allowing
CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance of approximately
$2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004, and
provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the
balance until recovery, along with the principal portion of additional excess
mitigation credits (EMCs) returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and
certain other adjustments.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district court
in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on the
various appeals. In its judgment, the district court:

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied recovery of a
      portion of the capacity auction true-up
amounts;

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston
      from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to REPs;
      and

•

affirmed
      the True-Up Order in all other
respects.

The
district court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately
$650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas Utility
Commission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initial
request.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas
Third Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In
its decision, the court of appeals:

•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity
      auction true-up amounts;

•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility
      Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to
      Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI);

•

ordered
      that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas
      Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility Commission;
      and

•

affirmed
      the district court’s judgment in all other
  respects.

In April
2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissued
substantially the same opinion as it had rendered in
December 2007.

In June
2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of the
court of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversal
of the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i)



denied
recovery of EMCs paid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true
up amounts allowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas Utility
Commission’s rulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 million
related to depreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s refusal
to permit CenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuation methodology
for determining the market value of its former generation assets. Two other
petitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by other parties to
the appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) the Texas Utility
Commission was without authority to fashion the methodology it used for valuing
the former generation assets after it had determined that CenterPoint Houston
could not use the partial stock valuation method, (ii) in fashioning the method
it used for valuing the former generating assets, the Texas Utility Commission
deprived parties of their due process rights and an opportunity to be heard,
(iii) the net book value of the generating assets should have been adjusted
downward due to the impact of a purchase option that had been granted to RRI,
(iv) CenterPoint Houston should not have been permitted to recover construction
work in progress balances without proving those amounts in the manner required
by law and (v) the Texas Utility Commission was without authority to award
interest on the capacity auction true up award.

Review by
the Texas Supreme Court of the court of appeals decision is at the discretion of
the court. In November 2008, the Texas Supreme Court requested the parties
to the Petitions for Review to submit briefs on the merits of the
issues raised. Briefing at the Texas Supreme Court should be completed in the
second quarter of 2009. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not indicated
whether it will grant review of the lower court’s decision, its
request for full briefing on the merits allowed the parties to more fully
explain their positions. There is no prescribed time in which the Texas Supreme
Court must determine whether to grant review or, if review is granted, for a
decision by that court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe that
CenterPoint Houston’s true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes and
regulations and, accordingly, that it is reasonably possible that it will be
successful in its appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, we can provide no assurance
as to the ultimate court rulings on the issues to be considered in the appeal or
with respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the tax
normalization issue described below.

To
reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a net
after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to the
district court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been
recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court of
appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further review by
the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record an
additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of that
loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax
normalization issue described below and the calculation of interest on any
amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required
to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the True-up Order, but could
range from $170 million to $385 million (pre-tax) plus interest
subsequent to December 31, 2008.

In the
True-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’s
stranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included in
the extraordinary loss discussed above, for the present value of certain
deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. We
believe that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed
regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in March 2003 that
would have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated before
March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass the benefits of
Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal
Income Taxes (EDFIT) back to customers. However, the IRS subsequently withdrew
those proposed normalization regulations and in March 2008 adopted final
regulations that would not permit utilities like CenterPoint Houston to pass the
tax benefits back to customers without creating normalization violations. In
addition, we received a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS in August 2007,
prior to adoption of the final regulations that confirmed that the Texas Utility
Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by
$146 million for ADITC and EDFIT would cause normalization violations with
respect to the ADITC and EDFIT.

If the
Texas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversed
or otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation,
the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint Houston’s
unamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization violation is
deemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston the
ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits beginning in the taxable
year that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. Such
treatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse impact on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash



flows in
addition to any potential loss resulting from final resolution of the True-Up
Order. In its opinion, the court of appeals ordered that this issue be remanded
to the Texas Utility Commission, as that commission requested. No party, in the
petitions for review or briefs filed with the Texas Supreme Court, has
challenged that order by the court of appeals, though the Texas Supreme Court,
if it grants review, will have authority to consider all aspects of the rulings
above, not just those challenged specifically by the appellants. We and
CenterPoint Houston will continue to pursue a favorable resolution of this issue
through the appellate or administrative process. Although the Texas Utility
Commission has not previously required a company subject to its jurisdiction to
take action that would result in a normalization violation, no prediction can be
made as to the ultimate action the Texas Utility Commission may take on this
issue on remand.

The Texas
electric restructuring law allowed the amounts awarded to CenterPoint Houston in
the Texas Utility Commission’s True-Up Order to be recovered either through
securitization or through implementation of a CTC or both. Pursuant to a
financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in March 2005 and
affirmed by a Travis County district court, in December 2005 a subsidiary
of CenterPoint Houston issued $1.85 billion in transition bonds with
interest rates ranging from 4.84% to 5.30% and final maturity dates ranging from
February 2011 to August 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds,
CenterPoint Houston recovered approximately $1.7 billion of the true-up
balance determined in the True-Up Order plus interest through the date on which
the bonds were issued.

In July
2005, CenterPoint Houston received an order from the Texas Utility Commission
allowing it to implement a CTC designed to collect the remaining
$596 million from the True-Up Order over 14 years plus interest at an
annual rate of 11.075% (CTC Order). The CTC Order authorized CenterPoint Houston
to impose a charge on REPs to recover the portion of the true-up balance not
recovered through a financing order. The CTC Order also allowed CenterPoint
Houston to collect approximately $24 million of rate case expenses over
three years without a return through a separate tariff rider (Rider RCE).
CenterPoint Houston implemented the CTC and Rider RCE effective
September 13, 2005 and began recovering approximately $620 million.
The return on the CTC portion of the true-up balance was included in CenterPoint
Houston’s tariff-based revenues beginning September 13, 2005. Effective
August 1, 2006, the interest rate on the unrecovered balance of the CTC was
reduced from 11.075% to 8.06% pursuant to a revised rule adopted by the Texas
Utility Commission in June 2006. Recovery of rate case expenses under Rider RCE
was completed in September 2008.

Certain
parties appealed the CTC Order to a district court in Travis County. In May
2006, the district court issued a judgment reversing the CTC Order in three
respects. First, the court ruled that the Texas Utility Commission had
improperly relied on provisions of its rule dealing with the interest rate
applicable to CTC amounts. The district court reached that conclusion based on
its belief that the Texas Supreme Court had previously invalidated that entire
section of the rule. The 11.075% interest rate in question was applicable from
the implementation of the CTC Order on September 13, 2005 until
August 1, 2006, the effective date of the implementation of a new CTC in
compliance with the revised rule discussed above. Second, the district court
reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that allows CenterPoint Houston
to recover through the Rider RCE the costs (approximately $5 million) for a
panel appointed by the Texas Utility Commission in connection with the valuation
of electric generation assets. Finally, the district court accepted the
contention of one party that the CTC should not be allocated to retail customers
that have switched to new on-site generation. The Texas Utility Commission and
CenterPoint Houston appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas
Third Court of Appeals, and in July 2008, the court of appeals reversed the
district court’s judgment in all respects and affirmed the Texas Utility
Commission’s order. Two of the appellants have requested further review from the
Texas Supreme Court. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted at
this time. However, the Company does not expect the disposition of this matter
to have a material adverse effect on our or CenterPoint Houston’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

During
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, CenterPoint Houston
recognized approximately $55 million, $42 million and $5 million,
respectively, in operating income from the CTC. Additionally, during the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, CenterPoint Houston recognized
approximately $13 million, $14 million and $13 million,
respectively, of the allowed equity return not previously recognized. As of
December 31, 2008, we have not recognized an allowed equity return of
$207 million on CenterPoint Houston’s true-up balance because such return
will be recognized as it is recovered in rates.

During the 2007 legislative session, the Texas legislature amended statutes
prescribing the types of true-up balances that can be securitized by utilities
and authorized the issuance of transition bonds to recover the balance of



the CTC.
In June 2007, CenterPoint Houston filed a request with the Texas Utility
Commission for a financing order that would allow the securitization of the
remaining balance of the CTC, adjusted to refund certain unspent environmental
retrofit costs and to recover the amount of the final fuel reconciliation
settlement. CenterPoint Houston reached substantial agreement with other parties
to this proceeding, and a financing order was approved by the Texas Utility
Commission in September 2007. In February 2008, pursuant to the financing order,
a new special purpose subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately
$488 million of transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of
4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates of February 2020 and February 2023,
respectively. Contemporaneously with the issuance of those bonds, the CTC was
terminated and a transition charge was implemented.

Hurricane
Ike

CenterPoint
Houston’s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of
Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast early Saturday,
September 13, 2008.

The
strong Category 2 storm initially left more than 90% of CenterPoint Houston’s
more than 2 million metered customers without power, the largest outage in
CenterPoint Houston’s 130-year history. Most of the widespread power outages
were due to power lines damaged by downed trees and debris blown by Hurricane
Ike’s winds. In addition, on Galveston Island and along the coastal areas of the
Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay, the storm surge and flooding from rains
accompanying the storm caused significant damage or destruction of houses and
businesses served by CenterPoint Houston.

CenterPoint
Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities
damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of $600 million
to $650 million. As is common with electric utilities serving coastal
regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole mounted equipment that
comprise CenterPoint Houston’s transmission and distribution system are not
covered by property insurance, but office buildings and warehouses and their
contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum
deductible of $10 million. Current estimates are that total losses to
property covered by this insurance were approximately
$17 million.

In
addition to storm restoration costs, CenterPoint Houston lost approximately
$17 million in revenue through December 31, 2008. Within the first 18
days after the storm, CenterPoint Houston had restored power to all customers
capable of receiving it.

CenterPoint
Houston has deferred the uninsured storm restoration costs as management
believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory
process. As a result, storm restoration costs did not affect our or CenterPoint
Houston’s reported net income for 2008. As of December 31, 2008,
CenterPoint Houston recorded an increase of $145 million in construction
work in progress and $435 million in regulatory assets for restoration
costs incurred through December 31, 2008. Approximately $73 million of
these costs are based on estimates and are included in accounts payable as of
December 31, 2008. Additional restoration costs will continue to be
incurred in 2009.

Assuming
necessary enabling legislation is enacted by the Texas Legislature in the
session that began in January 2009, CenterPoint Houston expects to seek a
financing order from the Texas Utility Commission to obtain recovery of its
storm restoration costs through the issuance of non-recourse securitization
bonds similar to the storm recovery bonds issued by another Texas utility
following the hurricanes that affected that utility’s service territories in
2005. Assuming those bonds are issued, CenterPoint Houston will recover the
amount of storm restoration costs determined by the Texas Utility Commission to
have been prudently incurred out of the bond proceeds, with the bonds being
repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. Alternatively, if
securitization is not available, recovery of those costs would be sought through
traditional regulatory mechanisms. Under its 2006 rate case settlement,
CenterPoint Houston is entitled to seek an adjustment to rates in this
situation, even though in most instances its rates are frozen until
2010.



Customers

CenterPoint
Houston serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston metropolitan area.
CenterPoint Houston’s customers consist of 79 REPs, which sell electricity to
over 2 million metered customers in CenterPoint Houston’s certificated
service area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other distribution
companies located outside CenterPoint Houston’s certificated service area. Each
REP is licensed by, and must meet minimal creditworthiness criteria established
by, the Texas Utility Commission. Two of the REPs in CenterPoint Houston’s
service area are subsidiaries of RRI. Sales to subsidiaries of RRI represented
approximately 56%, 51% and 48% of CenterPoint Houston’s transmission and
distribution revenues in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. CenterPoint
Houston’s billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2008 was
$141 million. Approximately 46% of this amount was owed by subsidiaries of
RRI. CenterPoint Houston does not have long-term contracts with any of its
customers. It operates on a continuous billing cycle, with meter readings being
conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day.

Advanced
Metering System and Distribution Automation (Intelligent Grid)

In
December 2008, CenterPoint Houston received approval from the Texas Utility
Commission to deploy an advanced metering system (AMS) across its service
territory over the next five years. CenterPoint Houston plans to begin
installing advanced meters in March 2009. This innovative technology should
encourage greater energy conservation by giving Houston-area electric consumers
the ability to better monitor and manage their electric use and its cost in near
real time. CenterPoint Houston will recover the cost for the AMS through a
monthly surcharge to all REPs over 12 years. The surcharge for each residential
consumer for the first 24 months, beginning in February 2009, will be $3.24 per
month; thereafter, the surcharge is scheduled to be reduced to $3.05 per month.
These amounts are subject to upward or downward adjustment in future proceedings
to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope.
CenterPoint Houston projects capital expenditures of approximately
$640 million for the installation of the advanced meters and corresponding
communication and data management systems over the five-year deployment
period.

CenterPoint
Houston is also pursuing possible deployment of an electric distribution grid
automation strategy that involves the implementation of an “Intelligent Grid”
which would make use of CenterPoint Houston’s facilities to provide on-demand
data and information about the status of facilities on its system. Although this
technology is still in the developmental stage, CenterPoint Houston believes it
has the potential to provide a significant improvement in grid planning,
operations and maintenance of the CenterPoint Houston distribution system. These
improvements would be expected to contribute to fewer and shorter outages,
better customer service, improved operations costs, improved security and more
effective use of our workforce. Texas Utility Commission approval and
appropriate rate treatment would be sought in connection with any actual
deployment of this technology.

Competition

There are
no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in CenterPoint
Houston’s service area. In order for another provider of transmission and
distribution services to provide such services in CenterPoint Houston’s
territory, it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and
necessity from the Texas Utility Commission and, depending on the location of
the facilities, may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more
municipalities. We know of no other party intending to enter this business in
CenterPoint Houston’s service area at this time.

Seasonality

A
significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that
it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on
behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of
operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in
electricity usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer
months.

Properties

All of
CenterPoint Houston’s properties are located in Texas. Its properties consist
primarily of high voltage electric transmission lines and poles, distribution
lines, substations, service wires and meters. Most of CenterPoint



Houston’s
transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others
pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets as permitted by
law.

All real
and tangible properties of CenterPoint Houston, subject to certain exclusions,
are currently subject to:

•

the
      lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) dated November 1,
      1944, as supplemented; and

•

the
      lien of a General Mortgage (the General Mortgage) dated October 10,
      2002, as supplemented, which is junior to the lien of the
      Mortgage.

As of
December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately
$2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds under the
General Mortgage, including approximately $527 million held in trust to
secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated,
$600 million securing borrowings under a credit facility which was
unutilized and approximately $229 million held in trust to secure pollution
control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally,
CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately $253 million aggregate
principal amount of first mortgage bonds under the Mortgage, including
approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution
control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. CenterPoint Houston may
issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of
property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately
$1.8 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds
in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of
property additions as of December 31, 2008. However, CenterPoint Houston
has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds,
subject to certain exceptions. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued
$500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds in a
public offering.

Electric Lines —
Overhead.

As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston
owned 27,603 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 3,727 circuit miles
of overhead transmission lines, including 423 circuit miles operated at 69,000
volts, 2,088 circuit miles operated at 138,000 volts and 1,216 circuit miles
operated at 345,000 volts.

Electric Lines —
Underground.

As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston
owned 19,690 circuit miles of underground distribution lines and 26 circuit
miles of underground transmission lines, including 2 circuit miles operated at
69,000 volts and 24 circuit miles operated at 138,000 volts.

Substations.

As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston
owned 229 major substation sites having a total installed rated transformer
capacity of 51,400 megavolt amperes.

Service
Centers.

CenterPoint Houston operates 14 regional service
centers located on a total of 291 acres of land. These service centers
consist of office buildings, warehouses and repair facilities that are used in
the business of transmitting and distributing electricity.

Franchises

CenterPoint
Houston holds non-exclusive franchises from the incorporated municipalities in
its service territory. In exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises
give CenterPoint Houston the right to use the streets and public rights-of way
of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and
distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery
business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the
franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to
50 years.

Natural
Gas Distribution

CERC
Corp.’s natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations) engages in regulated
intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for,
approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers
in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The largest
metropolitan areas served in each state by Gas Operations are Houston, Texas;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Biloxi,
Mississippi; and Lawton, Oklahoma. In 2008, approximately 43% of Gas Operations’
total throughput was to residential customers and approximately 57% was to
commercial and industrial customers.



Gas
Operations also provides unregulated services consisting of heating, ventilating
and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and appliance repair, and sales of HVAC,
hearth and water heating equipment in Minnesota.

The
demand for intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for,
residential, commercial and industrial customers is seasonal. In 2008,
approximately 71% of the total throughput of Gas Operations’ business occurred
in the first and fourth quarters. These patterns reflect the higher demand for
natural gas for heating purposes during those periods.

Gas
Operations also suffered some damage to its system in Houston, Texas and in
other portions of its service territory across Texas and Louisiana as a result
of Hurricane Ike. As of December 31, 2008, Gas Operations has deferred
approximately $4 million of costs related to Hurricane Ike for recovery as
part of future natural gas distribution rate proceedings.

Supply and
Transportation.

In 2008, Gas Operations purchased virtually
all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying
from a few months to four years. Major suppliers in 2008 included BP Canada
Energy Marketing Corp. (13.4% of supply volumes), Tenaska Marketing Ventures
(11.5%), Oneok Energy Marketing (10.2%), Coral Energy Resources (6.6%) and
Cargill, Inc. (5.8%). Numerous other suppliers provided the remaining 52.5% of
Gas Operations’ natural gas supply requirements. Gas Operations transports its
natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines,
including those owned by our other subsidiaries, under contracts with remaining
terms, including extensions, varying from one to fifteen years. Gas Operations
anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed
or replaced prior to their expiration.

We
actively engage in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply
plans presented to and/or filed with each of our state regulatory authorities.
These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas, contractually
establishing fixed prices with our physical gas suppliers and utilizing
financial derivative instruments to achieve a variety of pricing structures
(e.g., fixed price, costless collars and caps). Our gas supply plans generally
call for 25-50% of winter supplies to be hedged in some fashion.

Generally,
the regulations of the states in which Gas Operations operates allow it to pass
through changes in the cost of natural gas, including gains and losses on
financial derivatives associated with the index-priced physical supply, to its
customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs. Depending
upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated
periodically, ranging from monthly to semi-annually, using estimated gas costs.
The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the
applicable regulatory bodies.

Gas
Operations uses various third-party storage services or owned natural gas
storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes
in demand due to changes in weather and may also supplement contracted supplies
and storage from time to time with stored liquefied natural gas and propane-air
plant production.

Gas
Operations owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a
capacity of 7.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf). It has a working capacity of 2.0
Bcf available for use during a normal heating season and a maximum daily
withdrawal rate of 50 million cubic feet (MMcf). It also owns nine
propane-air plants with a total production rate of 200 MMcf per day and
on-site storage facilities for 12 million gallons of propane (1.0 Bcf
natural gas equivalent). It owns liquefied natural gas plant facilities with a
12 million-gallon liquefied natural gas storage tank (1.0 Bcf natural
gas equivalent) and a production rate of 72 MMcf per day.

On an
ongoing basis, Gas Operations enters into contracts to provide sufficient
supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements. However, it is
possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to
weather conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a result of
these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time,
or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or
other factors.

Assets

As of
December 31, 2008, Gas Operations owned approximately 70,000 linear miles
of natural gas distribution mains, varying in size from one-half inch to
24 inches in diameter. Generally, in each of the cities, towns and
rural



areas
served by Gas Operations, it owns the underground gas mains and service lines,
metering and regulating equipment located on customers’ premises and the
district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance. With a few
exceptions, the measuring stations at which Gas Operations receives gas are
owned, operated and maintained by others, and its distribution facilities begin
at the outlet of the measuring equipment. These facilities, including odorizing
equipment, are usually located on the land owned by
suppliers.

Competition

Gas
Operations competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity
and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other gas
distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end-users. In
addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines,
natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Gas
Operations’ facilities and market and sell and/or transport natural gas directly
to commercial and industrial customers.

Competitive
Natural Gas Sales and Services

CERC
offers variable and fixed-priced physical natural gas supplies primarily to
commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities through
CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES) and its subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy
Intrastate Pipelines, LLC (CEIP).

In 2008,
CES marketed approximately 528 Bcf of natural gas, transportation and
related energy services to approximately 9,700 customers (including
approximately 9 Bcf to affiliates). CES customers vary in size from small
commercial customers to large utility companies in the central and eastern
regions of the United States, and are served from offices located in Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas and
Wisconsin. The business has three operational functions: wholesale, retail and
intrastate pipelines, which are further described below.

Wholesale
Operations.

CES offers a portfolio of physical delivery
services and financial products designed to meet wholesale customers’ supply and
price risk management needs. These customers are served directly through
interconnects with various inter- and intra-state pipeline companies, and
include gas utilities, large industrial customers and electric generation
customers.

Retail
Operations.

CES offers a variety of natural gas management
services to smaller commercial and industrial customers, municipalities,
educational institutions and hospitals, whose facilities are located downstream
of natural gas distribution utility city gate stations. These services include
load forecasting, supply acquisition, daily swing volume management, invoice
consolidation, storage asset management, firm and interruptible transportation
administration and forward price management. CES manages transportation
contracts and energy supply for retail customers in sixteen states.

Intrastate Pipeline
Operations.

CEIP primarily provides transportation services to
shippers and end-users and contracts out approximately 2.3 Bcf of storage at its
Pierce Junction facility in Texas.

CES
currently transports natural gas on over 32 interstate and intrastate pipelines
within states located throughout the central and eastern United States. CES
maintains a portfolio of natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation
and storage agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its customers.
CES aggregates supply from various producing regions and offers contracts to buy
natural gas with terms ranging from one month to over five years. In addition,
CES actively participates in the spot natural gas markets in an effort to
balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations. Natural gas supply
and transportation capabilities are leveraged through contracts for ancillary
services including physical storage and other balancing
arrangements.

As
described above, CES offers its customers a variety of load following services.
In providing these services, CES uses its customers’ purchase commitments to
forecast and arrange its own supply purchases, storage and

transportation
services to serve customers’ natural gas requirements. As a result of the
variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity, CES
will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers’
purchase commitments. These supply imbalances arise each month as customers’
natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies
are nominated by CES for delivery to those



customers.
CES’ processes and risk control environment are designed to measure and value
imbalances on a real-time basis to ensure that CES’ exposure to commodity price
risk is kept to a minimum. The value assigned to these imbalances is calculated
daily and is known as the aggregate Value at Risk (VaR). In 2008, CES’ VaR
averaged $1.5 million with a high of $2.8 million.

The
CenterPoint Energy risk control policy, governed by our Risk Oversight
Committee, defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading
limits. CES is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools,
including pipeline and storage capacity, financial instruments and physical
commodity purchase contracts to support its sales. The CES business optimizes
its use of these various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage
in proprietary or speculative commodity trading. The VaR limits within which CES
operates are consistent with its operational objective of matching its aggregate
sales obligations (including the swing associated with load following services)
with its supply portfolio in a manner that minimizes its total cost of
supply.

Assets

CEIP owns
and operates approximately 227 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana
and Texas and holds storage facilities of approximately 2.3 Bcf in Texas
under long-term leases. In addition, CES leases transportation capacity of
approximately 1.1 Bcf per day on various inter- and intrastate pipelines
and approximately 8.8 Bcf of storage to service its customer
base.

Competition

CES
competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas marketers including
the marketing divisions of natural gas producers and utilities. In addition, CES
competes with intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market
areas.

Interstate
Pipelines

CERC’s
pipelines business operates interstate natural gas pipelines with gas
transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Texas. CERC’s interstate pipeline operations are primarily
conducted by two wholly owned subsidiaries that provide gas transportation and
storage services primarily to industrial customers and local distribution
companies:

•

CenterPoint
      Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT) is an interstate pipeline that
      provides natural gas transportation, natural gas storage and pipeline
      services to customers principally in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
      Texas; and

•

CenterPoint
      Energy-Mississippi River Transmission Corporation (MRT) is an interstate
      pipeline that provides natural gas transportation, natural gas storage and
      pipeline services to customers principally in Arkansas and
      Missouri.

The rates
charged by CEGT and MRT for interstate transportation and storage services are
regulated by the FERC. Our interstate pipelines business operations may be
affected by changes in the demand for natural gas, the available supply and
relative price of natural gas in the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas
supply regions and general economic conditions.

In 2008,
approximately 15% of CEGT and MRT’s total operating revenue was attributable to
services provided to Gas Operations, an affiliate, and approximately 7% was
attributable to services provided to Laclede Gas Company (Laclede), an
unaffiliated distribution company, that provides natural gas utility service to
the greater St. Louis metropolitan area in Illinois and Missouri. Services to
Gas Operations and Laclede are provided under several long-term firm storage and
transportation agreements. Effective April 1, 2008, MRT signed a 5-year
extension of its firm transportation and storage contracts with Laclede.
Agreements for firm transportation, “no notice” transportation

service
and storage services in certain of Gas Operations’ service areas (Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas) will expire in 2012.



Carthage to
Perryville.

In April 2008, CEGT completed the Phase III
expansion of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline. This expansion included
additional compression and authorization from the Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to operate the line at higher pressures.
The Carthage to Perryville pipeline can now operate at up to 1.5 Bcf per day.
CEGT filed with FERC on December 5, 2008 to increase the Carthage to Perryville
capacity to approximately 1.9 Bcf per day. The expansion includes a new
compressor unit at two of CEGT’s existing stations and is currently projected to
be placed in service in the second quarter of 2010.

Southeast Supply
Header.

The Southeast Supply Header (SESH) pipeline project, a
joint venture between CEGT and Spectra Energy Corp., was placed into commercial
service on September 6, 2008. This new 270-mile pipeline, which extends from the
Perryville Hub, near Perryville, Louisiana, to an interconnection with the Gulf
Stream Natural Gas System near Mobile, Alabama, has a maximum design capacity of
approximately one Bcf per day. The pipeline represents a new source of natural
gas supply for the Southeast United States and offers greater supply diversity
to this region. Our share of SESH’s net construction costs is approximately
$625 million.

Assets

Our
interstate pipelines business currently owns and operates approximately 8,000
miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois,
Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. We also own and operate six natural gas
storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately
1.2 Bcf and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. We
also own a 10% interest in the Bistineau storage facility located in Bienville
Parish, Louisiana, with the remaining interest owned and operated by Gulf South
Pipeline Company, LP. Our storage capacity in the Bistineau facility is
8 Bcf of working gas with 100 MMcf per day of deliverability. Most
storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma.

Competition

Our
interstate pipelines business competes with other interstate and intrastate
pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal
elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, and
flexibility and reliability of service. Our interstate pipelines business
competes indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and
fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability
of energy and pipeline capacity, the level of business activity, conservation
and governmental regulations, the capability to convert to alternative fuels,
and other factors, including weather, affect the demand for natural gas in areas
we serve and the level of competition for transportation and storage
services.

Field
Services

CERC’s
field services business operates gas gathering, treating, and processing
facilities and also provides operating and technical services and remote data
monitoring and communication services.

CERC’s
field services operations are conducted by a wholly owned subsidiary,
CenterPoint Energy Field Services, Inc. (CEFS). CEFS provides natural gas
gathering and processing services for certain natural gas fields in the
Mid-continent region of the United States that interconnect with CEGT’s and
MRT’s pipelines, as well as other interstate and intrastate pipelines. CEFS
gathers approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of natural gas and, either directly or
through its 50% interest in a joint venture, processes in excess of
240 MMcf per day of natural gas along its gathering system. CEFS, through
its ServiceStar operating division, provides remote data monitoring and
communications services to affiliates and third parties.

Our field
services business operations may be affected by changes in the demand for
natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), the available supply and relative
price of natural gas and NGLs in the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas
supply regions and general economic conditions.

Assets

Our field
services business owns and operates approximately 3,600 miles of gathering
pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas from
approximately 150 separate systems located in major producing fields in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.



Competition

Our field
services business competes with other companies in the natural gas gathering,
treating, and processing business. The principal elements of competition are
rates, terms of service and reliability of services. Our field services business
competes indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and
fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability
of energy and pipeline capacity, the level of business activity, conservation
and governmental regulations, the capability to convert to alternative fuels,
and other factors, including weather, affect the demand for natural gas in areas
we serve and the level of competition for gathering, treating, and processing
services. In addition, competition among forms of energy is impacted by
commodity pricing levels and influences the level of drilling activity and
demand for our gathering operations.

Other
Operations

Our Other
Operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used
in our business operations and other corporate operations that support all of
our business operations.

Financial
Information About Segments

For
financial information about our segments, see Note 14 to our consolidated
financial statements, which note is incorporated herein by

REGULATION

We are
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies,
including the regulations described below.

Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission

The FERC
has jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978, as amended, to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate
commerce and natural gas sales for resale in intrastate commerce that are not
first sales. The FERC regulates, among other things, the construction of
pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of
natural gas in interstate commerce, including the extension, expansion or
abandonment of these facilities. The rates charged by interstate pipelines for
interstate transportation and storage services are also regulated by the FERC.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) expanded the FERC’s authority to
prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERC-regulated transactions and
gave the FERC additional authority to impose significant civil and criminal
penalties for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders
and also expanded criminal penalties for such violations. Our competitive
natural gas sales and services subsidiary markets natural gas in interstate
commerce pursuant to blanket authority granted by the FERC.

Our
natural gas pipeline subsidiaries may periodically file applications with the
FERC for changes in their generally available maximum rates and charges designed
to allow them to recover their costs of providing service to customers (to the
extent allowed by prevailing market conditions), including a reasonable rate of
return. These rates are normally allowed to become effective after a suspension
period and, in some cases, are subject to refund under applicable law until such
time as the FERC issues an order on the allowable level of rates.

CenterPoint
Houston is not a “public utility” under the Federal Power Act and, therefore, is
not generally regulated by the FERC, although certain of its transactions are
subject to limited FERC jurisdiction. The Energy Act conferred new jurisdiction
and responsibilities on the FERC with respect to ensuring the reliability of
electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by
CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. Under this authority, the
FERC has designated the NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to

promulgate
standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk
power system (Electric Entities). The ERO and the FERC have authority to impose
fines and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply with the
standards. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for
reliability in ERCOT to the TRE. CenterPoint Houston does not anticipate that
the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will
have a material adverse impact on its operations. To the extent that CenterPoint



Houston
is required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards, it
is anticipated that CenterPoint Houston will seek to recover those costs through
the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers
within ERCOT for electric transmission provided.

Under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the FERC has authority
to require holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain certain books
and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory
authorities in certain circumstances. In December 2005, the FERC issued
rules implementing PUHCA 2005. Pursuant to those rules, in June 2006, we filed
with the FERC the required notification of our status as a public utility
holding company. In October 2006, the FERC adopted additional rules regarding
maintenance of books and records by utility holding companies and additional
reporting and accounting requirements for centralized service companies that
make allocations to public utilities regulated by the FERC under the Federal
Power Act. Although we provide services to our subsidiaries through a service
company, our service company is not subject to the FERC’s service company
rules.

State
and Local Regulation

Electric
Transmission & Distribution

CenterPoint
Houston conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and
necessity issued by the Texas Utility Commission that covers its present service
area and facilities. The Texas Utility Commission and those municipalities that
have retained original jurisdiction have the authority to set the rates and
terms of service provided by CenterPoint Houston under cost of service rate
regulation. CenterPoint Houston holds non-exclusive franchises from the
incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for payment of
fees, these franchises give CenterPoint Houston the right to use the streets and
public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain
its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its
electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit.
The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from
30 to 50 years.

CenterPoint
Houston’s distribution rates charged to REPs for residential customers are based
on amounts of energy delivered, whereas distribution rates for a majority of
commercial and industrial customers are based on peak demand. All REPs in
CenterPoint Houston’s service area pay the same rates and other charges for the
same transmission and distribution services. Transmission rates charged to other
distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under “postage
stamp” rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted.
All distribution companies in ERCOT pay CenterPoint Houston the same rates and
other charges for transmission services. This regulated delivery charge includes
the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal franchise
fees), a system benefit fund fee imposed by the Texas electric restructuring
law, a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South
Texas nuclear generating facility and transition charges associated with
securitization of regulatory assets and securitization of stranded
costs.

Recovery of True-Up
Balance.

For a discussion of CenterPoint Houston’s true-up
proceedings, see “— Our Business — Electric Transmission & Distribution —
Recovery of True-Up Balance” above.

CenterPoint Houston Interim
Transmission Costs of Service Update.

In September 2008,
CenterPoint Houston filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission
requesting an interim update to its wholesale transmission rate. The filing
resulted in a revenue requirement increase of $22.5 million over rates then
in effect. Approximately 74% will be paid by distribution companies other than
CenterPoint Houston. The remaining 26% represents CenterPoint Houston’s share.
That amount cannot be included in rates until 2010 under the terms of the rate
freeze implemented in the settlement of CenterPoint Houston’s 2006 rate
proceeding described below. In November 2008, the Texas Utility Commission
approved CenterPoint Houston’s request. The interim rates became effective for
service on and after November 5, 2008.

CenterPoint Houston Rate
Agreement

.  CenterPoint Houston’s transmission and distribution
rates are subject to the terms of a Settlement Agreement effective in October
2006. The Settlement Agreement provides that until June 30, 2010
CenterPoint Houston will not seek to increase its base rates and the other
parties will not petition to decrease those rates. The rate freeze is subject to
adjustment for certain limited matters, including the results of the appeals of
the True-Up Order, the implementation of charges associated with
securitizations, the impact of severe



weather
such as hurricanes and certain other force majeure events. CenterPoint Houston
must make a new base rate filing not later than June 30, 2010, based on a test
year ended December 31, 2009, unless the staff of the Texas Utility
Commission and certain cities notify it that such a filing is
unnecessary.

Natural
Gas Distribution

In almost
all communities in which Gas Operations provides natural gas distribution
services, it operates under franchises, certificates or licenses obtained from
state and local authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various
expiration dates, typically range from 10 to 30 years, although franchises
in Arkansas are perpetual. Gas Operations expects to be able to renew expiring
franchises. In most cases, franchises to provide natural gas utility services
are not exclusive.

Substantially
all of Gas Operations is subject to cost-of-service regulation by the relevant
state public utility commissions and, in Texas, by the Railroad Commission of
Texas (Railroad Commission) and those municipalities Gas Operations serves that
have retained original jurisdiction.

In March
2008, Gas Operations filed a request to change its rates with the Railroad
Commission and the 47 cities in its Texas Coast service territory, an area
consisting of approximately 230,000 customers in cities and communities on the
outskirts of Houston. The request sought to establish uniform rates, charges and
terms and conditions of service for the cities and environs of the Texas Coast
service territory. Of the 47 cities, 23 either affirmatively approved or allowed
the filed rates to go into effect by operation of law. Nine other cities were
represented by the Texas Coast Utilities Coalition (TCUC) and 15 cities were
represented by the Gulf Coast Coalition of Cities (GCCC). In July 2008, Gas
Operations reached a settlement agreement with the GCCC. That settlement
agreement, if implemented across the entire Texas Coast service territory, would
allow Gas Operations a $3.4 million annual increase in revenues. The TCUC
cities denied the rate change request and Gas Operations appealed the denial of
rates to the Railroad Commission. The Railroad Commission issued an order in
October 2008, which, if implemented across the entire Texas Coast service
territory, would result in an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million. Both
the Railroad Commission order and the settlement provide for an annual rate
adjustment mechanism to reflect changes in operating expenses and revenues as
well as changes in capital investment and associated changes in revenue-related
taxes. In December 2008, the Railroad Commission issued an order on
rehearing. Parties have filed second motions for rehearing on this order.
However, in December 2008, Gas Operations implemented the approved rates
for the nine TCUC cities and the environs, subject to refund. The impact of the
Railroad Commission’s order on rehearing on the settled rates is still under
review, and how rates will be conformed among all cities in the Texas Coast
service territory is unknown at this time. A final decision from the Railroad
Commission regarding the second motions for rehearing is expected no later than
March 2009.

Minnesota.

In
November 2006, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) denied a request
filed by Gas Operations for a waiver of MPUC rules in order to allow Gas
Operations to recover approximately $21 million in unrecovered purchased
gas costs related to periods prior to July 1, 2004. Those unrecovered gas
costs were identified as a result of revisions to previously approved
calculations of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Following that denial, Gas
Operations recorded a $21 million adjustment to reduce pre-tax earnings in
the fourth quarter of 2006 and reduced the regulatory asset related to these
costs by an equal amount. In March 2007, following the MPUC’s denial of
reconsideration of its ruling, Gas Operations petitioned the Minnesota Court of
Appeals for review of the MPUC’s decision, and in May 2008 that court ruled that
the MPUC had been arbitrary and capricious in denying Gas Operations a waiver.
The court ordered the case remanded to the MPUC for reconsideration under the
same principles the MPUC had applied in previously granted waiver requests. The
MPUC sought further review of the court of appeals decision from the Minnesota
Supreme Court, and in July 2008, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to review
the decision. In January 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court heard oral arguments.
While there is no deadline for a decision, a decision is expected by the end of
the third quarter of 2009. While no prediction can be

made as
to the ultimate outcome, this matter will have no negative impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
November 2008, Gas Operations filed a request with the MPUC to increase its
rates for utility distribution service. If approved by the MPUC, the proposed
new rates would result in an overall increase in annual revenue of
$59.8 million. The proposed increase would allow Gas Operations to recover
increased operating costs, including higher bad debt and collection expenses,
the cost of improved customer service and inflationary increases in
other



expenses.
It also would allow recovery of increased costs related to conservation
improvement programs and provide a return for the additional capital invested to
serve its customers. In addition, Gas Operations is seeking an adjustment
mechanism that would annually adjust rates to reflect changes in use per
customer. In December 2008, the MPUC accepted the case and approved an
interim rate increase of $51.2 million, which became effective on January
2, 2009, subject to refund. The MPUC is allowed ten months to issue a final
decision; however, an extension of time can occur in certain
circumstances.

Department
of Transportation

In
December 2006, Congress enacted the Pipeline Inspection, Protection,
Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (2006 Act), which reauthorized the programs
adopted under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (2002 Act). These
programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety, and
a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in
areas of high population concentration. Under the legislation, remediation
activities are to be performed over a 10-year period. Our pipeline subsidiaries
are on schedule to comply with the timeframe mandated for completion of
integrity assessment and remediation.

Pursuant
to the 2002 Act, and then the 2006 Act, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has
adopted a number of rules concerning, among other things, distinguishing between
gathering lines and transmission facilities, requiring certain design and
construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and
requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and
maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs.

We
anticipate that compliance with these regulations and performance of the
remediation activities by CERC’s interstate and intrastate pipelines, and
natural gas distribution companies will require increases in both capital
expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon
several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the
facilities. Based on our interpretation of the rules written to date and
preliminary technical reviews, we believe compliance will require annual
expenditures (capital and operating costs combined) of approximately $17 to
24 million during the initial 10-year period.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

Our
operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining
to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas
pipelines, gas gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and
distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the
federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or
impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

•

restricting
      the way we can handle or dispose of
wastes;

•

limiting
      or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as
      wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered
      species;

•

requiring
      remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations,
      or attributable to former operations;
and

•

enjoining
      the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued
      pursuant to such environmental laws and
  regulations.

In order
to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and
devote other resources from time to time to:

•

construct
      or acquire new equipment;

•

acquire
      permits for facility operations;

•

modify
      or replace existing and proposed equipment;
and



•

clean
      up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management
      facilities and other locations and
facilities.

Failure
to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of
administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the
assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the
issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes
impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and
restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise
released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the
environment.

The trend
in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on
activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance
as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance
or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts
we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements
that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing
environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such
compliance.

Based on
current regulatory requirements and interpretations, we do not believe that
compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that our current environmental
remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational
ability. We cannot assure you, however, that future events, such as changes in
existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of
new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. The
following is a discussion of all material environmental and safety laws and
regulations that relate to our operations. We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations.

Global
Climate Change

In recent years, there has been
increasing public debate regarding the potential impact on global climate change
by various “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning
fossil fuels, and methane, the principal component of the natural gas that we
transport and deliver to customers. Legislation to regulate emissions of
greenhouse gases has been introduced in Congress, and there has been a
wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the
impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Some of the
proposals would require industries such as the utility industry to meet
stringent new standards requiring substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. Some proposals
would provide for credits to those who reduce emissions below certain levels and
would allow those credits to be traded and/or sold to others. While there is
growing consensus that some form of global climate change program will be
adopted, it is too early to determine when, and in what form, a regulatory
scheme regarding greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted or what specific
impacts a new regulatory scheme might have on us and our subsidiaries. However,
as a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in
its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s revenues, operating costs and
capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory
scheme that would reduce consumption of natural gas if ultimately adopted. Our
electric transmission and distribution business, unlike most electric utilities,
does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of
high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities
that are in the business of generating electricity. Nevertheless, CenterPoint
Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting
regulatory scheme has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by
ultimate consumers within its service territory

.

Air
Emissions

Our
operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws
and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants
from various industrial sources, including our processing plants and compressor
stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such
laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the
construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to
produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions,
obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and
operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies
to



limit
emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to
monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and
potentially criminal enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain
capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in
connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for
air emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be materially
adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected
to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated
companies.

Water
Discharges

Our
operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as
amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict
controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States.
The unpermitted discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a
spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and regulations
implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in
wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an
appropriately issued permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other
pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties
as well as significant remedial obligations.

Hazardous
Waste

Our
operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to
the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state
laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment
and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural
gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous
waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters
produced and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or
production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration
and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent
non-hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes
such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste compressor
oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The transportation of natural gas in
pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA
or comparable state law requirements.

Liability
for Remediation

The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended (CERCLA), also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose
liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on
certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances
into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past
owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and
companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at
offsite locations such as landfills. Although petroleum, as well as natural gas,
is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course
of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the
definition of a “hazardous substance.” CERCLA authorizes the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some cases, third parties to take
action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to
seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.
Under CERCLA, we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs
of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been
released, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health
studies.

Liability
for Preexisting Conditions

Manufactured Gas Plant
Sites.

CERC and its predecessors operated manufactured gas
plants (MGPs) in the past. In Minnesota, CERC has completed remediation on two
sites, other than ongoing monitoring and water treatment. There are five
remaining sites in CERC’s Minnesota service territory. CERC believes that it has
no liability with respect to two of these sites.

At
December 31, 2008, CERC had accrued $14 million for remediation of
these Minnesota sites and the estimated range of possible remediation costs for
these sites was $4 million to $35 million based on remediation
continuing for 30 to 50 years. The cost estimates are based on studies of a site
or industry average costs for



remediation
of sites of similar size. The actual remediation costs will be dependent upon
the number of sites to be remediated, the participation of other potentially
responsible parties (PRPs), if any, and the remediation methods used. CERC has
utilized an environmental expense tracker mechanism in its rates in Minnesota to
recover estimated costs in excess of insurance recovery. As of December 31,
2008, CERC had collected $13 million from insurance companies and rate
payers to be used for future environmental remediation.

In
addition to the Minnesota sites, the EPA and other regulators have investigated
MGP sites that were owned or operated by CERC or may have been owned by one of
its former affiliates. CERC has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in
the United States District Court, District of Maine, under which contribution is
sought by private parties for the cost to remediate former MGP sites based on
the previous ownership of such sites by former affiliates of CERC or its
divisions. CERC has also been identified as a PRP by the State of Maine for a
site that is the subject of the lawsuit. In June 2006, the federal district
court in Maine ruled that the current owner of the site is responsible for site
remediation but that an additional evidentiary hearing is required to determine
if other potentially responsible parties, including CERC, would have to
contribute to that remediation. CERC is investigating details regarding the site
and the range of environmental expenditures for potential remediation. However,
CERC believes it is not liable as a former owner or operator of the site under
CERCLA, and applicable state statutes, and is vigorously contesting the suit and
its designation as a PRP.

Mercury
Contamination.

Our pipeline and distribution operations have
in the past employed elemental mercury in measuring and regulating equipment. It
is possible that small amounts of mercury may have been spilled in the course of
normal maintenance and replacement operations and that these spills may have
contaminated the immediate area with elemental mercury. We have found this type
of contamination at some sites in the past, and we have conducted remediation at
these sites. It is possible that other contaminated sites may exist and that
remediation costs may be incurred for these sites. Although the total amount of
these costs is not known at this time, based on our experience and that of
others in the natural gas industry to date and on the current regulations
regarding remediation of these sites, we believe that the costs of any
remediation of these sites will not be material to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos.

Some
facilities owned by us contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other
asbestos-containing materials. We or our subsidiaries have been named, along
with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of
individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants
have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to
facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional
claims like those received may be asserted in the future. In 2004, we sold our
generating business, to which most of these claims relate, to Texas Genco LLC,
which is now known as NRG Texas LP. Under the terms of the arrangements
regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale to NRG
Texas LP, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims
relating to the generating business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but we
have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by
insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such
defense from the purchaser. Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted
at this time, we intend to continue vigorously contesting claims that we do not
consider to have merit and do not expect, based on our experience to date, these
matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

Groundwater Contamination
Litigation.

Predecessor entities of CERC, along with several
other entities, are defendants in litigation,

St. Michel Plantation, LLC, et al,
v. White, et al

., pending in civil district court in Orleans Parish,
Louisiana. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that their property in
Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana suffered

salt
water contamination as a result of oil and gas drilling activities conducted by
the defendants. Although a predecessor of CERC held an interest in two oil and
gas leases on a portion of the property at issue, neither it nor any other CERC
entities drilled or conducted other oil and gas operations on those leases. In
January 2009, CERC and the plaintiffs reached agreement on the terms of a
settlement that, if ultimately approved by the Louisiana Department of Natural
Resources and the court, is expected to finally resolve this litigation. We and
CERC do not expect the outcome of this litigation to have a material adverse
impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either
us or CERC.

Other
Environmental.

From time to time we have received notices from
regulatory authorities or others regarding our status as a PRP in connection
with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of
environmental



contaminants.
In addition, we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation
related to such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be
predicted at this time, we do not expect, based on our experience to date, these
matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

We are a
holding company that conducts all of our business operations through
subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along with
any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in
Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated
with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries:

Risk
Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution
Business

CenterPoint
Houston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full value of

its true-up
components, which could result in the elimination of certain tax

benefits and
could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Houston’s results of

operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

In March
2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas Utility
Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as
allowed under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004, the
Texas Utility Commission issued its True-Up Order allowing CenterPoint Houston
to recover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included
interest through August 31, 2004, and provided for adjustment of the amount
to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, along with
the principal portion of additional EMCs returned to customers after
August 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district court
in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on the
various appeals. In its judgment, the district court:

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied recovery of a
      portion of the capacity auction true-up
amounts;

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston
      from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to
      REPs; and

•

affirmed
      the True-Up Order in all other
respects.

The
district court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately
$650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas Utility
Commission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initial
request.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas
Third Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In its
decision, the court of appeals:

•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity
      auction true-up amounts;



•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility
      Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to
      RRI;

•

ordered
      that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas
      Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility
      Commission; and

•

affirmed
      the district court’s judgment in all other
  respects.

In April
2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissued
substantially the same opinion as it had rendered in
December 2007.

In June
2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of the
court of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversal
of the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i) denied recovery of
EMCs paid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true-up
amounts allowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas Utility
Commission’s rulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 million
related to depreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s
refusal to permit CenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuation
methodology for determining the market value of its former generation assets.
Two other petitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by other
parties to the appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) the
Texas Utility Commission was without authority to fashion the methodology it
used for valuing the former generation assets after it had determined that
CenterPoint Houston could not use the partial stock valuation method,
(ii) in fashioning the method it used for valuing the former generating
assets, the Texas Utility Commission deprived parties of their due process
rights and an opportunity to be heard, (iii) the net book value of the
generating assets should have been adjusted downward due to the impact of a
purchase option that had been granted to RRI, (iv) CenterPoint Houston
should not have been permitted to recover construction work in progress balances
without proving those amounts in the manner required by law and (v) the
Texas Utility Commission was without authority to award interest on the capacity
auction true up award.

Review by
the Texas Supreme Court of the court of appeals decision is at the discretion of
the court. In November 2008, the Texas Supreme Court requested the parties
to the Petitions for Review to submit briefs on the merits of the
issues raised. Briefing at the Texas Supreme Court should be completed in the
second quarter of 2009. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not indicated
whether it will grant review of the lower court’s decision, its
request for full briefing on the merits allowed the parties to more fully
explain their positions. There is no prescribed time in which the Texas Supreme
Court must determine whether to grant review or, if review is granted, for a
decision by that court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe that
CenterPoint Houston’s true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes and
regulations and, accordingly, that it is reasonably possible that it will be
successful in its appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, we can provide no assurance
as to the ultimate court rulings on the issues to be considered in the appeal or
with respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the tax
normalization issue described below.

To
reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a net
after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to the
district court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been
recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court of
appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further review by
the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record an
additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of that
loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax
normalization issue described below and the calculation of interest on any
amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required
to refund beyond the amounts

recorded
based on the True-Up Order, but could range from $170 million to
$385 million (pre-tax) plus interest subsequent to December 31,
2008.

In the
True-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’s
stranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included in
the extraordinary loss discussed above, for the present value of certain
deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. We
believe that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed
regulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 that would have allowed utilities
owning assets that were deregulated before March 4, 2003 to make a
retroactive election to pass the benefits of ADITC and EDFIT back to customers.
However, the IRS subsequently withdrew those proposed normalization regulations
and in March 2008 adopted final regulations that would not permit utilities like
CenterPoint Houston to



pass the
tax benefits back to customers without creating normalization violations. In
addition, we received a PLR from the IRS in August 2007, prior to adoption of
the final regulations that confirmed that the Texas Utility Commission’s order
reducing CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by $146 million for
ADITC and EDFIT would cause normalization violations with respect to the ADITC
and EDFIT.

If the
Texas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversed
or otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation,
the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint Houston’s
unamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization violation is
deemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston the
ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits beginning in the taxable
year that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. Such
treatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse impact on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in addition to any
potential loss resulting from final resolution of the True-Up Order. In its
opinion, the court of appeals ordered that this issue be remanded to the Texas
Utility Commission, as that commission requested. No party, in the petitions for
review or briefs filed with the Texas Supreme Court, has challenged that order
by the court of appeals, though the Texas Supreme Court, if it grants review,
will have authority to consider all aspects of the rulings above, not just those
challenged specifically by the appellants. We and CenterPoint Houston will
continue to pursue a favorable resolution of this issue through the appellate or
administrative process. Although the Texas Utility Commission has not previously
required a company subject to its jurisdiction to take action that would result
in a normalization violation, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate
action the Texas Utility Commission may take on this issue on
remand.

CenterPoint
Houston must seek recovery of significant restoration costs arising from

Hurricane
Ike.

CenterPoint
Houston’s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of
Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast on September 13, 2008.
CenterPoint Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery
facilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of
$600 million to $650 million.

CenterPoint
Houston believes it is entitled to recover prudently incurred storm costs in
accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. The Texas
Legislature currently is considering  passage of legislation that
would (i) authorize the Texas Utility Commission to determine the amount of
storm restoration costs that CenterPoint Houston would be entitled to recover
and (ii) permit the Texas Utility Commission to issue a financing order
that would allow CenterPoint Houston to recover the amount of storm restoration
costs determined in such a proceeding through issuance of dedicated
securitization bonds, which would be repaid over time through a charge imposed
on REPs. In proceedings to determine and seek recovery of storm restoration
costs under the proposed legislation, CenterPoint Houston would be required to
prove to the Texas Utility Commission’s satisfaction its prudently incurred
costs as well as to demonstrate the cost benefit from using securitization to
recover those costs instead of alternative means. Alternatively, CenterPoint
Houston has the right to seek recovery of these costs under traditional rate
making principles. CenterPoint Houston’s failure to recover costs incurred as a
result of Hurricane Ike could adversely affect its liquidity, results of
operations and financial condition. For more information about CenterPoint
Houston’s recovery from Hurricane Ike, please read “Business — Electric
Transmission & Distribution — Hurricane Ike” in Item 1 of
this report.

CenterPoint
Houston’s receivables are concentrated in a small number of retail

electric
providers, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect

CenterPoint
Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of
operations.

CenterPoint
Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from
REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their
customers. As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston did business with
79 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served
by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability
of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to
delay such payments. In 2008, seven REPs selling power within CenterPoint
Houston’s service territory ceased to operate, and their customers were
transferred to the provider of last resort or to other REPs. CenterPoint Houston
depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory
provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a
REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations
significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can demand credit
protection from REPs for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of
last resort. However,



the Texas
Utility Commission is currently considering proposed revisions to those
regulations that, as currently proposed, would (i) increase the credit
protections that could be required from REPs, and (ii) allow utilities to defer
the loss of  payments for recovery in a future rate case. Whether such
revised regulations will ultimately be adopted and their terms cannot now be
determined. RRI, through its subsidiaries, is CenterPoint Houston’s largest
customer. Approximately 46% of CenterPoint Houston’s $141 million in billed
receivables from REPs at December 31, 2008 was owed by subsidiaries of RRI.
Any delay or default in payment by REPs such as RRI could adversely affect
CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
RRI’s unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRI were
unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options,
restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI’s subsidiaries might
seek to avoid honoring their obligations and claims might be made by creditors
involving payments CenterPoint Houston has received from RRI’s
subsidiaries.

Rate regulation
of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint

Houston’s ability
to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.

CenterPoint
Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility
Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a
test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not
match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are
determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of
CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable
return on its invested capital.

In this
regard, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement approved by the
Texas Utility Commission in September  2006, until June 30, 2010
CenterPoint Houston is limited in its ability to request retail rate relief. For
more information on the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please read
“Business — Regulation — State and Local Regulation — Electric
Transmission & Distribution — CenterPoint Houston Rate Agreement”
in Item 1 of this report.

Disruptions at
power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt

CenterPoint
Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.

CenterPoint
Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the
REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint
Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power
generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate,
CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be
diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows could be adversely affected.

CenterPoint
Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.

A
significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that
it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on
behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of
operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in
electricity usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer
months.

Risk Factors Affecting Our Natural
Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales

and Services, Interstate Pipelines
and Field Services Businesses

Rate regulation
of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a

reasonable return
and fully recover its costs.

CERC’s
rates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state
commissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis
of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that
CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The
regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates
that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a
reasonable return on its invested capital.



CERC’s businesses
must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in

CERC marketing
less natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field services

businesses must
compete directly with others in the transportation, storage,

gathering,
treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lower prices

and reduced
volumes, either of which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results

of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

CERC
competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other
fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas
distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales
to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting
interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be
able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas
directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of
natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may
have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

CERC’s
two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate
and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage
of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of
service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also compete
indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fuel
oils. The primary competitive factor is price. The actions of CERC’s competitors
could lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reduction
in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on
CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

CERC’s natural
gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services

businesses are
subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could

affect the
ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or

otherwise
adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations.

CERC is
subject to risk associated with increases in the price of natural gas. Increases
in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from
its customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for
uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into
CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices
could (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the
areas in which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales volumes and
revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail
or are unable to meet their obligations. Additionally, increasing natural gas
prices could create the need for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchase
natural gas.

A decline in
CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral

in order to
purchase gas.

If CERC’s
credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral in
order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant
cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing
significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely
affected.

The revenues and
results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and field

services
businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural
gas.

CERC’s
interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas
sourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of the
United States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions is
dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primary
factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is
natural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a
decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our
gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and
processing activities. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in
production from their existing wells. Other factors that impact production
decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available
production, producers’ access to needed capital and the cost of that capital,
the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental
permits, access to drilling rigs and regulatory changes. Because of these
factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our
assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in
production from



existing
reserves. To the extent the availability of this supply is substantially
reduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

CERC’s
revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas
and natural gas liquids (NGL). NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that
correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of
natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this
volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude
oil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of and
demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and
economic conditions and other factors.

CERC’s
revenues and results of operations are seasonal.

A
substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales and
transportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to
seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with
revenues being higher during the winter months.

The actual cost
of pipelines under construction and related compression facilities

may be
significantly higher than CERC had planned.

Subsidiaries
of CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline construction
projects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, be
involved in additional significant pipeline construction projects in the future.
The construction of new pipelines and related compression facilities requires
the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’s
estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule
or at all. The construction of new pipeline or compression facilities is subject
to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and
materials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays, weather delays,
inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the
construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of
approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not
approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions
on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding,
lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost.
As a result, there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to
achieve CERC’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect CERC’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The states in
which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either

through
legislation or rules, adopt restrictions similar to or broader than those

under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regarding organization,

financing and
affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on

CERC’s
ability to operate.

The
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which we and our subsidiaries
were subject prior to its repeal in the Energy Act, provided a comprehensive
regulatory structure governing the organization, capital structure, intracompany
relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding
companies and their member companies. Following repeal of that Act, some states
in which CERC does business have sought to expand their own regulatory
frameworks to give their regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and
scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in their states.
Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate

financing
activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the
utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility
businesses that can be conducted within the holding company structure.
Additionally they may impose record keeping, record access, employee training
and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in
the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s bond rating.

These
regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to operate
its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective
utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions over
similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing
regulatory requirements.



Risk
Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition

If we are unable
to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to

refinance
existing indebtedness could be limited.

As of
December 31, 2008, we had $10.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness on
a consolidated basis, which includes $2.6 billion of non-recourse
transition bonds. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $953 million
principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2011. This amount
excludes principal repayments of approximately $669 million on transition
bonds, for which a dedicated revenue stream exists. Our future financing
activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:

•

the
      resolution of the true-up components, including, in particular, the
      results of appeals to the courts regarding rulings obtained to
      date;

•

CenterPoint
      Houston’s recovery of costs arising from Hurricane
  Ike;

•

general
      economic and capital market
conditions;

•

credit
      availability from financial institutions and other
  lenders;

•

investor
      confidence in us and the markets in which we
  operate;

•

maintenance
      of acceptable credit ratings;

•

market
      expectations regarding our future earnings and cash
  flows;

•

market
      perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable
      terms;

•

our
      exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification obligations arising
      in connection with its separation from
  us; and

•

provisions
      of relevant tax and securities
laws.

As of
December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately
$2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds,
including approximately $527 million held in trust to secure pollution
control bonds for which we are obligated, $600 million securing borrowings
under a credit facility which was unutilized and approximately $229 million
held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is
obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately
$253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, including
approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution
control bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issue
additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property
additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $1.8 billion of
additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate
could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as
of December 31, 2008. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed
that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain
exceptions. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million
aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds in a public
offering.

Our
current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and
Subsidiaries — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Sources
and Uses of Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in
Item 7 of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for
any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not
recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal
of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our
ability to access capital on acceptable terms.



As a holding
company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions

from our
subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of
applicable

law or
contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those
distributions.

We derive
all our operating income from, and hold all our assets through, our
subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries
in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with
funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or
otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the
legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or
other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual
restrictions on their ability to make distributions.

Our right
to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our
creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to
the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In
addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor
would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary
and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.

The use of
derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of

business
could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results
of

operations and
those of our subsidiaries.

We and
our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and
forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We and
our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in
the market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail to perform.
In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from
external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve
management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the
underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the
reported fair value of these contracts.

Risks
Common to Our Businesses and Other Risks

We are subject to
operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from

environmental
laws and regulations.

Our
operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining
to health, safety and the environment as described in “Business
— Environmental Matters” in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. As an owner
or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and
processing systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we must
comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels.
These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in
many ways, such as:

•

restricting
      the way we can handle or dispose of
wastes;

•

limiting
      or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as
      wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered
      species;

•

requiring
      remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations,
      or attributable to former
operations; and

•

enjoining
      the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued
      pursuant to such environmental laws and
  regulations.

In order
to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and
devote other resources from time to time to:

•

construct
      or acquire new equipment;

•

acquire
      permits for facility operations;

•

modify
      or replace existing and proposed
  equipment; and



•

clean
      up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management
      facilities and other locations and
facilities.

Failure
to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of
administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the
assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the
issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes
impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and
restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise
released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the
environment.

Our insurance
coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and

increased
insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations,
financial

condition and
cash flows.

We
currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover
certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies
are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business
interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at
current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds
received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be
sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In common
with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions,
CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and
distribution system because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost
prohibitive. CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred
in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following Hurricane
Ike, or any such costs sustained in the future, through a change in its
regulated rates, and any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore,
CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of
its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We, CenterPoint
Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses

and assets that
we have transferred to others.

Under
some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities
associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer
own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy,
Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or
through subsidiaries and include:

•

merchant
      energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its
      subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI
      prior to its initial public offering in
  2001; and

•

Texas
      electric generating facilities transferred to Texas Genco Holdings, Inc.
      (Texas Genco) in 2004 and early
2005.

In
connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI, RRI and its
subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses
Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and

cause the
applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,
including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated
with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were
intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for
all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and
operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI were
unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which
Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in
connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be
responsible for satisfying the liability.

Prior to
the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had
guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading
subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies,
RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but
at the time of separation



in
September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure
CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed to provide
cash or letters of credit for CERC’s benefit, and undertook to use commercially
reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. In
December 2007, we, CERC and RRI amended that agreement and CERC released
the letters of credit it held as security. Under the revised agreement, RRI
agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure CERC against exposure
under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the revised agreement if and
to the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a risk of loss on
those guaranties.

The
potential exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demand
charges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demand
charges under these transportation contracts, which will be effective until
2018, was approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2008. RRI
continues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and on the basis of
market conditions, we and CERC have not required additional security. However,
if RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRI
should fail to provide adequate security in the event market conditions change
adversely, we would retain our exposure to the counterparty under the
guaranty.

RRI’s
unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRI were unable
to meet its obligations, it would need to consider, among various options,
restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor its
indemnification obligations and claims by RRI’s creditors might be made against
us as its former owner.

Reliant
Energy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of
energy sales in California and other markets and financial reporting matters.
Although these matters relate to the business and operations of RRI, claims
against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include the effect of
RRI’s financial results on Reliant Energy’s historical financial statements and
liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of RRI. We, CenterPoint
Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits
were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and
indemnification from RRI were determined to be unavailable or if RRI were unable
to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those
claims.

In
connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco, Texas Genco
assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant
Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the
applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,
including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the
transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were
obligations of CenterPoint Houston and CenterPoint Houston was not released by
third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended
generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its
subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical
businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those
liabilities arose. In connection with the sale of Texas Genco’s fossil
generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to NRG Texas LP
(previously named Texas Genco LLC), the separation agreement we entered
into with Texas Genco in connection with the organization and capitalization of
Texas Genco was amended to provide that all of Texas Genco’s rights and
obligations under the separation agreement relating to its fossil generation
assets, including Texas Genco’s obligation to indemnify us with respect to
liabilities associated with the fossil generation assets and related business,
were assigned to and assumed by NRG Texas LP. In addition, under the amended
separation agreement, Texas Genco is no longer liable for, and we have assumed
and agreed to indemnify NRG

Texas LP
against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its
organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are
covered by certain

insurance
policies or other similar agreements held by us. If Texas Genco or NRG Texas LP
were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified
against, and provided Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in
connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for
satisfying the liability.

We or our
subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in
lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to
asbestos. Most claimants in such litigation have been workers who participated
in construction of various industrial facilities, including power plants. Some
of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims
relate to facilities previously owned by us or our subsidiaries but currently
owned by NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that additional claims like those received
may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding
separation of the generating business from us and its sale to NRG Texas LP,
ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating
to



the
generating business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but we have agreed to
continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance
maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by NRG
Texas LP.

The global
financial crisis may have impacts on our business, liquidity and financial
condition

that we currently
cannot predict.

The
continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may
have an impact on our business, liquidity and our financial condition. Our
ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when
we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on
our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business
conditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity
financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions. With
respect to our existing debt arrangements, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which had
an approximately four percent participation in our credit facility and each of
the then-existing credit facilities of our subsidiaries, stopped funding its
commitments following the bankruptcy filing of its parent in September 2008 and
was subsequently terminated as a lender in our facility and the facility of
CenterPoint Houston. Defaults of other lenders should they occur could adversely
affect our liquidity. Capital market turmoil was also reflected in significant
reductions in equity market valuations in 2008, which significantly reduced the
value of assets of our pension plan. These reductions are expected to result in
increased non-cash pension expense in 2009, which will impact 2009 results of
operations.

In
addition to the credit and financial market issues, the national and local
recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways. These
include, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customer default
rates and wide swings in commodity prices.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and
analysis should be read in combination with our

consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 herein.

OVERVIEW

Background

We are a
public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
include:

•

CenterPoint
      Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the
      electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile
      area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston;
  and

•

CenterPoint
      Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries,
      CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six
      states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines
      and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly
      owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical
      natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and
      electric and gas utilities.

Business
Segments

In this
Management’s Discussion, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a
consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also
discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting
policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our
intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results
of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer
growth, economic conditions, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory
agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are
subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate
regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution
business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other
true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas
distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in
the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable
business segments as of December 31, 2008 is set forth below:

Electric
Transmission & Distribution

Our
electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission
and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving over
2 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf
Coast that has a population of approximately 5.6 million people and
includes Houston.

On behalf
of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to
substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in
locations throughout CenterPoint Houston’s certificated service territory. The
Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional
reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas.
ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned
electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power
marketers and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand
for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s largest power markets.
Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by
the Texas Utility Commission.

Natural
Gas Distribution

CERC owns
and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations),
which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation
for, approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial
customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and
Texas.



Competitive
Natural Gas Sales and Services

CERC’s
operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas
sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers
in the six states listed above as well as several other Midwestern and Eastern
states.

Interstate
Pipelines

CERC’s
interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles
of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois,
Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural
gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately
1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of
approximately 59 Bcf. It also owns a 10% interest in the Bistineau storage
facility located in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, with the remaining interest
owned and operated by Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP. Its storage capacity in
the Bistineau facility is 8 Bcf of working gas with 100 million cubic
feet per day of deliverability. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana
and Oklahoma.

Field
Services

CERC’s
field services business owns and operates approximately 3,600 miles of
gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process
natural gas from approximately 150 separate systems located in major producing
fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.

Other
Operations

Our other
operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used
in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of
our business operations.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

Significant
Events in 2008 and 2009

Hurricane
Ike

CenterPoint
Houston’s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of
Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast early Saturday,
September 13, 2008.

The
strong Category 2 storm initially left more than 90% of CenterPoint Houston’s
more than 2 million metered customers without power, the largest outage in
CenterPoint Houston’s 130-year history. Most of the widespread power outages
were due to power lines damaged by downed trees and debris blown by Hurricane
Ike’s winds. In addition, on Galveston Island and along the coastal areas of the
Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay, the storm surge and flooding from rains
accompanying the storm caused significant damage or destruction of houses and
businesses served by CenterPoint Houston.

CenterPoint
Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities
damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of $600 million
to $650 million. As is common with electric utilities serving coastal
regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole mounted equipment that
comprise CenterPoint Houston’s transmission and distribution system are not
covered by property insurance, but office buildings and warehouses and their
contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum
deductible of $10 million. Current estimates are that total losses to
property covered by this insurance were approximately
$17 million.

In
addition to storm restoration costs, CenterPoint Houston lost approximately
$17 million in revenue through December 31, 2008. Within the first 18
days after the storm, CenterPoint Houston had restored power to all customers
capable of receiving it.



CenterPoint
Houston has deferred the uninsured storm restoration costs as management
believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory
process. As a result, storm restoration costs did not affect our or CenterPoint
Houston’s reported net income for 2008. As of December 31, 2008,
CenterPoint Houston recorded an increase of $145 million in construction
work in progress and $435 million in regulatory assets for restoration
costs incurred through December 31, 2008. Approximately $73 million of
these costs are based on estimates and are included in accounts payable as of
December 31, 2008. Additional restoration costs will continue to be
incurred in 2009.

Assuming
necessary enabling legislation is enacted by the Texas Legislature in the
session that began in January 2009, CenterPoint Houston expects to seek a
financing order from the Texas Utility Commission to obtain recovery of its
storm restoration costs through the issuance of non-recourse securitization
bonds similar to the storm recovery bonds issued by another Texas utility
following the hurricanes that affected that utility’s service territories in
2005. Assuming those bonds are issued, CenterPoint Houston will recover the
amount of storm restoration costs determined by the Texas Utility Commission to
have been prudently incurred out of the bond proceeds, with the bonds being
repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. Alternatively, if
securitization is not available, recovery of those costs would be sought through
traditional regulatory mechanisms. Under its 2006 rate case settlement,
CenterPoint Houston is entitled to seek an adjustment to rates in this
situation, even though in most instances its rates are frozen until
2010.

Gas
Operations also suffered some damage to its system in Houston, Texas and in
other portions of its service territory across Texas and Louisiana. As of
December 31, 2008, Gas Operations has deferred approximately
$4 million of costs related to Hurricane Ike for recovery as part of future
natural gas distribution rate proceedings.

Debt
Financing Transactions

Pursuant
to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007,
in February 2008 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately
$488 million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of
4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates in February 2020 and February 2023,
respectively. Scheduled final payment dates are February 2017 and February 2020.
Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized
transition property of approximately $483 million representing the
remaining balance of the competition transition charge (CTC) adjusted to refund
certain unspent environmental retrofit costs and to recover the amount of the
fuel reconciliation settlement.

In April
2008, we purchased $175 million principal amount of pollution control bonds
issued on our behalf at 102% of their principal amount. Prior to the purchase,
$100 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of
7.75% and $75 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of
interest of 8%. Depending on market conditions, we may remarket both series of
bonds, at 100% of their principal amounts, in 2009.

In April
2008, we called our 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on
May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible
at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted
for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the
year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 16.9 million shares of our
common stock and paid cash of approximately $532 million to settle
conversions of approximately $535 million principal amount of our 3.75%
convertible senior notes.

In May
2008, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%. The proceeds from the sale of the
senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the
satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection with conversions of our
3.75% convertible senior notes as discussed above.

In May
2008, CERC Corp. issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior
notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.00%. The proceeds from the sale
of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including capital
expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in
affiliates.

In
November 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had expired in October
2008 with a new receivables facility that expires in November 2009. Availability
under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million,
reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances.



In
November 2008, CenterPoint Houston entered into a $600 million 364-day
credit facility. The credit facility will terminate if bonds are issued to
securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike and if those bonds
are issued prior to the November 24, 2009 expiration of the facility.
CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and regulatory approval for the
issuance of such bonds during 2009.

In
December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it
sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an
equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for
payments totaling $114 million. This transaction was accounted for as a
financing and, as of December 31, 2008, the consolidated financial
statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and a financing
obligation of $75 million related to this transaction.

In
January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal
amount of general mortgage bonds due in March 2014 with an interest rate of
7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate
purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving
credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration
costs associated with Hurricane Ike.

Equity
Financing Transactions

In 2008,
we received proceeds of approximately $65 million from the sale of
approximately 4.9 million common shares to our defined contribution plan
and proceeds of approximately $13 million from the sale of approximately
0.9 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend
reinvestment plan.

Interstate
Pipeline Expansion

The
Southeast Supply Header (SESH) pipeline project, a joint venture between
CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp.,
and Spectra Energy Corp., was placed into commercial service on September 6,
2008. This new 270-mile pipeline, which extends from the Perryville Hub,
near Perryville, Louisiana, to an interconnection with the Gulf Stream Natural
Gas System near Mobile, Alabama, has a maximum design capacity of approximately
one Bcf per day. The pipeline represents a new source of natural gas supply for
the Southeast United States and offers greater supply diversity to this region.
Our share of SESH’s net construction costs is approximately
$625 million.

Outlook

During
2008, economic conditions in the United States declined significantly, with
several large bank failures and consolidations, large declines in the values of
securities, disruptions in the capital markets, which made it difficult to raise
debt and equity, and increased costs for capital when it was available. Many of
the factors that led to the economic decline are continuing into 2009, but it is
impossible to predict the impacts such events may have in the future. Although
our businesses and the areas in which we serve have, to date, not been as
significantly affected as some others, in 2008, we experienced substantial
declines in the value of our pension plan assets as a result of the stock market
declines. Disruptions in the bank and capital markets during the last two
quarters of 2008 have led to higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty
regarding the ability to execute transactions in these markets.

Although
we cannot predict future performance, the decline in the value of our pension
plan assets that occurred during 2008 will result in increased non-cash
charges to pension plan expense in 2009, which will adversely impact earnings,
and may also result in the need for us to make significant cash contributions to
our pension plan subsequent to 2009. We also expect to experience higher
borrowing costs and greater uncertainty in executing capital markets
transactions if conditions in financial markets do not improve from their
current state.

To the
extent the adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers,
results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. The current low
commodity prices for natural gas and other energy products may cause energy
producers to scale back projects such as drilling new gas wells or constructing
new facilities. Reduced

demand
and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our
customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic
conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause
consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting
in less demand for our services.



These
factors may lead to reduced earnings during 2009, compared to 2008, if they
continue significantly into 2009 or if the magnitude of the economic downturn
increases beyond the impacts experienced in 2008.

Compared to 2007

Net Income.

We reported net
income of $447 million ($1.30 per diluted share) for 2008 compared to
$399 million ($1.17 per diluted share) for the same period in 2007.
The increase in net income of $48 million was primarily due to an
$88 million increase in operating income, a $37 million decrease in
interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, a
$35 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates
related primarily to SESH and a $17 million increase in the gain on our
indexed debt securities. These increases in net income were partially offset by
an $83 million increase in income tax expense, a $25 million increase
in the loss on our Time Warner investment and a $13 million increase in
interest expense on transition bonds.

Income Tax Expense.

Our 2008
effective tax rate of 38.4% differed from the 2007 effective tax rate of 32.8%
primarily as a result of revisions to the Texas State Franchise Tax Law (Texas
margin tax) which was reported as an operating expense prior to 2008 and is now
being reported as an income tax for CenterPoint Houston and a Texas state tax
examination in 2007.

Compared to 2006

Net Income.

We reported net
income of $399 million ($1.17 per diluted share) for 2007 compared to
$432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for the same period in 2006.
The decrease in net income of $33 million was primarily due to a
$208 million increase in the loss on our Time Warner investment, a
$133 million increase in income tax expense primarily as a result of the
favorable tax settlement reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2006
related to our 2.0% Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS)
and Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES) and a $33 million increase
in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due to
higher borrowing levels. These decreases in net income were partially offset by
a $191 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities, a
$140 million increase in operating income and a $10 million increase
in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.



Income Tax Expense.

In 2007,
our effective tax rate of 32.8% was lower than the expected statutory tax rate
as a result of the revised Texas margin tax and a Texas state tax examination
for tax years 2002 through 2004. Our 2007 effective tax rate differed from the
2006 effective tax rate of 12.6% primarily due to the favorable tax settlement
reached with the IRS in 2006 as discussed above.

2008 Compared to 2007.

Our
Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating
income of $545 million for 2008, consisting of $407 million from our
regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU),
exclusive of an additional $5 million from the competition transition
charge (CTC), and $133 million related to transition bond companies. For
2007, operating income totaled $561 million, consisting of
$400 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $42 million from
the CTC, and $119 million related

to
transition bond companies. Revenues for the TDU increased due to customer
growth, with over 30,000 metered customers added in 2008
($23 million), increased usage ($15 million) in part caused by
favorable weather experienced in 2008, increased transmission-related revenues
($21 million) and increased revenues from ancillary services
($5 million), partially offset by reduced revenues due to Hurricane Ike
($17 million) and the settlement of the final fuel reconciliation in 2007
($5 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to
higher transmission costs ($43 million), the settlement of the final fuel
reconciliation in 2007 ($13 million) and increased support services
($13 million), partially offset by a gain on sale of land ($9 million)
and normal operating and maintenance expenses that were postponed as a result of
Hurricane Ike restoration efforts ($10 million). Depreciation and
amortization increased $34 million primarily due to amounts related to the
CTC ($30 million), which were offset by similar amounts in revenues. Taxes
other than income taxes declined $21 million primarily as a result of the
Texas margin tax being classified as an income tax for financial reporting
purposes in 2008 ($19 million) and a refund of prior years’ state franchise
taxes ($5 million).

2007 Compared to 2006.

Our
Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating
income of $561 million for 2007, consisting of $400 million from the
TDU, exclusive of an additional $42 million from the CTC, and
$119 million related to transition bond companies. For 2006, operating
income totaled $576 million, consisting of $395 million from the TDU,
exclusive of an additional $55 million from the CTC, and $126 million
related to transition bond companies. Revenues increased due to growth
($22 million), with over 53,000 metered customers added in 2007, higher
transmission-related revenues ($22 million), increased miscellaneous
service charges ($15 million), increased demand ($7 million), interest
on settlement of the final fuel reconciliation ($4 million) and a one-time
charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the resolution of the unbundled
cost of service order ($32 million). These increases were partially offset
by the rate reduction resulting from the 2006 rate case settlement that was
implemented in October 2006 ($41 million) and lower CTC return resulting
from the reduction in the allowed interest rate on the unrecovered CTC balance
from 11.07% to 8.06% in 2006 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance
expense increased primarily due to higher transmission costs ($25 million),
the absence of a gain on the sale of property in 2006 ($13 million), and
increased expenses, primarily related to low income and energy efficiency
programs as required by the 2006 rate case settlement ($8 million),
partially offset by settlement of the final fuel reconciliation
($13 million).

2008 Compared to 2007.

Our
Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of
$215 million for 2008 compared to $218 million for 2007. Operating
income declined due to a combination of non-weather-related usage
($13 million), due in part to higher gas prices, higher customer-related
and support services costs ($9 million), higher bad debts and collection
costs ($4 million), increased costs of materials and supplies

($4 million),
and an increase in depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income
taxes ($3 million) resulting from increased investment in property, plant
and equipment. The adverse impacts on operating income were partially offset by
the net impact of rate increases ($11 million), lower labor and benefits
costs ($14 million), and customer growth from the addition of approximately
25,000 customers in 2008 ($6 million).

2007 Compared to 2006.

Our
Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of
$218 million for 2007 compared to $124 million for 2006. Operating
income improved as a result of increased usage primarily due to a return to more
normal weather in 2007 compared to the unusually mild weather in 2006
($33 million), growth from the addition of over 38,000 customers in 2007
($9 million), the effect of the 2006 purchased gas cost write-off
($21 million), the effect of rate changes ($7 million) and reduced
operation and maintenance expenses ($15 million). Operation and maintenance
expenses declined primarily as a result of costs associated with staff
reductions incurred in 2006 ($17 million) and settlement of certain rate
case-related items ($9 million), partially offset by increases in bad debts
and collection costs ($8 million) and other services
($5 million).

2008 Compared to 2007.

Our
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating
income of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
$75 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in
operating income of $13 million primarily resulted from lower gains on
sales of gas from previously written down inventory ($24 million) and
higher operation and maintenance costs ($6 million), which were partially
offset by improved margin as basis and summer/winter spreads increased
($12 million). In addition, 2008 included a gain from mark-to-market
accounting ($13 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the
lower of average cost or market ($30 million), compared to a charge to
income from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives
($10 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of
average cost or market ($11 million) for 2007. Our Competitive Natural Gas
Sales and Services business segment purchases and stores natural gas to meet
certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge
the economic value of the future sales.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Our
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating
income of $75 million for 2007 compared to $77 million for 2006. The
decrease in operating income of $2 million was primarily due to reduced
opportunities for optimization of pipeline and storage assets resulting from
lower locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials in the wholesale
business ($10 million) offset by an increase in sales to commercial and
industrial customers in the retail business ($3 million). In addition, 2007
included a charge



to income
from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives ($10 million)
and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market
($11 million), compared to a gain from mark-to-market accounting
($37 million) and an inventory write-down ($66 million) for
2006.

2008 Compared to 2007.

Our
Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of
$293 million for 2008 compared to $237 million for 2007. The increase
in operating income was primarily driven by increased margins (revenues less
natural gas costs) on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline that went into service
in May 2007 ($51 million), increased transportation and ancillary services
($27 million), and a gain on the sale of two storage development projects
($18 million). These increases are partially offset by higher operation and
maintenance expenses ($19 million), a write-down associated with pipeline
assets removed from service ($7 million), increased depreciation expense
($2 million), and higher taxes other than income taxes ($12 million),
largely due to tax refunds in 2007.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Our
Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of
$237 million for 2007 compared to $181 million for 2006. The increase
in operating income of $56 million was driven primarily by the new Carthage
to Perryville pipeline ($42 million), other transportation and ancillary
services ($20 million), lower spending in 2007 on project development costs
($6 million) and a decrease in other taxes ($8 million) related to the
settlement of certain state tax issues. These favorable variances to operating
income were partially offset by lower sales in 2007 of excess gas associated
with storage enhancement projects ($15 million) and increased operating
expenses ($6 million).

Equity Earnings.

In addition,
this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million and
$36 million (including $6 million and $33 million of
pre-operating allowance for funds used during construction) in the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, from its 50 percent interest
in SESH, a jointly-owned pipeline. These amounts are included in Equity in
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense)

2008 Compared to 2007.

Our
Field Services business segment reported operating income of $147 million
for 2008 compared to $99 million for 2007. The increase in operating income
of $48 million resulted from higher margins (revenue less natural gas
costs) from gas gathering, ancillary services and higher commodity prices
($34 million) and a one-time gain related to a settlement and contract
buyout of one of our customers ($11 million). Operating expenses increased
from 2007 to 2008 due to higher expenses associated with new assets and general
cost increases, partially offset by a gain related to the sale of
assets in 2008 ($7 million).

2007 Compared to 2006.

Our
Field Services business segment reported operating income of $99 million
for 2007 compared to $89 million for 2006. Continued increased demand for
gas gathering and ancillary services ($27 million) was partially offset by
lower commodity prices ($10 million) and increased operation and
maintenance expenses related to cost increases and expanded operations
($7 million).

Equity Earnings.

In addition,
this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million,
$10 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, from its 50 percent interest in a
jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Equity in

      activities




Cash
Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities in 2008 increased $77 million compared to
2007 primarily due to decreased tax payments/increased tax refunds
($289 million), increased net accounts receivable/payable
($190 million), increased fuel cost recovery ($138 million) and
increased pre-tax income ($131 million). These increases were partially
offset by increased net regulatory assets and liabilities ($447 million)
and increased net margin deposits ($247 million).

Net cash
provided by operating activities in 2007 decreased $217 million compared to
2006 primarily due to the timing of fuel recovery ($204 million), increased
tax payments ($10 million), increased interest payments ($40 million),
increased gas storage inventory ($36 million) and decreased net accounts
receivable/payable ($178 million). These decreases were partially offset by
decreased reductions in customer margin deposit requirements ($76 million)
and decreases in our margin deposit requirements
($145 million).

Cash
Used in Investing Activities

Net cash
used in investing activities increased $68 million in 2008 compared to 2007
due to increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $167 million,
primarily related to the SESH pipeline project, which was partially offset by
decreased capital expenditures of $94 million.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased $244 million in 2007 compared to
2006 due to increased capital expenditures of $107 million primarily
related to pipeline projects for our Interstate Pipelines business segment,
increased notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of $148 million
and increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $26 million,
primarily related to the SESH pipeline project.

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash
provided by financing activities in 2008 increased $27 million compared to
2007 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities
($779 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt
($188 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of
long-term debt ($825 million) and decreased short-term borrowings
($124 million).

Net cash
provided by financing activities in 2007 increased $410 million compared to
2006 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities
($334 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt
($576 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of
long-term debt ($319 million), increased dividend payments
($31 million) and decreased short-term borrowings
($142 million).

Future
Sources and Uses of Cash

Our
liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of
operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments,
working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such
regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2009 include
the following:



•

approximately
      $1.1 billion of capital
expenditures;

•

maturing
      long-term debt aggregating approximately $216 million, including
      $208 million of transition bonds;
and

•

dividend
      payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on
      debt.

We expect
that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2009. Cash
needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of
equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of
additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets
and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on
acceptable terms.

      calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for
      fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the
      applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term
      debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2008. We
      typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from
      operations and short-term
borrowings.

Material
      contributions to our qualified pension plan are not expected in 2009.
      However, we expect to contribute approximately $9 million and
      $18 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and
      postretirement benefits plans in
2009.

Represents
      estimated income tax liability for settled positions for tax years under
      examination. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the liability for
      uncertain income tax positions was $117 million. However, due to the
      high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash
      flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a
      reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these
      liabilities might be paid.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements.

Other than operating leases and the guaranties
described below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Prior to
the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had
guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading
subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies,
RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but
at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish
all obligations. To secure CERC against obligations under the remaining
guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for CERC’s benefit,
and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining
guaranties. In December 2007, we, CERC and RRI amended that agreement and
CERC released the letters of credit it held as security. Under the revised
agreement RRI agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure CERC
against exposure under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the new
agreement if and to the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a
risk of loss on those guaranties.

The
potential exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demand
charges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demand
charges under these transportation contracts, which will be effective until
2018, was approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2008. RRI
continues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and on the basis of
market conditions, we and CERC have not required additional security. However,
if RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRI
should fail to provide adequate security in the event market conditions change
adversely, we would retain our exposure to the counterparty under the
guaranty.

Debt Financing
Transactions.

Pursuant to a financing order issued by the
Texas Utility Commission in September 2007, in February 2008 a subsidiary of
CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $488 million in transition bonds
in two tranches with interest rates of 4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity
dates in February 2020 and February 2023, respectively. Scheduled final payment
dates are February 2017 and February 2020. Through issuance of the transition
bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized transition property of approximately
$483 million representing the remaining balance of the CTC, adjusted to
refund certain unspent environmental retrofit costs and to recover the amount of
the fuel reconciliation settlement.

In April
2008, we purchased $175 million principal amount of pollution control bonds
issued on our behalf at 102% of their principal amount. Prior to the purchase,
$100 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of
7.75% and $75 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of
interest of 8%. Depending on market conditions, we may remarket both series of
bonds, at 100% of their principal amounts, in 2009.

In April
2008, we called our 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on
May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible
at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted
for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the
year ended December 31,



2008, we
issued 16.9 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of
approximately $532 million to settle conversions of approximately
$535 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior
notes.

In May
2008, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%. The proceeds from the sale of the
senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the
satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection with conversions of our
3.75% convertible senior notes as discussed above.

In May
2008, CERC Corp. issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior
notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.00%. The proceeds from the sale
of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including capital
expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in
affiliates.

In
December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it
sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an
equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for
payments totaling $114 million. This transaction was accounted for as a
financing and, as of December 31, 2008, the consolidated financial
statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and a financing
obligation of $75 million related to this transaction.

In
January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million principal amount of
general mortgage bonds, due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The
proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes,
including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit
facility and from the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration
costs associated with Hurricane Ike.

Equity Financing
Transactions.

In 2008, we received proceeds of approximately
$65 million from the sale of approximately 4.9 million common shares
to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $13 million
from the sale of approximately 0.9 million common shares to participants in
our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan.

Credit and Receivables
Facilities.

In November 2008, CenterPoint Houston entered
into a $600 million 364-day credit facility. The credit facility will
terminate if bonds are issued to securitize the costs incurred as a result of
Hurricane Ike and if those bonds are issued prior to the November 24, 2009
expiration of the facility. CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and
regulatory approval for the issuance of such bonds during 2009.

The
364-day credit facility is secured by a pledge of $600 million of general
mortgage bonds issued by CenterPoint Houston. Borrowing costs for London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans will be at a margin of
2.25 percent above LIBOR rates, based on CenterPoint Houston’s current
ratings. In addition, CenterPoint Houston will pay lenders, based on current
ratings, a per annum commitment fee of 0.5 percent for their commitments
under the facility and a quarterly duration fee of 0.75 percent on the
average amount of outstanding borrowings during the quarter. The spread to LIBOR
and the commitment fee fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. The
facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition and other
securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant.

Our
$1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 55 basis
points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt
(excluding transition bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so
that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current
level for the remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that
the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the
earlier of December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston’s issuance of bonds to
securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the
permitted ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November
2008 modification.

CenterPoint
Houston’s $289 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45
basis points based on CenterPoint Houston’s current credit ratings. The facility
contains a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total
capitalization covenant.

CERC
Corp.’s $950 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45
basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current credit ratings. The facility contains
a debt to total capitalization covenant.



Under our
$1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million
credit facility and CERC Corp’s $950 million credit facility, an additional
utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50%
of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee
fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating.

Borrowings
under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions.
However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make
representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse
changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect.
Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon
the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp.
consider customary.

In
November 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had expired in October
2008 with a new receivables facility that expires in November 2009. Availability
under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million,
reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances.

We,
CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various
business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities
as disclosed above.

As of
February 13, 2009, we had the following facilities (in millions):

Our
$1.2 billion credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion CenterPoint
Energy commercial paper program under which we began issuing commercial paper in
June 2005. The $950 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a
$915 million commercial paper program under which CERC Corp. began issuing
commercial paper in February 2008. The CenterPoint Energy commercial paper is
rated “Not Prime” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), “A-2” by
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P), a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies, and “F3” by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). The CERC Corp.
commercial paper is rated “P-3” by Moody’s, “A-2” by S&P, and “F2” by Fitch.
As a result of the credit ratings on the two commercial paper programs, we do
not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our
short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or
the credit ratings set forth below in “— Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade
in Credit Ratings,” will remain in effect for any given period of time or that
one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy,
sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the
rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings
could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and
long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our
commercial strategies.

Securities Registered with the
SEC.

In October 2008, CenterPoint Energy and CenterPoint
Houston jointly registered indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint
Houston’s general mortgage bonds and CenterPoint

Energy’s senior
debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate
number of CenterPoint



Energy’s
shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase
contracts and equity units. In addition, CERC Corp. has a shelf registration
statement covering $500 million principal amount of senior debt
securities.

Temporary
Investments.

As of February 13, 2009, we had no external
temporary investments.

Money Pool.

We
have a money pool through which the holding company and participating
subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are
aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash
position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met
with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our
commercial paper.

Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade

A

      when the outlook was assigned or last
affirmed.

(2)

An
      S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term
      credit rating over the intermediate to longer
  term.

(3)

A
      “stable” outlook from Fitch encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to
      the likely ratings direction.

A decline
in these credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our
$1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston’s $289 million
credit facility and CERC Corp.’s $950 million credit facility. A decline in
credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be
issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to
complete capital market transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings
could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our Natural
Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business
segments.

In
September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of
$1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding. Each ZENS note
is exchangeable at the holder’s option at any time for an amount of cash equal
to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common
stock (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were
to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected
or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders
might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of
cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common
that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to
approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to
the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow
because tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares
become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise
retired and TW Common shares are sold. A tax obligation of approximately
$378 million would have been payable with respect to the ZENS for the
2008 tax year if all of the ZENS had been exchanged for cash on
December 31, 2008. The ultimate tax obligation related to the ZENS notes
continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and
there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of
the retirement of the ZENS notes.

The
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted on February 17, 2009,
allows us to elect to defer this tax obligation until 2014 and to recognize it
over the period from 2014 through 2018 for any ZENS retired in 2009 or
2010.

CenterPoint
Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating
in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides
comprehensive natural gas sales and



services
primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities
throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge
its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions
standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds.
Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the
amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the
extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular
time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide
collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is
routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2008, the amount posted
as collateral aggregated approximately $229 million. Should the credit
ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below
certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral on two
business days’ notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit.
We estimate that as of December 31, 2008, unsecured credit limits extended
to CES by counterparties aggregate $250 million; however, utilized credit
capacity is significantly lower. In addition, CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries
purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit
threshold of $100 million based on CERC Corp.’s S&P Senior Unsecured
Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will
increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly.

Pipeline
tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper
or the shipper’s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally
investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, cash or other collateral
may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months’
charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for
such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable
threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of
as much as $160 million, the amount depending on seasonal variations in
transportation levels.

Cross Defaults.

Under our
revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that
permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or
any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, four
outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $950 million in
principal amount as of February 13, 2009, provide that a payment default by us,
CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed
money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate
principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by
CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries’ debt
instruments or bank credit facilities.

Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures
and Joint Ventures

.  From time to time, we consider the acquisition
or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other
joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any
determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market
conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing,
size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments
are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with
proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not,
however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including,
among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general
economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions.

Other Factors that Could Affect Cash
Requirements.

In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital
resources could be affected by:

•

cash
      collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain
      contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging and gas storage
      activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas
      Sales and Services business segments, particularly given gas price levels
      and volatility;

•

acceleration
      of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain
      circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of
      natural gas suppliers;

•

increased
      costs related to the acquisition of natural
gas;

•

increases
      in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings
      under credit facilities;

•

various
      regulatory actions;



•

the
      ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the
      principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI’s
      indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the
      contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a
      guarantor;

•

slower
      customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher
      gas prices or changing economic
conditions;

•

the
      outcome of litigation brought by and against
us;

•

contributions
      to benefit plans;

•

restoration
      costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as
      hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs;
      and

•

various
      other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this
      report.

Certain Contractual Limits on Our
Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money.

CenterPoint Houston’s
credit facilities limit CenterPoint Houston’s debt (excluding transition bonds)
as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. CERC Corp.’s bank facility
and its receivables facility limit CERC’s debt as a percentage of its total
capitalization to 65%. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt,
excluding transition bonds, to EBITDA covenant. Such covenant was modified twice
in 2008 to provide additional debt capacity. The second modification was to
provide debt capacity for the financing of system restoration costs following
Hurricane Ike. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that
it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain
exceptions.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A
critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of
our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to
make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting
estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement
element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in
our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past
business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability.
The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made.
Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an
accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material
impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex
have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their
effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is
acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment
changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our
consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies
involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these
accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee
of the board of directors.

Accounting
for Rate Regulation

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, “Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), provides that
rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent
with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are
designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the
competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and
collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment,
our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate
Pipelines business segment apply SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses

and
revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected
in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities
and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service
rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and
liabilities are recorded when it is



probable,
as defined in SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (SFAS No. 5), that
these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining
probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and
includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in
regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and
the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If
events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and
liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down
these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, we had
recorded regulatory assets of $3.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of
$821 million.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

We review
the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable
intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such
carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as
required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” No
impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of
July 1, 2008. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market
conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and
intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates,
regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of
our assets and result in an impairment charge.

Fair
value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of
techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties,
present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of
earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be
different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

We
account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), and Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations — An Interpretation of SFAS No. 143”
(FIN 47). SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset
retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In the same period,
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize
regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the
recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and
FIN 47, and costs recovered through the ratemaking process.

We
estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the
discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following
components:

•

Inflation
      adjustment — The estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation
      estimates for labor, equipment, materials, and other disposal
      costs;

•

Discount
      rate — The estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were
      used as a proxy for the market risk
  premium; and

•

Third-party
      markup adjustments — Internal labor costs included in the cash flow
      calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in
      performing the tasks necessary to retire the
  asset.

Changes
in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the
ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under SFAS No. 143 and
FIN 47. For example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points,
this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by
approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis
points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same
percentage. At December 31, 2008, our estimated cost of retiring these
assets is approximately $63 million.

Unbilled
Energy Revenues

Revenues
related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally
recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries
to individual customers is based on the reading of their



meters,
which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of
each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are
estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled
electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply
volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends
and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated
purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates
in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are
determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating
results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting
estimates.

Pension
and Other Retirement Plans

We
sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all
employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and
other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the
expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions
about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future
compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In
addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal
and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from
actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower
withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These
differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense
recorded. Please read “— Other Significant Matters — Pension Plans”
for further discussion.

NEW
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See
Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new
accounting pronouncements that affect us.

OTHER
SIGNIFICANT MATTERS

Pension Plans.

As
discussed in Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements, we
maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are
based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the
maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.

Under the
terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate
the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an
amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under
ERISA.

We made
no contribution to the qualified pension plans in 2007 and 2008. The minimum
funding requirements for these plans did not require contributions for the
respective years.

Additionally,
we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows
participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled
under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits
on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified
plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified
benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and
totaled $9 million and $8 million in 2007 and 2008,
respectively.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” changes
in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension
expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years
over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such,
significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect
the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No.
158 requires us, as the sponsor of a plan, to (a) recognize on our balance
sheet as an asset a plan’s over-funded status or as a liability such plan’s
under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of
the



end of
our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans
in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive
income.

As a
result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, we
recorded a regulatory asset of $466 million and a charge to accumulated
comprehensive income of $79 million, net of tax.

At
December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market
value of plan assets of our pension plans by $434 million. Changes in
interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during
2009 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and
affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.

Pension
expense was $46 million, $15 million and $1 million for 2006,
2007 and 2008, respectively.

The
calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of
assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and
liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

As of
December 31, 2008, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was 0.50% lower than the rate
assumed as of December 31, 2007. We believe that our actual asset
allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the
estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation
and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate.

As of
December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming
a discount rate of 6.90%, which is a 0.50% increase from the 6.40% discount rate
assumed in 2007. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on
high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a
recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations
specific to the characteristics of our plan.

Pension
expense for 2009, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be
$112 million, of which we expect $89 million to impact pre-tax
earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate
of 6.90% as of December 31, 2008. If the expected return assumption were
lowered by 0.5% (from 8.00% to 7.50%), 2009 pension expense would increase by
approximately $6 million.

As of
December 31, 2008, the pension plan projected benefit obligation exceeded
plan assets (including the unfunded benefit restoration plan) by
$434 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 6.90% to
6.40%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation
and 2009 pension expense by approximately $74 million and $5 million,
respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated
Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of
December 31, 2008 by $59 million and would result in a charge to
comprehensive income in 2008 of $10 million, net of tax.

Future
changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors
related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and
liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will
be.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

Impact
of Changes in Interest Rates and Energy Commodity Prices

We are
exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered
into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated
financial statements. Most of the revenues and income from our business
activities are impacted by market risks. Categories of market risk include
exposure to commodity prices through non-trading activities, interest rates and
equity prices. A description of each market risk is set forth
below:

•

Commodity
      price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward
      prices and price volatilities of commodities, such as natural gas, natural
      gas liquids and other energy
commodities.



•

Interest
      rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of
      borrowings and changes in interest
rates.

•

Equity
      price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual
      equity securities.

Management
has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage
these market risks. We manage these risk exposures through the implementation of
our risk management policies and framework. We manage our commodity price risk
exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative
commodity instrument contracts. During the normal course of business, we review
our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate
based upon the circumstances of each situation.

Derivative
instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and options derive their
value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these
factors. These derivative instruments include negotiated contracts, which are
referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, and instruments that are listed and
traded on an exchange.

Derivative
transactions are entered into in our non-trading operations to manage and hedge
certain exposures, such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices. We believe
that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood
relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged.

Interest
Rate Risk

As of
December 31, 2008, we had outstanding long-term debt, bank loans, lease
obligations, and our obligations under our ZENS that subject us to the risk of
loss associated with movements in market interest rates.

Our
floating-rate obligations aggregated $563 million and $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. If the floating interest rates
were to increase by 10% from December 31, 2008 rates, our combined interest
expense would increase by approximately $3 million annually.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2008, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding
indexed debt securities) aggregating $9.2 billion and $9.0 billion,
respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of $9.7 billion
and $8.5 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate,
they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market
interest rates (please read Note 8 to our consolidated financial
statements). However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by
approximately $310 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from
their levels at December 31, 2008. In general, such an increase in fair
value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a
portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their
maturity.

As
discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, the ZENS
obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The
debt component of $117 million at December 31, 2008 was a fixed-rate
obligation and, therefore, did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due
to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt
component would increase by approximately $19 million if interest rates
were to decline by 10% from levels at December 31, 2008. Changes in the
fair value of the derivative component, a $133 million recorded liability
at December 31, 2008, are recorded in our Statements of Consolidated Income
and, therefore, we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative
component as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate. If
the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10% from December 31, 2008
levels, the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by
approximately $2 million, which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in
our Statements of Consolidated Income.

Equity
Market Value Risk

We are
exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of 21.6 million
shares of TW Common, which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our
obligations under the ZENS. Please read Note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of our ZENS obligation. A decrease of 10%
from the December 31, 2008 market value of TW Common would result in a net
loss of approximately $5 million, which would be recorded as an unrealized
loss in our Statements of Consolidated Income.



Commodity
Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities

We use
derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure
inherent in our businesses. The stand-alone commodity risk created by these
instruments, without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure
these instruments are intended to hedge, is described below. We measure the
commodity risk of our non-trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity
analysis. The sensitivity analysis performed on our non-trading energy
derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical
10% movement in energy prices. At December 31, 2008, the recorded fair
value of our non-trading energy derivatives was a net liability of
$183 million (before collateral). The net liability consisted of a net
liability of $224 million associated with price stabilization activities of
our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and a net asset of
$41 million related to our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
business segment. Net assets or liabilities related to the price stabilization
activities correspond directly with net over/under recovered gas cost
liabilities or assets on the balance sheet. A decrease of 10% in the market
prices of energy commodities from their December 31, 2008 levels would have
increased the fair value of our non-trading energy derivatives net liability by
$118 million with all of the increase attributable to price stabilization
activities related to our Natural Gas Distribution business segment. There would
be no consolidated income statement impact of the $118 million as the
Natural Gas Distribution segment records the offset to net over/under recovered
gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet.

The above
analysis of the non-trading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk
management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same
hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of
natural gas to which the hedges relate. Furthermore, the non-trading energy
derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction
portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, the adverse impact
to the fair value of the portfolio of non-trading energy derivatives held for
hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices
referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on
the underlying hedged physical transactions.

related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint
Energy, Inc.

Houston,
Texas

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of CenterPoint Energy,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated
February 25, 2009

expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.

MANAGEMENT’S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by
the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that:

•

Pertain
      to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
      fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
      company;

•

Provide
      reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
      preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
      are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
      directors of the company; and

•

Provide
      reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
      unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
      could have a material effect on the financial
  statements.

Management
has designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Management’s assessment included
review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness
of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 which is included herein on
page 60.

CENTERPOINT
ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)       Background

CenterPoint
Energy, Inc. (the Company) is a public utility holding company. The Company’s
operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution
facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, interstate pipelines and
natural gas gathering, processing and treating facilities. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company’s indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
included:

•

CenterPoint
      Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the
      electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile
      area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes
    Houston; and

•

CenterPoint
      Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries,
      CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six
      states. Subsidiaries of CERC own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas
      gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned
      subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural
      gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric
      and gas utilities.

For a
description of the Company’s reportable business segments, see
Note 14.

(2)       Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)         Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

(b)         Principles
of Consolidation

The
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions
and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method
of accounting for investments in entities in which the Company has an ownership
interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant influence. The Company’s
investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 50% ownership interest in
Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH) which owns and operates a 270-mile
interstate natural gas pipeline and a 50% interest in Waskom Gas Processing
Company, a Texas general partnership, which owns and operates a natural gas
processing plant. Other investments, excluding marketable securities, are
carried at cost.

(c)       Revenues

The
Company records revenue for electricity delivery and natural gas sales and
services under the accrual method and these revenues are recognized upon
delivery to customers. Electricity deliveries not billed by month-end are
accrued based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting
significant historical trends and experience. Natural gas sales not billed by
month-end are accrued based upon estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost
and unaccounted for gas and currently effective tariff rates. The Interstate
Pipelines and Field Services business segments record revenues as transportation
and processing services are provided.



(d)         Long-lived
Assets and Intangibles

The
Company records property, plant and equipment at historical cost. The Company
expenses repair and maintenance costs as incurred. Property, plant and equipment
include the following:

Goodwill

The
Company performs its goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluates
goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of these assets may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation for
goodwill is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair
value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the
reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting
unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount
of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to
determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the
second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets
and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible
assets) in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting
implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this
second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an
impairment charge is recorded for the difference.

The
Company performed the test at July 1, 2008, the Company’s annual impairment
testing date, and determined that no impairment charge for goodwill was
required.

The
Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including property, plant and
equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles, when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be
recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared
to the carrying value of the assets.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Company’s asset retirement obligations were
$81 million and $63 million, respectively. The decrease in asset
retirement obligations in 2008 of $18 million is primarily attributable to
the increase in the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to value the asset
retirement obligations as of the end of the period.



The
decrease in asset retirement obligations results in an increase in removal cost
regulatory liabilities as discussed in Note 2(e).

(e)       Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities

The
Company applies the accounting policies established in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), to the Electric Transmission &
Distribution business segment and the Natural Gas Distribution business segment
and to portions of the Interstate Pipelines business segment.

The
following is a list of regulatory assets/liabilities reflected on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2008:

(1)

As
      discussed in Note 8(b), the Company securitized approximately
      $483 million of electric generation-related regulatory assets in
      February 2008.

(2)

Pending
      review and approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas
      Utility Commission), the Company is not recording a return on its
      Hurricane Ike restoration costs, see Note 3(a). Other regulatory assets
      that are not earning a return were not material at December 31, 2007
      and 2008.

(3)

Upon
      adoption of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
      Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
      Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158), the Company
      recorded a regulatory asset for its unrecognized costs associated with
      operations that have historically recovered and currently recover pension
      and postretirement expenses in
rates.

The
Company’s rate-regulated businesses recognize removal costs as a component of
depreciation expense in accordance with regulatory treatment. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2008, these removal costs of $734 million and
$779 million, respectively, are classified as regulatory liabilities in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A portion of the amount of removal
costs that relate to asset retirement obligations have been reclassified from a
regulatory liability to an asset retirement liability in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
(FIN 47).

(f)       Depreciation
and Amortization Expense

Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method based on economic lives or a
regulatory-mandated recovery period. Amortization expense includes amortization
of regulatory assets and other intangibles. See Notes 2(e) and 3(a)
for additional discussion of these items.



The
following table presents depreciation and amortization expense for 2006, 2007
and 2008.

(g)         Capitalization
of Interest and Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

Allowance
for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the approximate net
composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity
funds used for construction. Although AFUDC increases both utility plant and
earnings, it is realized in cash when the assets are included in rates for
subsidiaries that apply SFAS No. 71. Interest and AFUDC for subsidiaries
that apply SFAS No. 71 are capitalized as a component of projects under
construction and will be amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives.
During 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company capitalized interest and AFUDC of
$10 million, $21 million and $12 million,
respectively.

(h)         Income
Taxes

The
Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and follows a policy of
comprehensive interperiod tax allocation. The Company uses the asset and
liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Investment tax credits that were
deferred are being amortized over the estimated lives of the related property. A
valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets for which
management believes realization is not considered more likely than
not.

Prior to
2007, the Company evaluated uncertain income tax positions and recorded a tax
liability for those positions that management believed were probable of an
unfavorable outcome and could be reasonably estimated. Effective January 1,
2007, the Company accounts for the tax effects of uncertain income tax positions
in accordance with FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). The
Company recognizes interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.
For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 9.

(i)       Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $38 million and
$35 million at December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The provision
for doubtful accounts in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Income for
2006, 2007 and 2008 was $35 million, $45 million and $54 million,
respectively.

On
November 25, 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had terminated
on October 28, 2008 with a new 364-day receivables facility. Availability
under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million,
reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. At December 31, 2007
and 2008, the facility size was $300 and $128 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2008, advances under the receivables facilities were
$232 million and $78 million, respectively.

(j)       Inventory

Inventory
consists principally of materials and supplies and natural gas. Materials and
supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Natural gas
inventories of the Company’s Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business
segment are also primarily valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Natural gas inventories of the Company’s Natural Gas Distribution business
segment are primarily valued at weighted average cost. During 2007 and 2008, the
Company recorded $11 million and $30 million, respectively, in
write-downs of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or
market.

(k)         Derivative
Instruments

The
Company utilizes derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts,
swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather
and interest rates on its operating results and cash flows. Such contracts are
recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value
unless the Company elects the normal purchase and sales exemption for qualified
physical transactions. A derivative contract may be designated as a normal
purchase or sale if the intent is to physically receive or deliver the product
for use or sale in the normal course of business. If derivative contracts are
designated as a cash flow hedge according to SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133), the effective
portions of the changes in their fair values are reflected initially as a
separate component of shareholders’ equity and subsequently recognized in income
at the same time the hedged items impact earnings. The ineffective portions of
changes in fair values of derivatives designated as hedges are immediately
recognized in income. Changes in other derivatives not designated as normal or
as a cash flow hedge are recognized in income as they occur. The Company does
not enter into or hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The
Company has a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate and business
segment officers that oversees all commodity price, weather and credit risk
activities, including the Company’s marketing, risk management services and
hedging activities. The committee’s duties are to establish the Company’s
commodity risk policies, allocate risk capital within limits established by the
Company’s board of directors, approve use of new products and commodities,
monitor positions and ensure compliance with the Company’s risk management
policies and procedures and limits established by the Company’s board of
directors.

The
Company’s policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments. A
leveraged financial instrument, for this purpose, is a transaction involving a
derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the
notional amount or volume of the instrument.

(l)       Investments
in Other Debt and Equity Securities

In
accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities” (SFAS No. 115), the Company reports
“available-for-sale” securities at estimated fair value within other long-term
assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and any unrealized gain or
loss, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and
accumulated other comprehensive income. In accordance with SFAS No. 115,
the Company reports “trading” securities at estimated fair value in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any unrealized holding gains and
losses are recorded as other income (expense) in the Company’s Statements of
Consolidated Income.

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Company held an investment in Time Warner
Inc. (TW) common stock (TW Common), which was classified as a “trading”
security. For information regarding this investment, see
Note 6.

(m)         Environmental
Costs

The
Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures, as appropriate,
depending on their future economic benefit. The Company expenses amounts that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not have
future economic benefit. The Company records undiscounted liabilities related to
these future costs when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities
are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.



(n)         Statements
of Consolidated Cash Flows

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to be
short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less
from the date of purchase. In connection with the issuance of transition bonds
in October 2001, December 2005 and February 2008, the Company was required
to establish restricted cash accounts to collateralize the bonds that were
issued in these financing transactions. These restricted cash accounts are not
available for withdrawal until the maturity of the bonds. Cash and cash
equivalents does not include restricted cash of $49 million and
$60 million at December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, which is
included in other current assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For additional information regarding transition bonds, see Notes 3(b) and
8(b). Cash and cash equivalents includes $128 million and $166 million
at December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, that is held by the Company’s
transition bond subsidiaries solely to support servicing the transition
bonds.

(o)         New
Accounting Pronouncements

In April
2007, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB
Interpretation No. 39” (FIN 39-1), which permits companies that enter into
master netting arrangements to offset cash collateral receivables or payables
with net derivative positions under certain circumstances. The Company adopted
FIN 39-1 effective January 1, 2008 and began netting cash collateral
receivables and payables and also its derivative assets and liabilities with the
same counterparty subject to master netting agreements.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”
(SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits the Company to choose,
at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the “fair
value option”). The Company would report unrealized gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent
reporting period. This accounting standard is effective as of the beginning of
the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007 but is not
required to be applied. The Company currently has no plans to apply SFAS No.
159.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007),

“

Business Combinations”
(SFAS No. 141R)

.

SFAS
No. 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations.
Under SFAS No. 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date
fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 141R also includes a substantial
number of new disclosure requirements and applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. As the
provisions of SFAS No. 141R are applied prospectively, the impact to the Company
cannot be determined until applicable transactions occur.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“

Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160).
SFAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
Company will adopt SFAS No. 160 as of January 1, 2009. The Company expects that
the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“

Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133” (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133) and requires
enhanced disclosures of derivative instruments and hedging activities such as
the fair value of derivative instruments and presentation of their gains or
losses in tabular format, as well as disclosures regarding credit risks and
strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. SFAS No. 161 is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15,
2008. The Company expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have a
material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.



In May
2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-1 “Accounting for
Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement),” which will change the accounting treatment
for convertible securities that the issuer may settle fully or partially in
cash. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, with retrospective application required. Under the final FSP, cash
settled convertible securities will be separated into their debt and equity
components. The value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair
value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt instrument without the
conversion feature, and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible
debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability will be recorded as additional
paid-in capital. As a result, the debt will be recorded at a discount reflecting
its below market coupon

interest
rate. The debt will subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected
life, with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being
reflected on the income statement. The Company currently has no convertible debt
that is within the scope of this FSP, but did during prior periods presented.
Accordingly, the implementation of the FSP will have a non-cash affect on net
income for prior periods and the consolidated balance sheets when the Company
had contingently convertible debt outstanding. The effect on net income for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 will be a decrease in net income of
$4 million and $1 million, respectively. Upon adoption of this FSP,
the effect on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 will be a credit to
Additional Paid-In-Capital of $23 million, with an offsetting debit to
retained earnings of $23 million.

(p)         Stock-Based
Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit Plans

Stock-Based
Incentive Compensation Plans

The
Company has long-term incentive compensation plans (LICPs) that provide for the
issuance of stock-based incentives, including performance-based shares,
performance-based units, restricted shares and stock options to officers and key
employees. A maximum of approximately 34 million shares of CenterPoint
Energy common stock is authorized to be issued under these plans.

Equity
awards are granted to employees without cost to the participants. The
performance shares are distributed based upon the achievement of certain
objectives over a three-year performance cycle. The stock awards granted in
2006, 2007 and 2008 are subject to the operational condition that total common
dividends declared during the three-year vesting period must be at least $1.80,
$2.04 and $2.19 per share, respectively. The stock awards vest at the end
of a three-year period. Upon vesting, both the performance shares and the stock
awards are issued to the participants along with the value of dividend
equivalents earned over the performance cycle or vesting period. The Company
issues new shares in order to satisfy share-based payments related to
LICPs.

Option
awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the
high and low sales price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. These
option awards generally become exercisable in one-third increments on each of
the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have 10-year
contractual terms. No options were granted during 2006, 2007 and
2008.

The
Company recorded LICP compensation expense of $10 million in each of the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008.

The total
income tax benefit recognized related to such arrangements was $4 million
in each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. No
compensation cost related to such arrangements was capitalized as a part of
inventory or fixed assets in 2006, 2007 or 2008.

Compensation
costs for performance shares and stock awards granted under the LICPs are
measured using fair value and expected achievement levels on the grant date.
Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and are adjusted as required
through the remaining vesting period.

As of
December 31, 2008 there was $22 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested LICP arrangements. That cost is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Cash
received from LICPs was $17 million, $22 million and $3 million
for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

The
actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions related to LICPs totaled
$11 million, $7 million and $5 million, for 2006, 2007 and 2008,
respectively.

Pension
and Postretirement Benefits

The
Company maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit plan covering
substantially all employees, with benefits determined using a cash balance
formula. Under the cash balance formula, participants accumulate a retirement
benefit based upon 5% of eligible earnings, which increased from 4% effective
January 1, 2009, and

accrued
interest. Prior to 1999, the pension plan accrued benefits based on years of
service, final average pay and covered compensation. Certain employees
participating in the plan as of December 31, 1998 automatically receive the
greater of the accrued benefit calculated under the prior plan formula through
2008 or the cash balance formula. Participants have historically been 100%
vested in their benefit after completing five years of service. Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company changed the vesting schedule to provide for 100%
vesting after three years to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In
addition to the non-contributory qualified defined benefit plan, the Company
maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow
participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled
under the Company’s non-contributory pension plan except for federally mandated
limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which
qualified plan benefits may be calculated.

The
Company provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired
employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Employees become
eligible for these benefits if they have met certain age and service
requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. Under plan amendments,
effective in early 1999, healthcare benefits for future retirees were changed to
limit employer contributions for medical coverage.

Such
benefit costs are accrued over the active service period of employees. The net
unrecognized transition obligation, resulting from the implementation of accrual
accounting, is being amortized over approximately 20 years.

On
January 5, 2006, the Company offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program
(VERP) to approximately 200 employees who were age 55 or older with at
least five years of service as of February 28, 2006. The election period
was from January 5, 2006 through February 28, 2006. For those electing
to accept the VERP, three years of age and service were added to their qualified
pension plan benefit and three years of service were added to their
postretirement benefit. The one-time additional pension and postretirement
expense of $9 million is reflected in the table below as a benefit
enhancement.

The
Company’s net periodic cost includes the following components relating to
pension, including the benefit restoration plan, and postretirement
benefits:

In
determining net periodic benefits cost, the Company uses fair value, as of the
beginning of the year, as its basis for determining expected return on plan
assets.

The
following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets, the
amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets and the key assumptions of the
Company’s pension, including benefit restoration, and postretirement plans. The
measurement dates for plan assets and obligations were December 31, 2007
and 2008.



At
December 31, 2008, the pension benefit obligation increased by $114 million due
to a plan amendment effective January 1, 2009.  The amendment increased
certain cash balance accounts in conjunction with a transition to a uniform cash
balance program effective 2009.

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was
$1,623 million and $1,708 million as of December 31, 2007 and
2008, respectively.

The
expected rate of return assumption was developed by reviewing the targeted asset
allocations and historical index performance of the applicable asset classes
over a 15-year period, adjusted for investment fees and diversification
effects.

The
discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that
receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and
the expected duration of obligations specific to the characteristics of the
Company’s plans.

For
measurement purposes, healthcare costs are assumed to increase 6.50% during
2009, after which this rate decreases until reaching the ultimate trend rate of
5.5% in 2011. Prescription drug costs are assumed to increase 12% during 2009,
after which this rate decreases until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 5.5%
in 2014.

Amounts
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of the

In
managing the investments associated with the benefit plans, the Company’s
objective is to preserve and enhance the value of plan assets while maintaining
an acceptable level of volatility. These objectives are expected to be achieved
through an investment strategy that manages liquidity requirements while
maintaining a long-term horizon in making investment decisions and efficient and
effective management of plan assets.

As part
of the investment strategy discussed above, the Company has adopted and
maintains the following weighted average allocation targets for its benefit

Savings
Plan

The
Company has a qualified employee savings plan that includes a cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), and an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) under
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Under the plan, participating employees may
contribute a portion of their compensation, on a pre-tax or after-tax basis,
generally up to a maximum of 50%, which increased from 16% in prior years, of
compensation. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company matches 100% of the first
6% of each employee’s compensation contributed. The Company previously matched
75% of the first 6% of each

employee’s
compensation contributed with the potential for an additional discretionary
match of up to 50% of the first 6% of each employee’s compensation contributed.
The matching contributions are fully vested at all times.

Participating
employees may elect to invest all or a portion of their contributions to the
plan in CenterPoint Energy common stock, to have dividends reinvested in
additional shares or to receive dividend payments in cash on any investment in
CenterPoint Energy common stock, and to transfer all or part of their investment
in CenterPoint Energy common stock to other investment options offered by the
plan.

The
savings plan has significant holdings of CenterPoint Energy common stock. As of
December 31, 2008, 21,352,777 shares of CenterPoint Energy’s common stock
were held by the savings plan, which represented 24.5% of its investments. Given
the concentration of the investments in CenterPoint Energy’s common stock, the
savings plan and its participants have market risk related to this
investment.

The
Company’s savings plan benefit expenses were $34 million, $35 million
and $39 million in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Postemployment
Benefits

Net
postemployment benefit costs for former or inactive employees, their
beneficiaries and covered dependents, after employment but before retirement
(primarily healthcare and life insurance benefits for participants in the
long-term disability plan) were $6 million in 2006. The Company recorded
postemployment benefit income of $2 million and $1 million in 2007 and
2008, respectively.

Included
in “Benefit Obligations” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2007 and 2008 was $37 million and $32 million,
respectively, relating to postemployment obligations.

Other
Non-Qualified Plans

The
Company has non-qualified deferred compensation plans that provide benefits
payable to directors, officers and certain key employees or their designated
beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon termination, retirement or death.
Benefit payments are made from the general assets of the Company. During 2006,
2007 and 2008, the Company recorded benefit expense relating to these plans of
$6 million, $7 million and $4 million, respectively. Included in
“Benefit Obligations” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2007 and 2008 was $100 million and $83 million,
respectively, relating to deferred compensation plans.



Change
in Control Agreements and Other Employee Matters

The
Company has agreements with certain of its officers that generally provide, to
the extent applicable, in the case of a change in control of the Company and
termination of employment, for severance benefits of up to three times annual
base salary plus bonus, and other benefits. These agreements are for a one-year
term with automatic renewal unless action is taken by the Company’s board of
directors prior to the renewal.

As of
December 31, 2008, approximately 30% of the Company’s employees are subject
to collective bargaining agreements. One of the collective bargaining agreements
covering approximately 5% of the Company’s employees, Gas Workers Union Local
No. 340, is scheduled to expire in 2009. The Company has a good relationship
with this bargaining unit and expects to negotiate a new agreement in
2009.

(3)       Regulatory
Matters

(a)

Hurricane Ike

CenterPoint
Houston’s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of
Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast in
September 2008.

The
strong Category 2 storm initially left more than 90% of CenterPoint Houston’s
more than 2 million metered customers without power, the largest outage in
CenterPoint Houston’s 130-year history. Most of the widespread

power
outages were due to power lines damaged by downed trees and debris blown by
Hurricane Ike’s winds. In addition, on Galveston Island and along the coastal
areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay, the storm surge and flooding from
rains accompanying the storm caused significant damage or destruction of houses
and businesses served by CenterPoint Houston.

CenterPoint
Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities
damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of $600 million
to $650 million. As is common with electric utilities serving coastal
regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole mounted equipment that
comprise CenterPoint Houston’s transmission and distribution system are not
covered by property insurance, but office buildings and warehouses and their
contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum
deductible of $10 million. Current estimates are that total losses to
property covered by this insurance were approximately
$17 million.

CenterPoint
Houston has deferred the uninsured storm restoration costs as management
believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory
process. As a result, storm restoration costs did not affect the Company’s or
CenterPoint Houston’s reported net income for 2008. As of December 31,
2008, CenterPoint Houston recorded an increase of $145 million in
construction work in progress and $435 million in regulatory assets for
restoration costs incurred through December 31, 2008. Approximately
$73 million of these costs are based on estimates and are included in
accounts payable as of December 31, 2008. Additional restoration costs will
continue to be incurred in 2009.

Assuming
necessary enabling legislation is enacted by the Texas Legislature in the
session that began in January 2009, CenterPoint Houston expects to seek a
financing order from the Texas Utility Commission to obtain recovery of its
storm restoration costs through the issuance of non-recourse securitization
bonds similar to the storm recovery bonds issued by another Texas utility
following the hurricanes that affected that utility’s service territories in
2005. Assuming those bonds are issued, CenterPoint Houston will recover the
amount of storm restoration costs determined by the Texas Utility Commission to
have been prudently incurred out of the bond proceeds, with the bonds being
repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. Alternatively, if
securitization is not available, recovery of those costs would be sought through
traditional regulatory mechanisms. Under its 2006 rate case settlement,
CenterPoint Houston is entitled to seek an adjustment to rates in this
situation, even though in most instances its rates are frozen until
2010.

The
natural gas distribution business of CERC (Gas Operations) also suffered some
damage to its system in Houston, Texas and in other portions of its service
territory across Texas and Louisiana. As of December 31, 2008,



Gas
Operations has deferred approximately $4 million of costs related to
Hurricane Ike for recovery as part of future natural gas distribution rate
proceedings.

(b)         Recovery
of True-Up Balance

In March
2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas Utility
Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as
allowed under the Texas Electric Choice Plan (Texas electric restructuring law).
In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order
(True-Up Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance of
approximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31,
2004, and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include
interest on the balance until recovery, along with the principal portion of
additional excess mitigation credits (EMCs) returned to customers after
August 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district court
in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on the
various appeals. In its judgment, the district court:

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied recovery of a
      portion of the capacity auction true-up
amounts;

•

reversed
      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston
      from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to retail electric
      providers (REPs); and

•

affirmed
      the True-Up Order in all other
respects.

The
district court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately
$650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas Utility
Commission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initial
request.

CenterPoint
Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas
Third Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In
its decision, the court of appeals:

•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity
      auction true-up amounts;

•

reversed
      the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility
      Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to
      Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI);

•

ordered
      that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas
      Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility Commission;
      and

•

affirmed
      the district court’s judgment in all other
  respects.

In April
2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissued
substantially the same opinion as it had rendered in
December 2007.

In June
2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of the
court of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversal
of the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i) denied recovery of EMCs
paid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true up amounts
allowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s
rulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 million related to
depreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s refusal to permit
CenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuation methodology for
determining the market value of its former generation assets. Two other
petitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by other parties to
the appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) the Texas Utility
Commission was without authority to fashion the methodology it used for valuing
the former generation assets after it had determined that CenterPoint Houston
could not use the partial stock valuation method, (ii) in fashioning the method
it used for valuing the former generating assets, the Texas Utility Commission
deprived parties of their due process rights and an opportunity to be heard,
(iii) the net book value of the generating assets should have been adjusted
downward due to the impact of a purchase option that had been granted to RRI,
(iv) CenterPoint Houston should not have been permitted to recover



construction
work in progress balances without proving those amounts in the manner required
by law and (v) the Texas Utility Commission was without authority to award
interest on the capacity auction true up award.

Review by
the Texas Supreme Court of the court of appeals decision is at the discretion of
the court. In November 2008, the Texas Supreme Court requested the parties
to the Petitions for Review to submit briefs on the merits of the
issues raised. Briefing at the Texas Supreme Court should be completed in the
second quarter of 2009. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not indicated
whether it will grant review of the lower court’s decision, its
request for full briefing on the merits allowed the parties to more fully
explain their positions. There is no prescribed time in which the Texas Supreme
Court must determine whether to grant review or, if review is granted, for a
decision by that court. Although the Company and CenterPoint Houston believe
that CenterPoint Houston’s true-up request is consistent with applicable
statutes and regulations and, accordingly, that it is reasonably possible that
it will be successful in its appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, the Company can
provide no assurance as to the ultimate court rulings on the issues to be
considered in the appeal or with respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas
Utility Commission on the tax normalization issue described below.

To
reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, the Company recorded
a net after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to
the district court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been
recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, if the
court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further
review by the Texas Supreme Court, the Company anticipates that it would be
required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision.
The amount of that loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate
resolution of the tax normalization issue described below and the

calculation
of interest on any amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to
recover or is required to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the
True-up Order, but could range from $170 million to $385 million
(pre-tax) plus interest subsequent to December 31, 2008.

In the
True-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’s
stranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included in
the extraordinary loss discussed above, for the present value of certain
deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. The
Company believes that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed
regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in March 2003 that
would have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated before
March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass the benefits of
Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal
Income Taxes (EDFIT) back to customers. However, the IRS subsequently withdrew
those proposed normalization regulations and in March 2008 adopted final
regulations that would not permit utilities like CenterPoint Houston to pass the
tax benefits back to customers without creating normalization violations. In
addition, the Company received a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS in
August 2007, prior to adoption of the final regulations that confirmed that the
Texas Utility Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost
recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT would cause normalization
violations with respect to the ADITC and EDFIT.

If the
Texas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversed
or otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation,
the IRS could require the Company to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint
Houston’s unamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization
violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny
CenterPoint Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits
beginning in the taxable year that the normalization violation is deemed to have
occurred. Such treatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse
impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows in addition to any potential loss resulting from final resolution of the
True-Up Order. In its opinion, the court of appeals ordered that this issue be
remanded to the Texas Utility Commission, as that commission requested. No
party, in the petitions for review or briefs filed with the Texas Supreme Court,
has challenged that order by the court of appeals, though the Texas Supreme
Court, if it grants review, will have authority to consider all aspects of the
rulings above, not just those challenged specifically by the appellants. The
Company and CenterPoint Houston will continue to pursue a favorable resolution
of this issue through the appellate or administrative process. Although the
Texas Utility Commission has not previously required a company subject to its
jurisdiction to take action that would result in a normalization violation, no
prediction can be made as to the ultimate action the Texas Utility Commission
may take on this issue on remand.



The Texas
electric restructuring law allowed the amounts awarded to CenterPoint Houston in
the Texas Utility Commission’s True-Up Order to be recovered either through
securitization or through implementation of a competition transition charge
(CTC) or both. Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility
Commission in March 2005 and affirmed by a Travis County district court, in
December 2005 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued $1.85 billion
in transition bonds with interest rates ranging from 4.84% to 5.30% and final
maturity dates ranging from February 2011 to August 2020. Through issuance of
the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered approximately
$1.7 billion of the true-up balance determined in the True-Up Order plus
interest through the date on which the bonds were issued.

In July
2005, CenterPoint Houston received an order from the Texas Utility Commission
allowing it to implement a CTC designed to collect the remaining
$596 million from the True-Up Order over 14 years plus interest at an
annual rate of 11.075% (CTC Order). The CTC Order authorized CenterPoint Houston
to impose a charge on REPs to recover the portion of the true-up balance not
recovered through a financing order. The CTC Order also allowed CenterPoint
Houston to collect approximately $24 million of rate case expenses over
three years without a return through a separate tariff rider (Rider RCE).
CenterPoint Houston implemented the CTC and Rider RCE effective
September 13, 2005 and began recovering approximately $620 million.
The return on the CTC portion of the true-up balance was included in CenterPoint
Houston’s tariff-based revenues beginning September 13, 2005. Effective
August 1, 2006, the interest rate on the unrecovered balance of the CTC was
reduced from 11.075% to 8.06% pursuant to a revised rule adopted by the Texas
Utility Commission in June 2006. Recovery of rate case expenses under Rider RCE
was completed in September 2008.

Certain
parties appealed the CTC Order to a district court in Travis County. In May
2006, the district court issued a judgment reversing the CTC Order in three
respects. First, the court ruled that the Texas Utility Commission had
improperly relied on provisions of its rule dealing with the interest rate
applicable to CTC amounts. The district court reached that conclusion based on
its belief that the Texas Supreme Court had previously invalidated that entire
section of the rule. The 11.075% interest rate in question was applicable from
the implementation of the CTC Order on September 13, 2005 until
August 1, 2006, the effective date of the implementation of a new CTC in
compliance with the revised rule discussed above. Second, the district court
reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that allows CenterPoint Houston
to recover through the Rider RCE the costs (approximately $5 million) for a
panel appointed by the Texas Utility Commission in connection with the valuation
of electric generation assets. Finally, the district court accepted the
contention of one party that the CTC should not be allocated to retail customers
that have switched to new on-site generation. The Texas Utility Commission and
CenterPoint Houston appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas
Third Court of Appeals, and in July 2008, the court of appeals reversed the
district court’s judgment in all respects and affirmed the Texas Utility
Commission’s order. Two of the appellants have requested further review from the
Texas Supreme Court. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted at
this time. However, the Company does not expect the disposition of this matter
to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s or CenterPoint Houston’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

During
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, CenterPoint Houston
recognized approximately $55 million, $42 million and $5 million,
respectively, in operating income from the CTC. Additionally, during the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, CenterPoint Houston recognized
approximately $13 million, $14 million and $13 million,
respectively, of the allowed equity return not previously recognized. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had not recognized an allowed equity return
of $207 million on CenterPoint Houston’s true-up balance because such
return will be recognized as it is recovered in rates.

During
the 2007 legislative session, the Texas legislature amended statutes prescribing
the types of true-up balances that can be securitized by utilities and
authorized the issuance of transition bonds to recover the balance of the CTC.
In June 2007, CenterPoint Houston filed a request with the Texas Utility
Commission for a financing order that would allow the securitization of the
remaining balance of the CTC, adjusted to refund certain unspent environmental
retrofit costs and to recover the amount of the final fuel reconciliation
settlement. CenterPoint Houston reached substantial agreement with other parties
to this proceeding, and a financing order was approved by the Texas Utility
Commission in September 2007. In February 2008, pursuant to the financing order,
a new special purpose subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately
$488 million of transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of
4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates of February 2020 and February 2023,
respectively. Contemporaneously with the issuance of those bonds, the CTC was
terminated and a transition charge was implemented.



(c)       Rate
Proceedings

Texas.

In March
2008, Gas Operations filed a request to change its rates with the Railroad
Commission of Texas (Railroad Commission) and the 47 cities in its Texas Coast
service territory, an area consisting of approximately 230,000 customers in
cities and communities on the outskirts of Houston. The request sought to
establish uniform rates, charges and terms and conditions of service for the
cities and environs of the Texas Coast service territory. Of the 47 cities, 23
either affirmatively approved or allowed the filed rates to go into effect by
operation of law. Nine other cities were represented by the Texas Coast
Utilities Coalition (TCUC) and 15 cities were represented by the Gulf Coast
Coalition of Cities (GCCC). In July 2008, Gas Operations reached a settlement
agreement with the GCCC. That settlement agreement, if implemented across the
entire Texas Coast service territory, would allow Gas Operations a
$3.4 million annual increase in revenues. The TCUC cities denied the rate
change request and Gas Operations appealed the denial of rates to the Railroad
Commission. The Railroad Commission issued an order in October 2008, which, if
implemented across the entire Texas Coast service territory, would result in an
annual revenue increase of $3.7 million. Both the Railroad Commission order
and the settlement provide for an annual rate adjustment mechanism to reflect
changes in operating expenses and revenues as well as changes in capital
investment and associated changes in revenue-related taxes. In
December 2008, the Railroad Commission issued an order on rehearing.
Parties have filed second motions for rehearing on this order. However, in
December 2008, Gas Operations implemented the approved rates for the nine
TCUC cities and the environs, subject to refund. The impact of the Railroad
Commission’s order on rehearing on the settled rates is still under review, and
how rates will be

conformed
among all cities in the Texas Coast service territory is unknown at this time. A
final decision from the Railroad Commission regarding the second motions for
rehearing is expected no later than March 2009.

In
September 2008, CenterPoint Houston filed an application with the Texas Utility
Commission requesting an interim update to its wholesale transmission rate. The
filing resulted in a revenue requirement increase of $22.5 million over
rates then in effect. Approximately 74% will be paid by distribution companies
other than CenterPoint Houston. The remaining 26% represents CenterPoint
Houston’s share. That amount cannot be included in rates until 2010 under the
terms of the rate freeze implemented in the settlement of CenterPoint Houston’s
2006 rate proceeding. In November 2008, the Texas Utility Commission approved
CenterPoint Houston’s request. The interim rates became effective for service on
and after November 5, 2008.

Minnesota.

In
November 2006, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) denied a request
filed by Gas Operations for a waiver of MPUC rules in order to allow Gas
Operations to recover approximately $21 million in unrecovered purchased
gas costs related to periods prior to July 1, 2004. Those unrecovered gas
costs were identified as a result of revisions to previously approved
calculations of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Following that denial, Gas
Operations recorded a $21 million adjustment to reduce pre-tax earnings in
the fourth quarter of 2006 and reduced the regulatory asset related to these
costs by an equal amount. In March 2007, following the MPUC’s denial of
reconsideration of its ruling, Gas Operations petitioned the Minnesota Court of
Appeals for review of the MPUC’s decision, and in May 2008 that court ruled that
the MPUC had been arbitrary and capricious in denying Gas Operations a waiver.
The court ordered the case remanded to the MPUC for reconsideration under the
same principles the MPUC had applied in previously granted waiver requests. The
MPUC sought further review of the court of appeals decision from the Minnesota
Supreme Court, and in July 2008, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to review
the decision. In January 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court heard oral arguments.
While there is no deadline for a decision, a decision is expected by the end of
the third quarter of 2009. While no prediction can be made as to the ultimate
outcome, this matter will have no negative impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
November 2008, Gas Operations filed a request with the MPUC to increase its
rates for utility distribution service. If approved by the MPUC, the proposed
new rates would result in an overall increase in annual revenue of
$59.8 million. The proposed increase would allow Gas Operations to recover
increased operating costs, including higher bad debt and collection expenses,
the cost of improved customer service and inflationary increases in other
expenses. It also would allow recovery of increased costs related to
conservation improvement programs and provide a return for the additional
capital invested to serve its customers. In addition, Gas Operations is seeking
an adjustment mechanism that would annually adjust rates to reflect changes in
use per customer. In December 2008, the MPUC accepted the case and approved
an interim rate increase of $51.2 million, which became effective on
January 2, 2009, subject to refund. The MPUC is allowed ten months to issue a
final decision; however, an extension of time can occur in certain
circumstances.



(4)       Derivative
Instruments

The
Company is exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions
entered into in the normal course of business. The Company utilizes derivative
instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate
the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on its
operating results and cash flows.

(a)         Non-Trading
Activities

Cash Flow
Hedges.

The Company has entered into certain derivative
instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. The
objective of these derivative instruments is to hedge the price risk associated
with natural gas purchases and sales to reduce cash flow variability related to
meeting the Company’s wholesale and retail customer obligations. During the year
ended December 31, 2006, hedge ineffectiveness resulted in a gain of
$2 million and during both the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008,
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in a loss of less than $1 million from
derivatives that qualify for and are designated as cash flow hedges. No
component of the derivative instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness. If it becomes probable that an anticipated
transaction being hedged will not occur, the Company realizes in net income the
deferred gains and losses previously recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. When an anticipated transaction being

hedged
affects earnings, the accumulated deferred gain or loss recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified and included in the
Statements of Consolidated Income under the “Expenses” caption “Natural gas.”
Cash flows resulting from these transactions in non-trading energy derivatives
are included in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in the same category
as the item being hedged. As of December 31, 2008, the Company expects less
than $1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income to be
reclassified as a decrease in Natural gas expense during the next twelve
months.

The
length of time the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future
cash flows using derivative instruments that have been designated and have
qualified as cash flow hedging instruments is less than one year. The Company’s
policy is not to exceed ten years in hedging its exposure.

Other Derivative
Instruments.

The Company enters into certain derivative
instruments to manage physical commodity price risks that do not qualify or are
not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133. The
Company utilizes these financial instruments to manage physical commodity price
risks and does not engage in proprietary or speculative commodity trading.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company decreased natural gas
expense from unrealized net gains of $34 million. During the year ended
December 31, 2007, the Company increased natural gas expense from
unrealized net losses of $10 million. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company increased revenues from unrealized net gains
of $101 million and increased natural gas expense from unrealized net
losses of $88 million, a net unrealized gain of
$13 million.

Weather
Derivatives.

The Company has weather normalization or other
rate mechanisms that mitigate the impact of weather in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and a portion of Texas. The remaining Gas Operations jurisdictions,
Minnesota, Mississippi and most of Texas, do not have such mechanisms. As a
result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a significant positive or
negative effect on the results of these operations.

In 2007,
the Company entered into heating-degree day swaps to mitigate the effect of
fluctuations from normal weather on its financial position and cash flows for
the 2007-2008 winter heating season. The swaps were based on ten-year normal
weather and provided for a maximum payment by either party of $18 million.
In July 2008, the Company entered into heating-degree day swaps to mitigate the
effect of fluctuations from normal weather on its financial position and cash
flows for the 2008-2009 winter heating season. The swaps are based on ten-year
normal weather and provide for a maximum payment by either party of
$11 million. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, the
Company recognized losses of $-0- and $17 million, respectively, related to
these swaps. Such amounts were substantially offset by increased margin due to
colder than normal weather. These weather derivative losses are included in
revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

Interest Rate
Swaps.

During 2002, the Company settled forward-starting
interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of $1.5 billion at
a cost of $156 million, which was recorded in other comprehensive loss and
was amortized into interest expense over the five-year life of the designated
fixed-rate debt. The settlement amount was



fully
amortized at December 31, 2007. Amortization of amounts deferred in
accumulated other comprehensive loss for 2006 and 2007 was $31 million and
$20 million, respectively.

Hedging of Future Debt
Issuances.

In December 2007 and January 2008, the Company
entered into treasury rate lock derivative instruments (treasury rate locks)
having an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and a weighted-average
locked U.S. treasury rate on ten-year debt of 4.05%. These treasury rate locks
were executed to hedge the ten-year U.S. treasury rate expected to be used in
pricing $300 million of fixed-rate debt the Company planned to issue in
2008, because changes in the U.S treasury rate would cause variability in the
Company’s forecasted interest payments. These treasury rate lock derivatives
were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses
associated with the treasury rate lock derivative instruments were recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In May 2008, the Company
settled its treasury rate locks for a payment of $7 million. The
$7 million loss recognized upon settlement of the treasury rate locks was
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be
recognized as a component of interest expense over the ten-year life of the
related $300 million senior notes issued in May 2008. Amortization of
amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended
December 31, 2008 was less than $1 million. During the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Company recognized a loss of
$2 million and $5 million, respectively, for these treasury rate locks
in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Ineffectiveness for the treasury rate
locks was not material during the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2008.

(b)         Credit
Risks

In
addition to the risk associated with price movements, credit risk is also
inherent in the Company’s non-trading derivative activities. Credit risk relates
to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance of contractual obligations by
a counterparty. The following table shows the composition of the non-trading
derivative assets of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2008 (in
millions):

“Investment

      along with the consideration of credit support (such as parent company
      guaranties) and collateral, which encompass cash and standby letters of
      credit. For unrated counterparties, the Company performs financial
      statement analysis, considering contractual rights and restrictions and
      collateral, to create a synthetic credit
rating.

Retail
      end users represent commercial and industrial customers who have
      contracted to fix the price of a portion of their physical gas
      requirements for future periods.

(5)       Fair
Value Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
(SFAS No. 157), which requires additional disclosures about the Company’s
financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 157-2 delays the effective date for SFAS No. 157 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, to
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
November 15, 2008. The Company has elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157
for its goodwill impairment test and the measurement of asset retirement
obligations until January 1, 2009 as permitted. Beginning in January 2008,
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used
to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined in SFAS No. 157 and
directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to
fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:



Level 1:
Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair
value generally are financial derivatives, investments and equity securities
listed in active markets.

Level 2:
Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Fair value assets and
liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with
fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets.

Level 3:
Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of
the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset. Generally, assets and
liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are financial
derivatives.

The
following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities
(including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of December 31, 2008, and indicates the fair value
hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such
fair value.

(6)       Indexed
Debt Securities (ZENS) and Time Warner Securities

(a)         Original
Investment in Time Warner Securities

In 1995,
the Company sold a cable television subsidiary to TW and received TW convertible
preferred stock (TW Preferred) as partial consideration. In July 1999, the
Company converted its 11 million shares of TW Preferred into
45.8 million shares of TW Common. A subsidiary of the Company now holds
21.6 million shares of TW Common which are classified as trading securities
under SFAS No. 115 and are expected to be held to facilitate the Company’s
ability to meet its obligation under the 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable
Subordinated Notes due 2029

(ZENS).
Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value of the TW
Common are recorded in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated
Income.

(b)        ZENS

In
September 1999, the Company issued its ZENS having an original principal amount
of $1.0 billion. ZENS are exchangeable for cash equal to the market value
of a specified number of shares of TW common. The Company pays interest on the
ZENS at an annual rate of 2% plus the amount of any quarterly cash dividends
paid in respect of the shares of TW Common attributable to the ZENS. The
principal amount of ZENS is subject to being increased or decreased to the
extent that the annual yield from interest and cash dividends on the reference
shares of TW Common is less than or more than 2.309%. This is defined in the
ZENS instrument as “contingent principal.” At December 31, 2008, ZENS
having an original principal amount of $840 million and a contingent
principal amount of $817 million were outstanding and were exchangeable, at
the option of the holders, for cash equal to 95% of the market value of
21.6 million shares of TW Common deemed to be attributable to the ZENS. At
December 31, 2008, the market value of such shares was approximately
$218 million, which would provide an exchange amount of $246 for each
$1,000 original principal amount of ZENS. At maturity of the ZENS in 2029, the
Company will be obligated to pay in cash the higher of the contingent principal
amount of the ZENS or an amount based on the then-current market value of TW
Common, or other securities distributed with respect to TW Common.

The ZENS
obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component (the
holder’s option to receive the appreciated value of TW Common at maturity). The
bifurcated debt component accretes through interest charges at 17.4% annually up
to the contingent principal amount of the ZENS in 2029. Such accretion will be
reduced by annual cash interest payments, as described above. The derivative
component is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the
derivative component are recorded in the Company’s Statements of
Consolidated



Income.
During 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company recorded a gain (loss) of
$94 million, $(114) million and $(139) million, respectively, on
the Company’s investment in TW Common. During 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company
recorded a gain (loss) of $(80) million, $111 million and
$128 million, respectively, associated with the fair value of the
derivative component of the ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of the TW
Common held by the Company are expected to substantially offset changes in the
fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS.

The
following table sets forth summarized financial information regarding the
Company’s investment in TW Common and the Company’s ZENS obligation (in
millions).

1,000,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock and
20,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock.

(b)         Shareholder
Rights Plan

The
Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan that states that each share of its common
stock includes one associated preference stock purchase right (Right) which
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preference Stock. The Rights, which
expire on December 11, 2011, are exercisable upon some events involving the
acquisition of 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Upon the
occurrence of such an event, each Right entitles the holder to receive common
stock with a current market price equal to two times the exercise price of the
Right. At any time prior to becoming exercisable, the Company may repurchase the
Rights at a price of $0.005 per Right. There are 700,000 shares of
Series A Preference Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of the
Rights.

The
      Company’s ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and an
      embedded derivative component. For additional information regarding ZENS,
      see Note 6(b). As ZENS are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option
      of the holders, these notes are classified as a current portion of
      long-term debt.

      premium related to fair value adjustments of long-term debt of
      $3 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2008, which is being
      amortized over the respective remaining term of the related long-term
      debt.



(a)         Short-term
Borrowings

Receivables
Facility.

On November 25, 2008, CERC replaced a receivables
facility that had terminated on October 28, 2008 with a new 364-day
receivables facility. Availability under the new facility ranges from
$128 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in
receivables balances. At December 31, 2007 and 2008 the facility size was
$300 and $128 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008,
advances under the receivables facilities were $232 million and
$78 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, advances had an
interest rate of 3.81%.

Inventory
Financing.

In December 2008, CERC entered into an asset
management agreement whereby it sold $110 million of its natural gas in
storage and agreed to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the
2008-2009 winter heating season for payments totaling $114 million. This
transaction was accounted for as a financing and, as of December 31, 2008,
the Company’s financial statements reflect natural gas inventory of
$75 million and a financing obligation of $75 million related to this
transaction.

Revolving Credit
Facility.

In November 2008, CenterPoint Houston entered
into a $600 million 364-day credit facility. The $600 million
CenterPoint Houston credit facility will terminate if bonds are issued to
securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike and if those bonds
are issued prior to the November 24, 2009 expiration of the facility.
CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and regulatory approval for the
issuance of such bonds during 2009.

The
$600 million CenterPoint Houston credit facility is secured by a pledge of
$600 million of general mortgage bonds issued by CenterPoint Houston.
Borrowing costs for London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans will be at
a margin of 2.25 percent above LIBOR rates, based on CenterPoint Houston’s
current ratings. In addition, CenterPoint Houston will pay lenders, based on
current ratings, a per annum commitment fee of 0.5 percent for their
commitments under the facility and a quarterly duration fee of 0.75 percent
on the average amount of outstanding borrowings during the quarter. The spread
to LIBOR and the commitment fee fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating.
The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition and
other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant. As of
December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the
$600 million CenterPoint Houston credit facility.

(b)         Long-term
Debt

Senior Notes and General Mortgage
Bonds

. In May 2008, the Company issued $300 million aggregate
principal amount of senior notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%.
The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate
purposes, including the satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection
with conversions of the Company’s 3.75% convertible senior
notes.

In May
2008, CERC Corp. issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior
notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.00%. The proceeds from the sale
of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including capital
expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in
affiliates.

In
January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal
amount of general mortgage bonds, due in March 2014 with an interest rate of
7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate
purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving
credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration
costs associated with Hurricane Ike.

Revolving Credit
Facilities.

The Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility
has a first-drawn cost of LIBOR plus 55 basis points based on the Company’s
current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition
bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so that the permitted
ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current level for the
remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that the permitted
ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the earlier of
December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston’s issuance of bonds to securitize
the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the permitted
ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November 2008
modification.



CenterPoint
Houston’s $289 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45
basis points based on CenterPoint Houston’s current credit ratings. The facility
contains a debt (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization
covenant.

CERC
Corp.’s $950 million credit facility’s first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45
basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current credit ratings. The facility contains
a debt to total capitalization covenant.

Under the
Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston’s
$289 million credit facility and CERC Corp’s $950 million credit
facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings
any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the
utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating.

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2008, the following loan balances were outstanding
under the Company’s revolving credit facilities (in millions):

credit under its $1.2 billion credit facility and CenterPoint Houston had
approximately $4 million of outstanding letters of credit under its
$289 million credit facility as of both December 31, 2007 and 2008.
There was no commercial paper outstanding that would have been backstopped by
the Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility or CERC Corp.’s
$950 million credit facility at December 31, 2007 and 2008. The
Company, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. were in compliance with all debt
covenants as of December 31, 2008.

a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007, in
February 2008 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately
$488 million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of
4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates of February 2020 and February 2023,
respectively. Scheduled final payment dates are February 2017 and February 2020.
Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized
transition property of approximately $483 million representing the
remaining balance of the CTC less an environmental refund as reduced by the fuel
reconciliation settlement amount. See Note 3(b) for further
discussion.

Convertible
Debt.

On May 19, 2003, the Company issued
$575 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due
May 15, 2023 with an interest rate of 3.75%.

In the
fourth quarter of 2007, holders of the Company’s 3.75% convertible senior notes
converted approximately $40 million principal amount of such notes.
Substantially all of such conversions were settled with a cash payment for the
principal amount and delivery of 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common
stock for the excess value due converting holders.

In April
2008, the Company called its 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on
May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible
at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted
for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the
year ended December 31, 2008, the Company issued 16.9 million shares
of its common stock and paid cash of approximately $532 million to settle
conversions of approximately $535 million principal amount of its 3.75%
convertible senior notes.

In
December 2006, the Company called its 2.875% convertible senior notes
for redemption on January 22, 2007. The 2.875% convertible senior
notes became immediately convertible at the option of the holders upon the call
for redemption and were convertible through the close of business on the
redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2.875% convertible senior notes were converted in January
2007.



The
$255 million principal amount of the 2.875% convertible senior notes
was settled in cash and the excess value due converting holders of
$97 million was settled by delivering approximately 5.6 million shares
of the Company’s common stock.

Purchase of Pollution Control
Bonds.

In April 2008, the Company purchased $175 million
principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on its behalf at 102% of
their principal amount. Prior to the purchase, $100 million principal
amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 7.75% and $75 million
principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 8%. Depending on
market conditions, the Company may remarket both series of bonds, at 100% of
their principal amounts, in 2009.

Maturities.

The
Company’s maturities of long-term debt, capital leases and sinking fund
requirements, excluding the ZENS obligation, are $216 million in 2009,
$438 million in 2010, $815 million in 2011, $1.8 billion in 2012
and $1.5 billion in 2013.

Liens.

As of
December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston’s assets were subject to liens
securing approximately $253 million of first mortgage bonds. Sinking or
improvement fund and replacement fund requirements on the first mortgage bonds
may be satisfied by certification of property additions. Sinking fund and
replacement fund requirements for 2006, 2007 and 2008 have been satisfied by
certification of property additions. The replacement fund requirement to be
satisfied in 2009 is approximately $170 million, and the sinking fund
requirement to be satisfied in 2009 is approximately $3 million. The
Company expects CenterPoint Houston to meet these 2009 obligations by
certification of property additions. As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint
Houston’s assets were also subject to liens securing approximately
$2.6 billion of general mortgage bonds which are junior to the liens of the
first mortgage bonds.

Changes
in the Texas State Franchise Tax Law (Texas margin tax) resulted in classifying
Texas margin tax of approximately $8 million, net of federal income tax
effect, as income tax expense in 2008 for CenterPoint Houston. The 2007 state
income tax benefit of $10 million includes a benefit of approximately
$30 million, net of federal income tax effect, as a result of the Texas
margin tax and a Texas state tax examination for the tax years 2002 through
2004.

The tax
effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

Tax Attribute Carryforwards and
Valuation Allowance.

At December 31, 2008, the Company
has approximately $138 million of state net operating loss carryforwards
which expire in various years between 2009 and 2028. A valuation allowance has
been established for approximately $60 million of the state net operating
loss carryforwards that may not be realized. The Company has a state tax credit
carryforward of approximately $44 million which expires in 2026. At
December 31, 2008, the Company has approximately $244 million of state
capital loss carryforwards which expire in 2017 for which a valuation allowance
has been established.



Uncertain Income Tax
Positions

.  The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on
January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company
recognized a decrease of approximately $2 million in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the
January 1, 2007 accumulated deficit. A reconciliation of the change in
unrecognized tax benefits for 2007 and 2008 is as follows:

The
Company has approximately $10 million and $14 million of unrecognized

2007 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties as a
component of income tax expense. The Company recognized approximately
$3 million and $6 million of interest on uncertain income tax
positions during 2007 and 2008, respectively. The Company had accrued
$4 million and $10 million of interest on uncertain income tax
positions at December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The Company does not
expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the
next 12 months.

Tax Audits and
Settlements.

The Company’s consolidated federal income tax
returns have been audited and settled through the 2003 tax year. The Company is
currently under examination by the IRS for tax years 2004 through 2007 and is at
various stages of the examination process. The Company has considered the
effects of these examinations in its accrual for settled issues and liability
for uncertain income tax positions as of December 31, 2008.

In the
fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reached a final settlement with the IRS on
the ACES and ZENS issues and executed a closing agreement on the ZENS resulting
in a net reduction in income tax expense in 2006 of approximately
$92 million. The Company also reached a tentative settlement on other tax
issues, including those related to prior acquisitions and dispositions,
resulting in a reduction in income tax expense for 2006 of approximately
$26 million.

(10)           Commitments
and Contingencies

(a)         Natural
Gas Supply Commitments

Natural
gas supply commitments include natural gas contracts related to the Company’s
Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business
segments, which have various quantity requirements and durations, that are not
classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and December 31,
2008 as these contracts meet the SFAS No. 133 exception to be classified as
“normal purchases contracts” or do not meet the definition of a derivative.
Natural gas supply commitments also include natural gas transportation contracts
that do not meet the definition of a derivative. As of December 31, 2008,
minimum payment obligations for natural gas supply commitments are approximately
$776 million in 2009, $474 million in 2010, $437 million in 2011,
$430 million in 2012, $447 million in 2013 and $956 million in
2014 and thereafter.



(b)         Lease
Commitments

The
following table sets forth information concerning the Company’s obligations

(c)       Other
Commitments

In
December 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase software
licenses, support and maintenance over the next five years. As of
December 31, 2008, payment obligations under this agreement are
$5 million in 2009, $7 million in 2010, $6 million in 2011,
$6 million in 2012 and $6 million in 2013.

In 2007,
CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT) completed phases one and two
of its Carthage to Perryville pipeline project with a total capacity of
1.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. In 2008, CEGT completed the Phase
III expansion of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline which increased total
capacity to 1.5 Bcf per day. During the four-year period subsequent to the
in-service date of the pipeline, XTO Energy, CEGT’s anchor shipper, can request,
and subject to mutual negotiations that meet specific financial parameters and
to FERC approval, CEGT would construct a 67-mile extension from CEGT’s
Perryville hub to an interconnect with Texas Eastern Gas Transmission at Union
Church, Mississippi. CEGT filed with FERC on December 5, 2008 to increase the
Carthage to Perryville capacity to approximately 1.9 Bcf per day. The expansion
includes a new compressor unit at two of CEGT’s existing stations and is
currently projected to be placed in service in the second quarter of
2010.

(d)         Legal,
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters

Legal
Matters

RRI
Indemnified Litigation

The
Company, CenterPoint Houston or their predecessor, Reliant Energy, Incorporated
(Reliant Energy), and certain of their former subsidiaries are named as
defendants in several lawsuits described below. Under a master separation
agreement between the Company and Reliant Energy, Inc. (formerly Reliant
Resources, Inc.) (RRI), the Company and its subsidiaries are entitled to be
indemnified by RRI for any losses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs,
arising out of the lawsuits described below under “Gas Market Manipulation
Cases,” and “Electricity Market Manipulation Cases.” Pursuant to the
indemnification obligation, RRI is defending the Company and its subsidiaries to
the extent named in these lawsuits. Although the ultimate outcome of these
matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Company has not considered it
necessary to establish reserves related to this litigation.

Gas Market Manipulation
Cases

.  A large number of lawsuits were filed against numerous
gas market participants in a number of federal and western state courts in
connection with the operation of the natural gas markets in 2000-2001. The
Company’s former affiliate, RRI, was a participant in gas trading in the
California and Western markets. These lawsuits, many of which have been filed as
class actions, allege violations of state and federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs
in these lawsuits are seeking a variety of forms of relief, including, among
others,  recovery of compensatory damages (in some cases in excess of
$1 billion), a trebling of compensatory damages, full consideration damages
and attorneys’ fees. The Company and/or Reliant Energy were named in
approximately 30 of



these
lawsuits, which were instituted between 2003 and 2007. In October 2006, RRI
reached a settlement of 11 class action natural gas cases pending in state court
in California. The court approved this settlement in June 2007. In the other gas
cases consolidated in state court in California, the Court of Appeals found that
the Company was not a successor to the liabilities of a subsidiary of RRI, and
the Company was dismissed from these suits in April 2008. In the Nevada federal
litigation, three of the complaints were dismissed based on defendants’ filed
rate doctrine defense, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those
dismissals and remanded the cases back to the district court for further
proceedings. In July 2008, the plaintiffs in four of the federal court cases
agreed to dismiss the Company from those cases. In August 2008, the plaintiffs
in five additional cases also agreed to dismiss the Company from those cases,
but one of these plaintiffs has moved to amend its complaint to add CenterPoint
Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of CERC Corp., as a defendant in that case.
As a result, the Company remains a party in only two remaining gas market
manipulation cases, one pending in Nevada state court in Clark County and one in
federal district court in Nevada. The Company believes it is not a proper
defendant in the remaining cases and will continue to pursue dismissal from
those cases.

Electricity Market Manipulation
Cases.

A large number of lawsuits were filed against numerous
market participants in connection with the operation of the California
electricity markets in 2000-2001. The Company’s former affiliate, RRI, was a
participant in the California markets, owning generating plants in the state and
participating in both electricity and natural gas trading in that state and in
western power markets generally. The

Company
was named as a defendant in certain of these suits. These lawsuits, many of
which were filed as class actions and which were based on a number of legal
theories, have all been resolved. In August 2005, RRI reached a settlement with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) enforcement staff, the states of
California, Washington and Oregon, California’s three largest investor-owned
utilities, classes of consumers from California and other western states, and a
number of California city and county government entities that resolves their
claims against RRI  related to the operation of the electricity
markets in California and certain other western states in 2000-2001, including
the claims made by plaintiffs in the suits against RRI naming the Company. The
settlement was approved by the FERC, by the California Public Utilities
Commission and by the courts in which the electricity class action cases were
pending. An appeal by two parties to the California Court of Appeals was denied
with no further appeal sought. A party in the FERC proceedings sought review of
the FERC’s order approving the settlement in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
but in December 2008, that party voluntarily withdrew its petition for
review, and the settlement is now final. The Company is not a party to the
settlement, but may rely on the settlement as a defense to any
claims.

Other
Legal Matters

Natural Gas Measurement
Lawsuits.

CERC Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries are
defendants in a lawsuit filed in 1997 under the Federal False Claims Act
alleging mismeasurement of natural gas produced from federal and Indian lands.
The suit seeks undisclosed damages, along with statutory penalties, interest,
costs and fees. The complaint is part of a larger series of complaints filed
against 77 natural gas pipelines and their subsidiaries and affiliates. An
earlier single action making substantially similar allegations against the
pipelines was dismissed by the federal district court for the District of
Columbia on grounds of improper joinder and lack of jurisdiction. As a result,
the various individual complaints were filed in numerous courts throughout the
country. This case has been consolidated, together with the other similar False
Claims Act cases, in the federal district court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In October
2006, the judge considering this matter granted the defendants’ motion to
dismiss the suit on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
over the claims asserted. The plaintiff has sought review of that dismissal from
the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the matter remains
pending.

In
addition, CERC Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in two
mismeasurement lawsuits brought against approximately 245 pipeline companies and
their affiliates pending in state court in Stevens County, Kansas. In one case
(originally filed in May 1999 and amended four times), the plaintiffs purport to
represent a class of royalty owners who allege that the defendants have engaged
in systematic mismeasurement of the volume of natural gas for more than 25
years. The plaintiffs amended their petition in this suit in July 2003 in
response to an order from the judge denying certification of the plaintiffs’
alleged class. In the amendment the plaintiffs dismissed their claims against
certain defendants (including two CERC Corp. subsidiaries), limited the scope of
the class of plaintiffs they purport to represent and eliminated previously
asserted claims based on mismeasurement of the British thermal unit (Btu)
content of the gas. The same plaintiffs then filed a second lawsuit, again as
representatives of a putative class of royalty owners, in which they assert
their claims that the defendants have engaged in



systematic
mismeasurement of the Btu content of natural gas for more than 25 years. In both
lawsuits, the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, along with statutory
penalties, treble damages, interest, costs and fees. CERC believes that there
has been no systematic mismeasurement of gas and that the lawsuits are without
merit. CERC does not expect the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits to have a
material impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
of either the Company or CERC.

Gas Cost Recovery
Litigation.

In October 2002, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of
certain CERC ratepayers in state district court in Wharton County, Texas against
the Company, CERC Corp., Entex Gas Marketing Company (EGMC), and certain
non-affiliated companies alleging fraud, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act, violations of the Texas Utilities Code, civil conspiracy and
violations of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act with respect to rates
charged to certain consumers of natural gas in the State of Texas. The
plaintiffs initially sought certification of a class of Texas ratepayers, but
subsequently dropped their request for class certification. The plaintiffs later
added as defendants CenterPoint Energy Marketing Inc., CenterPoint Energy
Pipeline Services, Inc. (CEPS), and certain other subsidiaries of CERC, and
other non-affiliated companies. In February 2005, the case was removed to
federal district court in Houston, Texas, and in March 2005, the plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed the case and agreed not to refile the claims asserted
unless the Miller County case described below is not certified as a class action
or is later decertified.

In
October 2004, a lawsuit was filed by certain CERC ratepayers in Texas and
Arkansas in circuit court in Miller County, Arkansas against the Company, CERC
Corp., EGMC, CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT), CenterPoint
Energy Field Services (CEFS), CEPS, Mississippi River Transmission Corp. (MRT)
and various non-affiliated companies alleging fraud, unjust enrichment and civil
conspiracy with respect to rates charged to certain consumers of natural gas in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Subsequently,
the plaintiffs dropped CEGT and MRT as defendants. Although the plaintiffs in
the Miller County case sought class certification, no class was certified. In
June 2007, the Arkansas Supreme Court determined that the Arkansas claims were
within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Arkansas Public Service
Commission (APSC). In response to that ruling, in August 2007 the Miller County
court stayed but refused to dismiss the Arkansas claims. In February 2008, the
Arkansas Supreme Court directed the Miller County court to dismiss the entire
case for lack of jurisdiction. The Miller County court subsequently dismissed
the case in accordance with the Arkansas Supreme Court’s mandate and all
appellate deadlines have expired.

In June
2007, the Company, CERC Corp., EGMC and other defendants in the Miller County
case filed a petition in a district court in Travis County, Texas seeking a
determination that the Railroad Commission has exclusive original jurisdiction
over the Texas claims asserted in the Miller County case. In October 2007, CEFS
and CEPS joined the petition in the Travis County case. In October 2008, the
district court ruled that the Railroad Commission had exclusive original
jurisdiction over the Texas claims asserted against the Company, CERC Corp.,
EGMC and the other defendants in the Miller County case. In January 2009, the
court entered a final declaratory judgment ruling that the Railroad Commission
has exclusive jurisdiction over Texas claims. The Company does not anticipate
that an appeal will be filed.

In August
2007, the Arkansas plaintiff in the Miller County litigation initiated a
complaint at the APSC seeking a decision concerning the extent of the APSC’s
jurisdiction over the Miller County case and an investigation into the merits of
the allegations asserted in his complaint with respect to CERC. In February
2009, the Arkansas plaintiff notified the APSC that he would no longer pursue
his claims. That complaint remains pending at the APSC, subject to the review of
the Arkansas Attorney General, APSC Staff and the APSC.

In
February 2003, a lawsuit was filed in state court in Caddo Parish, Louisiana
against CERC with respect to rates charged to a purported class of certain
consumers of natural gas and gas service in the State of Louisiana. In February
2004, another suit was filed in state court in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana
against CERC seeking to recover alleged overcharges for gas or gas services
allegedly provided by CERC to a purported class of certain consumers of natural
gas and gas service without advance approval by the Louisiana Public Service
Commission (LPSC). At the time of the filing of each of the Caddo and Calcasieu
Parish cases, the plaintiffs in those cases filed petitions with the LPSC
relating to the same alleged rate overcharges. The Caddo and Calcasieu Parish
lawsuits were stayed pending the resolution of the petitions filed with the
LPSC. In August 2007, the LPSC issued an order approving a Stipulated Settlement
in the review initiated by the plaintiffs in the Calcasieu Parish litigation. In
the LPSC proceeding, CERC’s gas purchases were reviewed back to 1971. The review
concluded that CERC’s gas costs were



“reasonable
and prudent,” but CERC agreed to credit to jurisdictional customers
approximately $920,000, including interest, related to certain off-system sales.
The refund was completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. A similar review by the
LPSC related to the Caddo Parish litigation was resolved without additional
payment by CERC. In October 2008, the courts considering the Caddo and Calcasieu
Parish cases dismissed these cases pursuant to motions to dismiss and these
proceedings have been concluded.

Storage Facility
Litigation.

In February 2007, an Oklahoma district court in
Coal County, Oklahoma, granted a summary judgment against CEGT in a case, Deka
Exploration, Inc. v. CenterPoint Energy, filed by holders of oil and gas
leaseholds and some mineral interest owners in lands underlying CEGT’s Chiles
Dome Storage Facility. The dispute concerns “native gas” that may have been in
the Wapanucka formation underlying the Chiles Dome facility when that facility
was constructed in 1979 by a CERC entity that was the predecessor in interest of
CEGT. The court ruled that the plaintiffs own native gas underlying those lands,
since neither CEGT nor its predecessors had condemned those ownership interests.
The court rejected CEGT’s contention that the claim should be barred by the
statute of limitations, since the suit was filed over 25 years after the
facility was constructed. The court also rejected CEGT’s contention that the
suit is an impermissible attack on the determinations the FERC and Oklahoma
Corporation Commission made regarding the absence of native gas in the lands
when the facility was constructed. The summary judgment ruling was only on the
issue of liability, though the court did rule that CEGT has the burden

of
proving that any gas in the Wapanucka formation is gas that has been injected
and is not native gas. Further hearings and orders of the court are required to
specify the appropriate relief for the plaintiffs. CEGT plans to appeal through
the Oklahoma court system any judgment that imposes liability on CEGT in this
matter. The Company and CERC do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a
material impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
of either the Company or CERC.

Environmental
Matters

Manufactured Gas Plant
Sites.

CERC and its predecessors operated manufactured gas
plants (MGPs) in the past. In Minnesota, CERC has completed remediation on two
sites, other than ongoing monitoring and water treatment. There are five
remaining sites in CERC’s Minnesota service territory. CERC believes that it has
no liability with respect to two of these sites.

At
December 31, 2008, CERC had accrued $14 million for remediation of
these Minnesota sites and the estimated range of possible remediation costs for
these sites was $4 million to $35 million based on remediation
continuing for 30 to 50 years. The cost estimates are based on studies of a site
or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual
remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to be remediated,
the participation of other potentially responsible parties (PRP), if any, and
the remediation methods used. CERC has utilized an environmental expense tracker
mechanism in its rates in Minnesota to recover estimated costs in excess of
insurance recovery. As of December 31, 2008, CERC had collected
$13 million from insurance companies and rate payers to be used for future
environmental remediation.

In
addition to the Minnesota sites, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or
operated by CERC or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates. CERC
has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the United States District
Court, District of Maine, under which contribution is sought by private parties
for the cost to remediate former MGP sites based on the previous ownership of
such sites by former affiliates of CERC or its divisions. CERC has also been
identified as a PRP by the State of Maine for a site that is the subject of the
lawsuit. In June 2006, the federal district court in Maine ruled that the
current owner of the site is responsible for site remediation but that an
additional evidentiary hearing is required to determine if other potentially
responsible parties, including CERC, would have to contribute to that
remediation. The Company is investigating details regarding the site and the
range of environmental expenditures for potential remediation. However, CERC
believes it is not liable as a former owner or operator of the site under the
Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended, and applicable state statutes, and is vigorously contesting the suit
and its designation as a PRP.

Mercury
Contamination.

The Company’s pipeline and distribution
operations have in the past employed elemental mercury in measuring and
regulating equipment. It is possible that small amounts of mercury may have been
spilled in the course of normal maintenance and replacement operations and that
these spills may have contaminated the immediate area with elemental mercury.
The Company has found this type of contamination at



some
sites in the past, and the Company has conducted remediation at these sites. It
is possible that other contaminated sites may exist and that remediation costs
may be incurred for these sites. Although the total amount of these costs is not
known at this time, based on the Company’s experience and that of others in the
natural gas industry to date and on the current regulations regarding
remediation of these sites, the Company believes that the costs of any
remediation of these sites will not be material to the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos.

Some
facilities owned by the Company contain or have contained asbestos insulation
and other asbestos-containing materials. The Company or its subsidiaries have
been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a
number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the
claimants have worked at locations owned by the Company, but most existing
claims relate to facilities previously owned by the Company’s subsidiaries. The
Company anticipates that additional claims like those received may be asserted
in the future. In 2004, the Company sold its generating business, to which most
of these claims relate, to Texas Genco LLC, which is now known as NRG Texas LP.
Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating
business from the Company and its sale to NRG Texas LP, ultimate financial
responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating
business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but the Company has agreed to
continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance

maintained
by the Company, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense from the
purchaser. Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time, the
Company intends to continue vigorously contesting claims that it does not
consider to have merit and does not expect, based on its experience to date,
these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

Groundwater Contamination
Litigation.

Predecessor entities of CERC, along with several
other entities, are defendants in litigation,

St. Michel Plantation, LLC, et al,
v. White, et al

., pending in civil district court in Orleans Parish,
Louisiana. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that their property in
Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana suffered salt water contamination as a result of
oil and gas drilling activities conducted by the defendants. Although a
predecessor of CERC held an interest in two oil and gas leases on a portion of
the property at issue, neither it nor any other CERC entities drilled or
conducted other oil and gas operations on those leases. In January 2009, CERC
and the plaintiffs reached agreement on the terms of a settlement that, if
ultimately approved by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and the
court, is expected to finally resolve this litigation. The Company and CERC do
not expect the outcome of this litigation to have a material adverse impact on
the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either the
Company or CERC.

Other
Environmental.

From time to time the Company has received
notices from regulatory authorities or others regarding its status as a PRP in
connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of
environmental contaminants. In addition, the Company has been named from time to
time as a defendant in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate
outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Company does not
expect, based on its experience to date, these matters, either individually or
in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other
Proceedings

The
Company is involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory
proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental
agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of
these proceedings involve substantial amounts. The Company regularly analyzes
current information and, as necessary, provides accruals for probable
liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. The Company does not
expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Guaranties

Prior to
the Company’s distribution of its ownership in RRI to its shareholders, CERC had
guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading
subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies,
RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but
at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish
all obligations. To secure CERC against obligations under the remaining
guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for CERC’s benefit,
and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining
guaranties. In December 2007, the Company, CERC and RRI amended that
agreement and CERC released the letters of credit it held as security. Under the
revised agreement RRI agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure
CERC against



exposure
under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the new agreement if and to
the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a risk of loss on those
guaranties.

The
potential exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demand
charges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demand
charges under these transportation contracts, which will be effective until
2018, was approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2008. RRI
continues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and, on the basis of
market conditions, the Company and CERC have not required additional security.
However, if RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if
RRI should fail to provide adequate security in the event market conditions
change adversely, the Company would retain exposure to the counterparty under
the guaranty.

(11)           Estimated
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair
values of cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities
classified as “available-for-sale” and “trading” in accordance with
SFAS No. 115, and short-term borrowings are estimated to be approximately
equivalent to carrying amounts and have been excluded from the table below. The
fair values of non-trading derivative assets and liabilities are equivalent to
their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,
2007 and 2008 and have been determined using quoted market prices for the same
or similar instruments when available or other estimation techniques (see Notes
4 and 5). Therefore, these financial instruments are stated at fair value and
are excluded from the table below.

(12)           Earnings
Per Share

The
following table reconciles numerators and denominators of the Company’s basic
and diluted earnings per share calculations:

__________



(1)

Options
      to purchase 5,863,907, 3,225,969 and 2,617,772 shares were
      outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
      respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
      per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average
      market price of the common shares for the respective
  years.

All of the 2.875%
contingently convertible senior notes and substantially all of the 3.75%
contingently convertible senior notes provided for settlement of the principal
portion in cash rather than stock.

In accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 04-8, “Accounting Issues related to Certain Features of
Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the
portion of the conversion value of such notes that must be settled in cash
rather than stock is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
from continuing operations. The Company included the conversion spread in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share when the average market price of the
Company’s common stock in the respective reporting period exceeded the
conversion price.

All of the Company’s
2.875% convertible senior notes were either redeemed or surrendered for
conversion in January 2007 and substantially all of the Company’s 3.75%
convertible senior notes were submitted for conversion on or prior to the May
30, 2008 redemption date, as described in Note 8(b), “Long-term Debt —
Convertible Debt.”

Quarterly
      earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
      shares outstanding during the quarter, and the sum of the quarters may not
      equal annual earnings per common share. The Company included the
      conversion spread related to its contingently convertible senior notes in
      the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the average market
      price of the Company’s common stock in the respective reporting period
      exceeds the conversion price. All of the Company’s 2.875% convertible
      senior notes were either redeemed or surrendered for conversion in January
      2007 and substantially all of the Company’s 3.75% convertible senior notes
      were submitted for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption
      date, as described in Note 8(b), “Long-term Debt — Convertible
      Debt.”

(14)           Reportable
Business Segments

The
Company’s determination of reportable business segments considers the strategic
operating units under which the Company manages sales, allocates resources and
assesses performance of various products and services to wholesale or retail
customers in differing regulatory environments. The accounting policies of the
business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies except that some executive benefit costs have not been
allocated to business segments. The Company uses operating income as the measure
of profit or loss for its business segments.



The
Company’s reportable business segments include the following: Electric
Transmission & Distribution, Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive
Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines, Field Services and Other
Operations. The rate-regulated electric transmission and distribution function
(CenterPoint Houston) is reported in the Electric Transmission &
Distribution business segment. Natural Gas Distribution consists of
rate-regulated intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation
and distribution for, residential, commercial, industrial and institutional
customers. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services represents the Company’s
non-rate regulated gas sales and services operations, which consist of three
operational functions: wholesale, retail and intrastate pipelines.

The Interstate

Pipelines business segment
includes the interstate natural gas pipeline operations. The Field Services
business segment includes the natural gas gathering operations. Other Operations
consists primarily of other corporate operations which support all of the
Company’s business operations.

Long-lived
assets include net property, plant and equipment, net goodwill and other
intangibles and equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries. Intersegment
sales are eliminated in consolidation.

CENTERPOINT
ENERGY, INC.

SCHEDULE I —
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (PARENT COMPANY)

(1)

Background.

The condensed parent company
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes of CenterPoint Energy, Inc.
(CenterPoint Energy or the Company) appearing in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Bank facilities at CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and
CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company, limit debt, excluding transition bonds, as a percentage of their total
capitalization to 65%. These covenants could restrict the ability of these
subsidiaries to distribute dividends to the Company.

(2)

Derivatives.

In December 2007 and
January 2008, the Company entered into treasury rate lock derivative instruments
(treasury rate locks) having an aggregate notional amount of $300 million
and a weighted-average locked U.S. treasury rate on ten-year debt of 4.05%.
These treasury rate locks were executed to hedge the ten-year U.S. treasury rate
expected to be used in pricing $300 million of fixed-rate debt the Company
planned to issue in 2008, because changes in the U.S treasury rate would cause
variability in the Company’s forecasted interest payments. These treasury rate
lock derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, unrealized
gains and losses associated with the treasury rate lock derivative instruments
were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In May
2008, the Company settled its treasury rate locks for a payment of
$7 million. The $7 million loss recognized upon settlement of the
treasury rate locks was recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss and will be recognized as a component of interest expense
over the ten-year life of the related $300 million senior notes issued in
May 2008. Amortization of amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive
loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was less than $1 million.
During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Company recognized a
loss of $2 million and $5 million, respectively, for these treasury
rate locks in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Ineffectiveness for the
treasury rate locks was not material during the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2008.

(3)

Long-term Debt.

In May 2008, the
Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%. The proceeds from the sale of the
senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the
satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection with conversions of the
Company’s 3.75% convertible senior notes.

The
Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility has a first-drawn cost of London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on the Company’s
current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition
bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so that the permitted
ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current level for the
remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that the permitted
ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the earlier of
December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston’s issuance of bonds to securitize
the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the permitted
ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November 2008
modification.

Under the
Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5
basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is
utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the
borrower’s credit rating.

As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had $264 million of borrowings and
approximately $27 million of outstanding letters of credit under its
$1.2 billion credit facility. The Company had no commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 2008. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants as of December 31, 2008.

On
May 19, 2003, the Company issued $575 million aggregate principal
amount of convertible senior notes due May 15, 2023 with an interest rate
of 3.75%.

In the
fourth quarter of 2007, holders of the Company’s 3.75% convertible senior notes
converted approximately $40 million principal amount of such notes.
Substantially all of such conversions were settled with a cash payment for the
principal amount and delivery of 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common
stock for the excess value due converting holders.



In April
2008, the Company called its 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on
May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible
at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted
for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the
year ended December 31, 2008, the Company issued 16.9 million shares
of its common stock and paid cash of approximately $532 million to settle
conversions of approximately $535 million principal amount of its 3.75%
convertible senior notes.

In
December 2006, the Company called its 2.875% convertible senior notes
for redemption on January 22, 2007. The 2.875% convertible senior
notes became immediately convertible at the option of the holders upon the call
for redemption and were convertible through the close of business on the
redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2.875% convertible senior notes were converted in January 2007.
The $255 million principal amount of the 2.875% convertible senior
notes was settled in cash and the excess value due converting holders of
$97 million was settled by delivering approximately 5.6 million shares
of the Company’s common stock.

In April
2008, the Company purchased $175 million principal amount of pollution
control bonds issued on its behalf at 102% of their principal amount. Prior to
the purchase, $100 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate
of interest of 7.75% and $75 million principal amount of such bonds had a
fixed rate of interest of 8%. Depending on market conditions, the Company may
remarket both series of bonds, at 100% of their principal amounts, in
2009.
