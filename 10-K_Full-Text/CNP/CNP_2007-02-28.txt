Business

OUR
    BUSINESS

Overview

We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly
    owned subsidiaries include:

•

CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston),
    which engages in the electric transmission and distribution
    business in a

5,000-square

mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and

•

CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and, together
    with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural
    gas distribution systems in six states. Wholly owned
    subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines
    and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary
    services. Another wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers
    variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily
    to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas
    utilities.

Prior to repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    1935 (1935 Act), effective February 8, 2006, we were a
    registered public utility holding company under that act.

Our reportable business segments are Electric
    Transmission & Distribution, Natural Gas Distribution,
    Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate
    Pipelines, Field Services and Other Operations. Prior to the
    fourth quarter of 2006, our Interstate Pipelines business
    segment and our Field Services business segment were reported as
    a single business segment called Pipelines and Field Services.
    Information from prior periods has been recast to reflect this
    new presentation. The operations of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc.
    (Texas Genco), formerly our majority owned electric generating
    subsidiary, the sale of which was completed in April 2005, are
    presented as discontinued operations. From time to time, we
    consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or

Electric
    Transmission & Distribution

In 1999, the Texas legislature adopted the Texas Electric Choice
    Plan (Texas electric restructuring law) that led to the
    restructuring of integrated electric utilities operating within
    Texas. Pursuant to that legislation, integrated electric
    utilities operating within the Electric Reliability Council of
    Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) were required to separate



their integrated operations into separate retail sales, power
    generation and transmission and distribution companies. The
    legislation also required that the prices for wholesale
    generation and retail electric sales be unregulated, but rates
    and services by companies providing transmission and
    distribution service, such as CenterPoint Houston, would
    continue to be rate regulated by the Public Utility Commission
    of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). The legislation provided
    for a transition period to move to the new market structure and
    provided a

true-up

mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to
    recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the
    transition to competition. Those costs are recoverable after
    approval by the Texas Utility Commission either through the
    issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation
    of a competition transition charge (CTC) as a rider to the
    utility’s tariff.

CenterPoint Houston is the only business of CenterPoint Energy
    that continues to engage in electric utility operations. It is a
    transmission and distribution electric utility that operates
    wholly within the state of Texas. Neither CenterPoint Houston
    nor any other subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy makes sales of
    electric energy at retail or wholesale or owns or operates any
    electric generating facilities.

Electric
    Transmission

On behalf of retail electric providers (REPs), CenterPoint
    Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations,
    from one substation to another and to retail electric customers
    taking power above 69 kilovolts (kV) in locations throughout the
    control area managed by ERCOT. CenterPoint Houston provides
    transmission services under tariffs approved by the Texas
    Utility Commission.

Electric
    Distribution

In ERCOT, end users purchase their electricity directly from
    certificated REPs. CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity for
    REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lower-voltage
    power from the substation to the retail electric customer.
    CenterPoint Houston’s distribution network receives
    electricity from the transmission grid through power
    distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users
    through distribution feeders. CenterPoint Houston’s
    operations include construction and maintenance of electric
    transmission and distribution facilities, metering services,
    outage response services and call center operations. CenterPoint
    Houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by
    the Texas Utility Commission. Texas Utility Commission rules and
    market protocols govern the commercial operations of
    distribution companies and other market participants.

ERCOT
    Market Framework

CenterPoint Houston is a member of ERCOT. ERCOT serves as the
    regional reliability coordinating council for member electric
    power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer
    groups, investor and municipally owned electric utilities, rural
    electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers
    and REPs. The ERCOT market includes much of the State of Texas,
    other than a portion of the panhandle, a portion of the eastern
    part of the state bordering Louisiana and the area in and around
    El Paso. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of
    the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s
    largest power markets. The ERCOT market includes an aggregate
    net generating capacity of approximately 70,500 megawatts (MW).
    There are only limited direct current interconnections between
    the ERCOT market and other power markets in the
    United States.

The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council. The Texas
    Utility Commission has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT
    market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity
    supply across the state’s main interconnected power
    transmission grid. The ERCOT independent system operator (ERCOT
    ISO) is responsible for maintaining reliable operations of the
    bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Its
    responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production
    and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation
    resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike certain other
    regional power markets, the ERCOT market is not a centrally
    dispatched power pool, and the ERCOT ISO does not procure energy
    on behalf of its members other than to maintain the reliable
    operations of the transmission system. Members who sell and
    purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and
    purchases of power bilaterally. The ERCOT ISO also serves as
    agent for procuring ancillary services for those members who
    elect not to provide their own ancillary services.



CenterPoint Houston’s electric transmission business, along
    with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas,
    supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. The transmission
    business has planning, design, construction, operation and
    maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission
    grid and for the load-serving substations it owns, primarily
    within its certificated area. We participate with the ERCOT ISO
    and other ERCOT utilities to plan, design, obtain regulatory
    approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to
    increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing
    constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.

True-Up

Proceeding

The Texas electric restructuring law substantially amended the
    regulatory structure governing electric utilities in order to
    allow retail competition for electric customers beginning in
    January 2002. The Texas electric restructuring law required the
    Texas Utility Commission to conduct a

“true-up”

proceeding to determine CenterPoint Houston’s stranded
    costs and certain other costs resulting from the transition to a
    competitive retail electric market and to provide for its
    recovery of those costs.

In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its

true-up

application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting
    recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed
    under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004,
    the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order

(True-Up

Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a

true-up

balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included
    interest through August 31, 2004, and providing for
    adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on
    the balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional
    excess mitigation credits returned to customers after
    August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties filed appeals of the

True-Up

Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August
    2005, the court issued its final judgment on the various
    appeals. In its judgment, the court affirmed most aspects of the

True-Up

Order, but reversed two of the Texas Utility Commission’s
    rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoring
    approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the
    $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed
    from CenterPoint Houston’s initial request. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s
    judgment. Oral arguments before the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals were held in January 2007, but a decision is not
    expected for several months. No amounts related to the district
    court’s judgment have been recorded in our consolidated
    financial statements.

Among the issues raised in CenterPoint Houston’s appeal of
    the

True-Up

Order is the Texas Utility Commission’s reduction of
    CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by
    approximately $146 million for the present value of certain
    deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric
    generation assets. Such reduction was considered in our
    recording of an after-tax extraordinary loss of
    $977 million in the last half of 2004. We believe that the
    Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed regulations
    issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in March 2003
    related to those tax benefits. Those proposed regulations would
    have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated
    before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass
    the benefits of Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits
    (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal Income Taxes (EDFIT) back to
    customers. However, in December 2005, the IRS withdrew those
    proposed normalization regulations and issued new proposed
    regulations that do not include the provision allowing a
    retroactive election to pass the tax benefits back to customers.
    In a May 2006 Private Letter Ruling (PLR) issued to a Texas
    utility on facts similar to CenterPoint Houston’s, the IRS,
    without referencing its proposed regulations, ruled that a
    normalization violation would occur if ADITC and EDFIT were
    required to be returned to customers. CenterPoint Houston has
    requested a PLR asking the IRS whether the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s
    stranded cost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT
    would cause a normalization violation. If the IRS determines
    that such reduction would cause a normalization violation with
    respect to the ADITC and the Texas Utility Commission’s
    order relating to such reduction is not reversed or otherwise
    modified, the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to
    CenterPoint Houston’s unamortized ADITC balance as of the
    date that the normalization violation is deemed to have
    occurred. In addition, if a normalization violation with respect
    to EDFIT is deemed to have occurred and the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order relating to such reduction is not
    reversed or otherwise modified, the IRS could deny CenterPoint
    Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation
    benefits beginning in the taxable year that the normalization
    violation is deemed to have occurred. If a normalization
    violation should ultimately be found to exist, it could have a
    material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows. However, we and CenterPoint Houston
    are vigorously pursuing the appeal of



this issue and will seek other relief from the Texas Utility
    Commission to avoid a normalization violation. The Texas Utility
    Commission has not previously required a company subject to its
    jurisdiction to take action that would result in a normalization
    violation.

Securitization

Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility
    Commission in March 2005 and affirmed in August 2005 by a Travis
    County district court, in December 2005, a subsidiary of
    CenterPoint Houston issued $1.85 billion in transition
    bonds with interest rates ranging from 4.84 percent to
    5.30 percent and final maturity dates ranging from February
    2011 to August 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds,
    CenterPoint Houston recovered approximately $1.7 billion of
    the

true-up

balance determined in the

True-Up

Order plus interest through the date on which the bonds were
    issued.

Competition
    Transition Charge

In July 2005, CenterPoint Houston received an order from the
    Texas Utility Commission allowing it to implement a CTC designed
    to collect approximately $596 million over 14 years
    plus interest at an annual rate of 11.075 percent (CTC
    Order). The CTC Order authorizes CenterPoint Houston to impose a
    charge on REPs to recover the portion of the

true-up

balance not covered by the financing order. The CTC Order also
    allows CenterPoint Houston to collect approximately
    $24 million of rate case expenses over three years without
    a return through a separate tariff rider (Rider RCE).
    CenterPoint Houston implemented the CTC and Rider RCE effective
    September 13, 2005 and began recovering approximately
    $620 million. Effective September 13, 2005, the return
    on the CTC portion of the

true-up

balance is included in CenterPoint Houston’s tariff-based
    revenues.

Certain parties appealed the CTC Order to a district court
    in Travis County. In May 2006, the district court issued a
    judgment reversing the CTC Order in three respects. First, the
    court ruled that the Texas Utility Commission had improperly
    relied on provisions of its rule dealing with the interest rate
    applicable to CTC amounts. The district court reached that
    conclusion on the grounds that the Texas Supreme Court had
    previously invalidated that entire section of the rule. Second,
    the district court reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s
    ruling that allows CenterPoint Houston to recover through the
    Rider RCE the costs (approximately $5 million) for a panel
    appointed by the Texas Utility Commission in connection with the
    valuation of the Company’s electric generation assets.
    Finally, the district court accepted the contention of one party
    that the CTC should not be allocated to retail customers that
    have switched to new

on-site

generation. The Texas Utility Commission and CenterPoint Houston
    disagree with the district court’s conclusions and, in May
    2006, appealed the judgment to the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals, and if required, plan to seek further review from the
    Texas Supreme Court. All briefs in the appeal have been filed.
    Oral arguments were held in December 2006. Pending completion of
    judicial review and any action required by the Texas Utility
    Commission following a remand from the courts, the CTC remains
    in effect. The 11.075 percent interest rate in question was
    applicable from the implementation of the CTC Order on
    September 13, 2005 until August 1, 2006, the effective
    date of the implementation of a new CTC in compliance with the
    new rule discussed below. The ultimate outcome of this matter
    cannot be predicted at this time. However, we do not expect the
    disposition of this matter to have a material adverse impact on
    our or CenterPoint Houston’s financial condition, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the Texas Utility Commission adopted the revised
    rule governing the carrying charges on unrecovered

true-up

balances as recommended by its staff (Staff). The rule, which
    applies to CenterPoint Houston, reduced the allowed interest
    rate on the unrecovered CTC balance prospectively from
    11.075 percent to a weighted average cost of capital of
    8.06 percent. The annualized impact on operating income is
    a reduction of approximately $18 million per year for the
    first year with lesser impacts in subsequent years. In July
    2006, CenterPoint Houston made a compliance filing necessary to
    implement the rule changes effective August 1,
    2006 per the settlement agreement discussed under
    “CenterPoint Houston Rate Case” below.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006,
    CenterPoint Houston recognized approximately $19 million
    and $55 million, respectively, in operating income from the
    CTC. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2006, CenterPoint Houston recognized approximately
    $1 million and $13 million, respectively, of the
    allowed equity return not previously recorded. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had not recorded



an allowed equity return of $234 million on CenterPoint
    Houston’s

true-up

balance because such return will be recognized as it is
    recovered in rates.

Refund of
    Environmental Retrofit Costs

The

True-Up

Order allowed recovery of approximately $699 million of
    environmental retrofit costs related to CenterPoint
    Houston’s generation assets. The sale of CenterPoint
    Houston’s interest in its generation assets was completed
    in early 2005. The

True-Up

Order required CenterPoint Houston to provide evidence by
    January 31, 2007 that the entire $699 million was
    actually spent by December 31, 2006 on environmental
    programs. The Texas Utility Commission will determine the
    appropriate manner to return to customers any unused portion of
    these funds, including interest on the funds and on stranded
    costs attributable to the environmental costs portion of the
    stranded costs recovery. In January 2007, we were notified by
    the successor in interest to CenterPoint Houston’s
    generation assets that, as of December 31, 2006, it had
    only spent approximately $664 million. On January 31,
    2007, CenterPoint Houston made the required filing with the
    Texas Utility Commission identifying approximately
    $35 million in unspent funds to be refunded to customers
    along with approximately $7 million of interest and
    requesting permission to refund these amounts through a
    reduction to the CTC, effective March 1, 2007. Such amounts
    are recorded in regulatory liabilities as of December 31,
    2006. In February 2007, the Texas Utility Commission adopted the
    Staff’s recommendation for a slower procedural schedule
    than that requested by CenterPoint Houston. The current
    procedural schedule makes it unlikely that the proposed refund
    would be effective before May 1, 2007. At this time, we
    cannot predict whether any party will oppose CenterPoint
    Houston’s filing or whether the Texas Utility Commission
    will approve CenterPoint Houston’s request.

Final
    Fuel Reconciliation

The results of the Texas Utility Commission’s final
    decision related to CenterPoint Houston’s final fuel
    reconciliation were a component of the

True-Up

Order. CenterPoint Houston has appealed certain portions of the

True-Up

Order involving a disallowance of approximately $67 million
    relating to the final fuel reconciliation in 2003 plus interest
    of $10 million. CenterPoint Houston has fully reserved for
    the disallowance and related interest accrual. A judgment was
    entered by a Travis County district court in May 2005 affirming
    the Texas Utility Commission’s decision. CenterPoint
    Houston filed an appeal to the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals
    in June 2005, and in April 2006, the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals issued a judgment affirming the Texas Utility
    Commission’s decision. CenterPoint Houston filed an appeal
    with the Texas Supreme Court in August 2006, and in October
    2006, the Texas Supreme Court requested that the Texas Utility
    Commission and the City of Houston file written responses to
    CenterPoint Houston’s petition for review. Those responses
    were filed in January 2007. In February 2007, CenterPoint
    Houston filed an agreement with the Texas Supreme Court
    indicating that the parties had reached a settlement of the
    appeal. In order for the settlement to become final, the Texas
    Supreme Court must abate the pending appeal, and the Texas
    Utility Commission must issue a final order approving the
    settlement. If the Texas Utility Commission does not approve the
    agreement or modifies the agreement in a manner unacceptable to
    CenterPoint Houston, CenterPoint Houston would be entitled to
    ask the Texas Supreme Court to reinstate the appeal. If the
    Texas Utility Commission approves the agreement, the parties
    will request the Texas Supreme Court to set aside the lower
    court decisions and remand the case for entry of an order
    approving that settlement. The Texas Supreme Court is not
    required to abate the appeal. If the Texas Supreme Court does
    not abate the appeal, it may request full briefing or deny the
    petition for review. If the petition is denied, the Court of
    Appeals’ judgment would become final. If the petition is
    granted, the Texas Supreme Court would address the merits of
    CenterPoint Houston’s appeal. There is no deadline for the
    Texas Supreme Court’s decisions. As of December 31,
    2006, we have not recorded any amounts related to this decision.

Remand of
    2001 Unbundled Cost of Service (UCOS) Order

The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals remanded to the Texas
    Utility Commission an issue that was decided by the Texas
    Utility Commission in CenterPoint Houston’s 2001 UCOS
    proceeding. In its remand order, the court ruled that the Texas
    Utility Commission had failed to adequately explain the basis
    for its determination of certain projected transmission capital
    expenditures. The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals ordered the
    Texas Utility Commission to reconsider that determination on the
    basis of the record that existed at the time of the Texas
    Utility Commission’s



original order. In April 2006, the Texas Utility Commission
    opined orally that the rate base should be reduced by
    $57 million and instructed the Staff to quantify the effect
    on CenterPoint Houston’s rates. In the settlement of the
    CenterPoint Houston rate case described below, the parties to
    the remand proceeding agreed to settle all issues that could be
    raised in the remand. Under the terms of that settlement,
    CenterPoint Houston implemented riders to its tariff rates under
    which it will provide rate credits to retail and wholesale
    customers for a total of approximately $8 million per year
    until a total of $32 million has been credited to customers
    under those tariff riders. Those riders became effective
    October 10, 2006. CenterPoint Houston reduced revenues and
    established a corresponding regulatory liability of
    $32 million in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect this
    obligation.

CenterPoint
    Houston Rate Case

In September 2006, the Texas Utility Commission approved a
    settlement of a rate proceeding concerning CenterPoint
    Houston’s transmission and distribution service rates,
    which is discussed in “Regulation — State and
    Local Regulation — Electric Transmission and
    Distribution — CenterPoint Houston Rate Case.”

Customers

CenterPoint Houston serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston
    metropolitan area. CenterPoint Houston’s customers consist
    of 68 REPs, which sell electricity in its certificated service
    area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other
    distribution companies located outside CenterPoint
    Houston’s certificated service area. Each REP is licensed
    by, and must meet creditworthiness criteria established by, the
    Texas Utility Commission. Two of the REPs in CenterPoint
    Houston’s service area are subsidiaries of Reliant Energy,
    Inc. (RRI). Sales to subsidiaries of RRI represented
    approximately 71%, 62% and 56% of CenterPoint Houston’s
    transmission and distribution revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. CenterPoint Houston’s billed receivables
    balance from REPs as of December 31, 2006 was
    $140 million. Approximately 53% of this amount was owed by
    subsidiaries of RRI. CenterPoint Houston does not have long-term
    contracts with any of its customers. It operates on a continuous
    billing cycle, with meter readings being conducted and invoices
    being distributed to REPs each business day.

Distribution
    Automation (Intelligent Grid)

CenterPoint Houston is pursuing development and possible
    deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy
    with assistance from IBM that involves the implementation of an
    “Intelligent Grid” which would make use of CenterPoint
    Houston’s lines and other facilities to provide on demand
    data and information about electric usage and the status of
    facilities on our system. Although this technology is still in
    the developmental stage, CenterPoint Houston believes it has the
    potential to enable a significant improvement in metering, grid
    planning, operations and maintenance of its system. These
    improvements would be expected to contribute to fewer and
    shorter outages, better customer service, improved operations
    costs, improved security and more effective use of our
    workforce. CenterPoint Houston is making a limited deployment of
    this technology to help in proving the technology and in
    validating its potential benefits prior to a full-scale
    implementation.

In addition to the utility applications discussed above,
    Intelligent Grid technology has the potential to improve the
    provision of data to the retail electric market in Texas to
    enable such enhancements as real-time pricing, real-time
    switching between REPs, and more timely connection and
    disconnection of customers. CenterPoint Houston anticipates that
    the Texas Utility Commission will implement guidelines for
    establishing minimum functionality requirements for the advanced
    meter in 2007, and that the Texas Utility Commission will
    provide a mechanism for timely recovery of costs of
    implementation. CenterPoint Houston will evaluate the outcome of
    the limited deployment and the regulatory mechanisms for cost
    recovery to assess what further expansions, if any, will be made
    later in 2007 and beyond.

Competition

There are no other electric transmission and distribution
    utilities in CenterPoint Houston’s service area. In order
    for another provider of transmission and distribution services
    to provide such services in CenterPoint Houston’s
    territory, it would be required to obtain a certificate of
    convenience and necessity from the Texas Utility Commission and,
    depending on the location of the facilities, may also be
    required to obtain franchises from one or



more municipalities. We know of no other party intending to
    enter this business in CenterPoint Houston’s service area
    at this time.

Seasonality

A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is
    derived from rates that it collects from each retail electric
    provider based on the amount of electricity it distributes on
    behalf of such retail electric provider. Thus, CenterPoint
    Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to
    seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity
    usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer months.

Properties

All of CenterPoint Houston’s properties are located in
    Texas. Its properties consist primarily of high voltage electric
    transmission lines and poles, distribution lines, substations,
    service wires and meters. Most of CenterPoint Houston’s
    transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over
    lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways
    and streets as permitted by law.

All real and tangible properties of CenterPoint Houston, subject
    to certain exclusions, are currently subject to:

•

the lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) dated
    November 1, 1944, as supplemented; and

•

the lien of a General Mortgage (the General Mortgage) dated
    October 10, 2002, as supplemented, which is junior to the
    lien of the Mortgage.

As of December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Houston had
    outstanding $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
    general mortgage bonds under the General Mortgage, including
    approximately $527 million held in trust to secure
    pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is
    obligated and approximately $229 million held in trust to
    secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is
    obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding
    approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of
    first mortgage bonds under the Mortgage, including approximately
    $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution
    control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated.
    CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds
    on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash
    deposited with the trustee. Approximately $2.2 billion of
    additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in
    the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and
    70% of property additions as of December 31, 2006. However,
    CenterPoint Houston is contractually prohibited, subject to
    certain exceptions, from issuing additional first mortgage bonds.

Electric Lines — Overhead.

As of
    December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Houston owned 27,253 pole
    miles of overhead distribution lines and 3,603 circuit miles of
    overhead transmission lines, including 442 circuit miles
    operated at 69,000 volts, 2,084 circuit miles operated at
    138,000 volts and 1,077 circuit miles operated at 345,000 volts.

Electric Lines — Underground.

As of
    December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Houston owned 17,904 circuit
    miles of underground distribution lines and 28.4 circuit miles
    of underground transmission lines, including 4.5 circuit miles
    operated at 69,000 volts and 23.9 circuit miles operated at
    138,000 volts.

Substations.

As of December 31, 2006,
    CenterPoint Houston owned 226 major substation sites having
    total installed rated transformer capacity of 50,647 megavolt
    amperes.

Service Centers.

CenterPoint Houston operates
    14 regional service centers located on a total of 304 acres
    of land. These service centers consist of office buildings,
    warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business
    of transmitting and distributing electricity.

Franchises

CenterPoint Houston holds non-exclusive franchises from the
    incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In
    exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises give
    CenterPoint Houston the right to use the streets and public
    rights-of way of these municipalities to construct, operate and
    maintain its transmission and distribution



system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery
    business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The
    terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates,
    typically range from 30 to 50 years.

In June 2005, CenterPoint Houston accepted an ordinance granting
    it a new

30-year

franchise to use the public

rights-of-way

to conduct its business in the City of Houston (New Houston
    Franchise Ordinance). The New Houston Franchise Ordinance took
    effect on July 1, 2005, and replaced the prior electricity
    franchise ordinance, which had been in effect since 1957. The
    New Houston Franchise Ordinance clarifies certain operational
    obligations of CenterPoint Houston and the City of Houston and
    provides for streamlined payment and audit procedures and a
    two-year statute of limitations on claims for underpayment or
    overpayment under the ordinance. Under the prior electricity
    franchise ordinance, CenterPoint Houston paid annual franchise
    fees of $76.6 million to the City of Houston for the year
    ended December 31, 2004. For the twelve-month period ended
    June 30, 2006, the annual franchise fee under the New
    Houston Franchise Ordinance included a base amount of
    $88.1 million and an additional payment of
    $8.5 million. The base amount and the additional amount
    will be adjusted annually based on the increase, if any, in

kilowatt-hours

(kWh) delivered by CenterPoint Houston within the City of
    Houston. Pursuant to the New Houston Franchise Ordinance, the
    annual franchise fee will be reduced prospectively to reflect
    any portion of the annual franchise fee that is not included in
    CenterPoint Houston’s base rates in any subsequent rate
    case.

In connection with its most recent rate case and the settlement
    discussions related to that case, CenterPoint Houston offered to
    all of the cities in its service area an opportunity to adopt a
    new form of franchise (Settlement Franchise) containing terms
    similar to those in the New Houston Franchise Ordinance. This
    early renewal effort used a non-negotiable form of franchise
    and, except as necessary to comply with city charters, offered
    to all cities substantially equivalent terms and a single,
    simplified method of calculating and paying franchise fees. The
    Settlement Franchise was offered regardless of when any existing
    franchise was scheduled to expire. Of the 92 cities other
    than Houston in CenterPoint Houston’s service area, 59 have
    passed the Settlement Franchise. On December 31, 2006,
    CenterPoint Houston terminated its early renewal offer and will
    pursue new franchises with the remaining cities as their
    franchises near expiration.

Natural
    Gas Distribution

CERC Corp.’s natural gas distribution business (Gas
    Operations) engages in regulated intrastate natural gas sales
    to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately
    3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial
    customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
    Oklahoma and Texas. The largest metropolitan areas served in
    each state by Gas Operations are Houston, Texas; Minneapolis,
    Minnesota; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Biloxi,
    Mississippi; and Lawton, Oklahoma. In 2006, approximately 40% of
    Gas Operations’ total throughput was attributable to
    residential customers and approximately 60% was attributable to
    commercial and industrial customers.

Gas Operations also provides unregulated services consisting of
    heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and
    appliance repair, and sales of HVAC, hearth and water heating
    equipment in Minnesota.

The demand for intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas
    transportation for, residential, commercial and industrial
    customers is seasonal. In 2006, approximately 68% of the total
    throughput of Gas Operations’ business occurred in the
    first and fourth quarters. These patterns reflect the higher
    demand for natural gas for heating purposes during those periods.

Supply and Transportation.

In 2006, Gas
    Operations purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply
    pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few
    months to four years. Major suppliers in 2006 included BP Canada
    Energy Marketing Corp. (23.3% of supply volumes), HPL Marketing
    (14.6%), Kinder Morgan (11.4%), Tenaska Marketing Ventures
    (5.1%) and ConocoPhillips Company (4.7%). Numerous other
    suppliers provided the remaining 40.9% of Gas Operations’
    natural gas supply requirements. Gas Operations transports its
    natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate
    pipelines, including those owned by our other subsidiaries,
    under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions,
    varying from one to sixteen years. Gas Operations anticipates
    that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be
    renewed prior to their expiration.



We actively engage in commodity price stabilization pursuant to
    annual gas supply plans filed with each of our state regulatory
    authorities. These price stabilization activities include
    contractually establishing fixed prices with our physical gas
    suppliers and utilizing financial derivative instruments to
    achieve a variety of pricing structures (e.g., fixed price,
    costless collars, and caps). Our gas supply plans generally call
    for

25-50%

of winter supplies to be hedged in some fashion.

Generally, the regulations of the states in which Gas Operations
    operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural
    gas, including gains and losses on financial derivatives
    associated with the index-priced physical supply, to its
    customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its
    tariffs.  Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas
    adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from
    monthly to semi-annually, using estimated gas costs. The changes
    in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by
    the applicable regulatory bodies.

Gas Operations uses various third-party storage services or
    owned natural gas storage facilities to meet

peak-day

requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to
    changes in weather and may also supplement contracted supplies
    and storage from time to time with stored liquefied natural gas
    and propane-air plant production.

Gas Operations owns and operates an underground storage facility
    with a capacity of 7.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf). It has a
    working capacity of 2.1 Bcf available for use during a
    normal heating season and a maximum daily withdrawal rate of
    50 million cubic feet (MMcf). It also owns nine propane-air
    plants with a total capacity of 192 MMcf per day and

on-site

storage facilities for 12 million gallons of propane
    (1.0 Bcf gas equivalent). It owns liquefied natural gas
    plant facilities with a 12 million-gallon liquefied natural
    gas storage tank (1.0 Bcf gas equivalent) and a send-out
    capability of 72 MMcf per day.

On an ongoing basis, Gas Operations enters into contracts to
    provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its
    customer requirements. However, it is possible for limited
    service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather
    conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a
    result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become
    unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in
    response to temporary supply constraints or other factors.

Assets

As of December 31, 2006, Gas Operations owned approximately
    66,000 linear miles of natural gas distribution mains, varying
    in size from one-half inch to 24 inches in diameter.
    Generally, in each of the cities, towns and rural areas served
    by Gas Operations, it owns the underground gas mains and service
    lines, metering and regulating equipment located on
    customers’ premises and the district regulating equipment
    necessary for pressure maintenance. With a few exceptions, the
    measuring stations at which Gas Operations receives gas are
    owned, operated and maintained by others, and its distribution
    facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment. These
    facilities, including odorizing equipment, are usually located
    on the land owned by suppliers.

Competition

Gas Operations competes primarily with alternate energy sources
    such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas,
    intrastate pipelines, other gas distributors and marketers also
    compete directly for gas sales to

end-users.

In addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting
    interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these
    pipelines may be able to bypass Gas Operations’ facilities
    and market and sell

and/or

transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial
    customers.

Competitive
    Natural Gas Sales and Services

CERC offers variable and fixed-priced physical natural gas
    supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and
    electric and gas utilities through two subsidiaries, CenterPoint
    Energy Intrastate Pipeline, Inc. (CEIP) and CenterPoint Energy
    Services, Inc. (CES).

In 2006, CES marketed approximately 555 Bcf of natural gas,
    transportation and related energy services to nearly 7,000
    customers (including approximately 36 Bcf to affiliates).
    CES customers vary in size from small



commercial customers to large utility companies in the central
    and eastern regions of the United States, and are served from
    offices located in Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota,
    Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The business has
    three operational functions: wholesale, retail and intrastate
    pipelines, which are further described below.

Wholesale Operations.

CES offers a portfolio
    of physical delivery services and financial products designed to
    meet wholesale customers’ supply and price risk management
    needs. These customers are served directly through interconnects
    with various inter- and intra-state pipeline companies, and
    include gas utilities, large industrial customers and electric
    generation customers.

Retail Operations.

CES offers a variety of
    natural gas management services to smaller commercial and
    industrial customers, municipalities, educational institutions
    and hospitals, whose facilities are located downstream of
    natural gas distribution utility city gate stations. These
    services include load forecasting, supply acquisition, daily
    swing volume management, invoice consolidation, storage asset
    management, firm and interruptible transportation administration
    and forward price management. CES manages transportation
    contracts and energy supply for retail customers in ten states.

Intrastate Pipeline Operations.

CEIP provides
    bundled and unbundled merchant and transportation services to
    shippers and end-users.

CES currently transports natural gas on over 30 interstate and
    intrastate pipelines within states located throughout the
    central and eastern United States. CES maintains a portfolio of
    natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation and storage
    agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its
    customers. CES aggregates supply from various producing regions
    and offers contracts to buy natural gas with terms ranging from
    one month to over five years. In addition, CES actively
    participates in the spot natural gas markets in an effort to
    balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations.
    Natural gas supply and transportation capabilities are leveraged
    through contracts for ancillary services including physical
    storage and other balancing arrangements.

As described above, CES offers its customers a variety of load
    following services. In providing these services, CES uses its
    customers’ purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its
    own supply purchases, storage and transportation services to
    serve customers’ natural gas requirements. As a result of
    the variance between this forecast activity and the actual
    monthly activity, CES will either have too much supply or too
    little supply relative to its customers’ purchase
    commitments. These supply imbalances arise each month as
    customers’ natural gas requirements are scheduled and
    corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by CES for
    delivery to those customers. CES’ processes and risk
    control environment are designed to measure and value imbalances
    on a real-time basis to ensure that CES’ exposure to
    commodity price risk is kept to a minimum. The value assigned to
    these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the
    aggregate Value at Risk (VaR). In 2006, CES’ VaR averaged
    $1.6 million with a high of $2.7 million.

The CenterPoint Energy risk control policy, governed by our Risk
    Oversight Committee, defines authorized and prohibited trading
    instruments and trading limits. CES is a physical marketer of
    natural gas and uses a variety of tools, including pipeline and
    storage capacity, financial instruments and physical commodity
    purchase contracts to support its sales. The CES business
    optimizes its use of these various tools to minimize its supply
    costs and does not engage in proprietary or speculative
    commodity trading. The VaR limits within which CES operates are
    consistent with its operational objective of matching its
    aggregate sales obligations (including the swing associated with
    load following services) with its supply portfolio in a manner
    that minimizes its total cost of supply.

Assets

CEIP owns and operates approximately 231 miles of
    intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas and holds storage
    facilities in Texas under long-term leases.

Competition

CES competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas
    marketers including the marketing divisions of natural gas
    producers and utilities. In addition, CES competes with
    intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market
    areas.



Interstate
    Pipelines

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, we are reporting our
    interstate pipelines and field services businesses as two
    separate business segments. These business segments were
    previously aggregated and reported as the Pipelines and Field
    Services business segment. CERC’s pipelines business
    operates:

•

two interstate natural gas pipelines; and

•

gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois,
    Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.

CERC’s interstate pipeline operations are primarily
    conducted by two wholly owned subsidiaries that provide gas
    transportation and storage services primarily to industrial
    customers and local distribution companies:

•

CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT) is an
    interstate pipeline that provides natural gas transportation,
    natural gas storage and pipeline services to customers
    principally in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas; and

•

CenterPoint Energy-Mississippi River Transmission Corporation
    (MRT) is an interstate pipeline that provides natural gas
    transportation, natural gas storage and pipeline services to
    customers principally in Arkansas and Missouri.

The rates charged by CEGT and MRT for interstate transportation
    and storage services are regulated by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC). Our interstate pipelines business
    operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural
    gas, the available supply and relative price of natural gas in
    the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and
    general economic conditions.

In 2006, approximately 26% of CEGT and MRT’s total
    operating revenue was attributable to services provided to Gas
    Operations and approximately 11% was attributable to services
    provided to Laclede Gas Company (Laclede), an unaffiliated
    distribution company that provides natural gas utility service
    to the greater St. Louis metropolitan area in Illinois and
    Missouri. Services to Gas Operations and Laclede are provided
    under several long-term firm storage and transportation
    agreements. Since October 31, 2006, MRT’s contract
    with Laclede has been terminable upon one year’s prior
    notice. MRT has not received a termination notice and is
    currently negotiating a long-term contract with Laclede.
    Agreements for firm transportation, “no notice”
    transportation service and storage service in certain of Gas
    Operations’ service areas (Arkansas, Louisiana and
    Oklahoma) expire in 2012.

Carthage to Perryville.

In October 2005, CEGT
    signed a

10-year

firm
    transportation agreement with XTO Energy (XTO) to transport
    600 MMcf per day of natural gas from Carthage, Texas to
    CEGT’s Perryville hub in Northeast Louisiana. To
    accommodate this transaction, CEGT filed a certificate
    application with the FERC in March 2006 to build a

172-mile,

42-inch

diameter pipeline and related compression facilities. The
    capacity of the pipeline under this filing will be 1.25 Bcf
    per day. CEGT has signed firm contracts for the full capacity of
    the pipeline.

In October 2006, the FERC issued CEGT’s certificate to
    construct, own and operate the pipeline and compression
    facilities. CEGT has begun construction of the facilities and
    expects to place the facilities in service in the second quarter
    of 2007 at a cost of approximately $500 million.

Based on interest expressed during an open season held in 2006,
    and subject to FERC approval, CEGT may expand capacity of the
    pipeline to 1.5 Bcf per day, which would bring the total
    estimated capital cost of the project to approximately
    $550 million. In September 2006, CEGT filed for approval to
    increase the maximum allowable operating pressure with the U.S.
    Department of Transportation (DOT). In December 2006, CEGT filed
    for the necessary certificate to expand capacity of the pipeline
    with the FERC. CEGT expects to receive the approvals in the
    third quarter of 2007.

During the four-year period subsequent to the in-service date of
    the pipeline, XTO can request, and subject to mutual
    negotiations that meet specific financial parameters and to FERC
    approval, CEGT would construct a

67-mile

extension from CEGT’s Perryville hub to an interconnect
    with Texas Eastern Gas Transmission at Union Church, Mississippi.



Southeast Supply Header.

In June 2006,
    CenterPoint Energy Southeast Pipelines Holding, L.L.C., a wholly
    owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. and a subsidiary of Spectra
    Energy Corp. (Spectra) formed a joint venture (Southeast Supply
    Header or SESH) to construct, own and operate a

270-mile

pipeline that will extend from CEGT’s Perryville hub in
    northeast Louisiana to Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is
    50 percent owned by an affiliate of Spectra. In August
    2006, the joint venture signed an agreement with Florida
    Power & Light Company (FPL) for firm transportation
    services, which subscribed approximately half of the planned
    1 Bcf per day capacity of the pipeline. FPL’s
    commitment was contingent on the approval of the FPL contract by
    the Florida Public Service Commission, which was received in
    December 2006. Subject to the joint venture receiving a
    certificate from the FERC to construct, own and operate the
    pipeline, subsidiaries of Spectra and CERC Corp. have committed
    to build the pipeline. In December 2006, the joint venture
    signed agreements with affiliates of Progress Energy Florida,
    Southern Company, Tampa Electric Company, and EOG Resources,
    Inc. bringing the total subscribed capacity to 945 MMcf per
    day. Additionally, SESH and Southern Natural Gas (SNG) have
    executed a definitive agreement that provides for SNG to jointly
    own the first 115 miles of the pipeline. Under the
    agreement, SNG will own an undivided interest in the portion of
    the pipeline from Perryville, Louisiana to an interconnect with
    SNG in Mississippi. The pipe diameter will be increased from
    36 inches to 42 inches, thereby increasing the initial
    capacity of 1 Bcf per day by 140 MMcf per day to
    accommodate SNG. SESH will own assets providing approximately
    1 Bcf per day of capacity as initially planned and will
    maintain economic expansion opportunities in the future. SNG
    will own assets providing 140 MMcf per day of capacity, and
    the agreement provides for a future compression expansion that
    could increase the capacity up to 500 MMcf per day. An
    application to construct, own and operate the pipeline was filed
    with the FERC in December 2006. Subject to receipt of FERC
    authorization and construction in accordance with planned
    schedule, we currently expect an in service date in the summer
    of 2008. The total cost of the combined project is estimated to
    be $800 to $900 million with SESH’s net costs of $700 to
    $800 million after SNG’s contribution.

Proposed Mid-continent Crossing.

In June 2006,
    CEGT and Spectra signed a memorandum of understanding to explore
    the potential development of a new natural gas pipeline to bring
    gas from areas in the Mid-continent region to pipelines serving
    the Northeast and Southeast markets (MCX). In January 2007, CEGT
    and Spectra announced that market and economic conditions did
    not support the construction of the proposed pipeline. CEGT and
    Spectra may continue to independently evaluate opportunities for
    building infrastructure to transport mid-continent natural gas,
    including projects in the vicinity of the proposed MCX.

Assets

Our interstate pipelines business currently owns and operates
    approximately 7,900 miles of natural gas transmission lines
    primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri,
    Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas
    storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of
    approximately 1.2 Bcf per day and a combined working gas
    capacity of approximately 59.0 Bcf. It also owns a 10%
    interest in the Bistineau storage facility located in Bienville
    Parish, Louisiana, with the remaining interest owned and
    operated by Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP. This facility has a
    total working gas capacity of 85.7 Bcf and approximately
    1.1 Bcf per day of deliverability. Storage capacity in the
    Bistineau facility is 8 Bcf of working gas with
    100 MMcf per day of deliverability. Most storage operations
    are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma.

Competition

Our interstate pipelines business competes with other interstate
    and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of
    natural gas. The principal elements of competition among
    pipelines are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and
    reliability of service. Our interstate pipelines business
    competes indirectly with other forms of energy available to our
    customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The
    primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability
    of energy and pipeline capacity, the level of business activity,
    conservation and governmental regulations, the capability to
    convert to alternative fuels, and other factors, including
    weather, affect the demand for natural gas in areas we serve and
    the level of competition for transportation and storage services.



Field
    Services

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, we are reporting our
    interstate pipelines and field services businesses as two
    separate business segments. These business segments were
    previously aggregated and reported as the Pipelines and Field
    Services business segment. CERC’s field services business
    operates gas gathering, treating, and processing facilities and
    also provides operating and technical services and remote data
    monitoring and communication services.

CERC’s field services operations are conducted by a wholly
    owned subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, Inc.
    (CEFS). CEFS provides natural gas gathering and processing
    services for certain natural gas fields in the Mid-continent
    region of the United States that interconnect with CEGT’s
    and MRT’s pipelines, as well as other interstate and
    intrastate pipelines. CEFS, either directly or through its 50%
    interest in the Waskom Joint Venture, processes in excess of
    240 MMcf per day of natural gas along its gathering system.
    CEFS, through its ServiceStar operating division, provides
    remote data monitoring and communications services to affiliates
    and third parties. The ServiceStar operating division currently
    provides monitoring activities at 11,080 locations across
    Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana,
    Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.

Our field services business operations may be affected by
    changes in the demand for natural gas, the available supply and
    relative price of natural gas in the Mid-continent and Gulf
    Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions.

Assets

Our field services business owns and operates approximately
    3,700 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants
    that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately
    150 separate systems located in major producing fields in
    Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.

Competition

Our field services business competes with other companies in the
    natural gas gathering, treating, and processing business. The
    principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service
    and reliability of services. Our field services business
    competes indirectly with other forms of energy available to our
    customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The
    primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability
    of energy and pipeline capacity, the level of business activity,
    conservation and governmental regulations, the capability to
    convert to alternative fuels, and other factors, including
    weather, affect the demand for natural gas in areas we serve and
    the level of competition for gathering, treating, and processing
    services. In addition, competition for our gathering operations
    is impacted by commodity pricing levels because of their
    influence on the level of drilling activity.

Other
    Operations

Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings
    and other real estate used in our business operations and other
    corporate operations that support all of our business operations.

Discontinued
    Operations

In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority
    owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco LLC. In December
    2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation
    assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC
    for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas
    Genco, whose principal remaining asset was its ownership
    interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed
    $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the
    transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of
    Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us
    of $700 million, was completed in April 2005.

We recorded an after-tax loss of $133 million and
    $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
    2005, respectively, related to the operations of Texas Genco.
    The consolidated financial statements report these operations
    for all periods presented as discontinued operations in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”



Financial
    Information About Segments

For financial information about our segments, see Note 14
    to our consolidated financial statements, which note is
    incorporated herein by reference.

REGULATION

We are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local
    governmental agencies, including the regulations described below.

Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission

The FERC has jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and the
    Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, to regulate the
    transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural
    gas sales for resale in intrastate commerce that are not first
    sales. The FERC regulates, among other things, the construction
    of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation
    and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the
    extension, expansion or abandonment of these facilities. The
    rates charged by interstate pipelines for interstate
    transportation and storage services are also regulated by the
    FERC. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) expanded the
    FERC’s authority to prohibit market manipulation in
    connection with FERC-regulated transactions and gave the FERC
    additional authority to impose civil penalties for statutory
    violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders and
    also expanded criminal penalties for such violations.

Our natural gas pipeline subsidiaries may periodically file
    applications with the FERC for changes in their generally
    available maximum rates and charges designed to allow them to
    recover their costs of providing service to customers (to the
    extent allowed by prevailing market conditions), including a
    reasonable rate of return. These rates are normally allowed to
    become effective after a suspension period and, in some cases,
    are subject to refund under applicable law until such time as
    the FERC issues an order on the allowable level of rates.

CenterPoint Houston is not a “public utility” under
    the Federal Power Act and therefore is not generally regulated
    by the FERC, although certain of its transactions are subject to
    limited FERC jurisdiction. The Energy Act conferred new
    jurisdiction and responsibilities on the FERC with respect to
    ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service,
    including transmission owned by CenterPoint Houston and other
    utilities within ERCOT. Under the legislation, the FERC is
    required to designate an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO)
    which will, under FERC oversight, promulgate standards for all
    owners, operators and users of the bulk power system (Electric
    Entities). The ERO and the FERC have authority to impose fines
    and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply
    with the standards. The FERC has designated the North American
    Electric Reliability Council (NERC) as the ERO. Under the Energy
    Act the ERO may delegate authority to regional entities.
    Currently ERCOT is seeking FERC approval for an ERCOT division
    to be designated as the regional entity for the ERCOT region.
    The ERO currently is developing standards and the other aspects
    of the regulatory framework under the Energy Act. CenterPoint
    Houston does not anticipate that the transmission standards will
    have a material adverse impact on its operations. To the extent
    that CenterPoint Houston is required to make additional
    expenditures to comply with the ERO’s transmission
    standards, it is anticipated that CenterPoint Houston will seek
    to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are
    imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT for
    electric transmission provided.

Prior to repeal of the 1935 Act, effective February 8,
    2006, we were a registered public utility holding company under
    the 1935 Act, and we and our subsidiaries were subject to a
    comprehensive regulatory scheme imposed by the SEC under that
    Act. Although the SEC did not regulate rates and charges under
    the 1935 Act, it did regulate the structure, financing, lines of
    business and internal transactions of public utility holding
    companies and their system companies.

The Energy Act repealed the 1935 Act , and since that date, we
    and our subsidiaries have no longer been subject to restrictions
    imposed under the 1935 Act. The Energy Act includes PUHCA 2005
    which grants to the FERC authority to require holding companies
    and their subsidiaries to maintain certain books and records and
    make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory
    authorities in certain circumstances. In December 2005, the FERC
    issued rules implementing PUHCA 2005. Pursuant to those rules,
    in June 2006, we filed with the FERC



the required notification of our status as a public utility
    holding company. In October 2006, the FERC adopted additional
    rules regarding maintenance of books and records by utility
    holding companies and additional reporting and accounting
    requirements for centralized service companies that make
    allocations to public utilities regulated by the FERC under the
    Federal Power Act. Although we provide services to our
    subsidiaries through a service company, our service company is
    not subject to the service company rules.

State and
    Local Regulation

Electric
    Transmission & Distribution

CenterPoint Houston conducts its operations pursuant to a
    certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Texas
    Utility Commission that covers its present service area and
    facilities. The Texas Utility Commission and those
    municipalities that have retained original jurisdiction have the
    authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by
    CenterPoint Houston under cost of service rate regulation.
    CenterPoint Houston holds non-exclusive franchises from the
    incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In
    exchange for payment of fees, these franchises give CenterPoint
    Houston the right to use the streets and public

rights-of-way

of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its
    transmission and distribution system and to use that system to
    conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes
    that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with
    various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to
    50 years. As discussed above under “Our
    Business — Electric Transmission &
    Distribution — Franchises,” a new franchise
    ordinance for the City of Houston franchise was granted in June
    2005 with a term of 30 years and 60 other cities have
    passed new franchise ordinances following a similar,
    standardized form.

All REPs in CenterPoint Houston’s service area pay the same
    rates and other charges for the same transmission and
    distribution services.

CenterPoint Houston’s distribution rates charged to REPs
    for residential customers are based on amounts of energy
    delivered, whereas distribution rates for a majority of
    commercial and industrial customers are based on peak demand.
    Transmission rates charged to other distribution companies are
    based on amounts of energy transmitted under “postage
    stamp” rates that do not vary with the distance the energy
    is being transmitted. All distribution companies in ERCOT pay
    CenterPoint Houston the same rates and other charges for
    transmission services. This regulated delivery charge includes
    the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal
    franchise fees), a system benefit fund fee imposed by the Texas
    electric restructuring law, a nuclear decommissioning charge
    associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear
    generating facility (South Texas Project), transition charges
    associated with securitization of regulatory assets and
    securitization of stranded costs, a competition transition
    charge for collection of the

true-up

balance not securitized and a rate case expense charge.

CenterPoint
    Houston Rate Case.

In December 2005, the Texas Utility Commission ordered the
    commencement of a rate proceeding concerning the reasonableness
    of CenterPoint Houston’s existing rates for transmission
    and distribution service and required CenterPoint Houston to
    make a filing by April 15, 2006 to justify or change those
    rates. In April 2006, CenterPoint Houston filed cost data and
    other information that supported the rates then in effect.

In July 2006, CenterPoint Houston entered into a settlement
    agreement with the parties to the proceeding that resolved the
    issues raised in this matter. CenterPoint Houston filed a
    Stipulation and Agreement (Settlement Agreement) with the Texas
    Utility Commission in August 2006 to seek approval of the
    Settlement Agreement. In September 2006, the Texas Utility
    Commission issued its final order approving the Settlement
    Agreement. Revised base rates and other revised tariffs became
    effective in October 2006.

Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, CenterPoint
    Houston’s base rate revenues were reduced by a net of
    approximately $58 million per year. Also, CenterPoint
    Houston agreed to increase its energy efficiency expenditures by
    an additional $10 million per year over the
    $13 million then included in rates. The expenditures will
    be made to benefit both residential and commercial customers.
    CenterPoint Houston also will fund $10 million per year for
    programs providing financial assistance to qualified low-income
    customers in its service territory.



The Settlement Agreement provides that until June 30, 2010
    CenterPoint Houston will not seek to increase its base rates and
    the other parties will not petition to decrease those rates.
    This rate freeze is subject to adjustments for changes related
    to certain transmission costs, implementation of the Texas
    Utility Commission’s recently-adopted change to its CTC
    rule and certain other changes. The rate freeze does not apply
    to changes required to reflect the result of currently pending
    appeals of the

True-Up

Order, the pending appeal of the Texas Utility Commission’s
    order regarding CenterPoint Houston’s final fuel
    reconciliation, the appeal of the order implementing CenterPoint
    Houston’s CTC or the implementation of transition charges
    associated with current and future securitizations. In addition,
    CenterPoint Houston is not required to file annual earnings
    reports for the calendar years 2006 through 2008, but is
    required to file an earnings report for 2009 no later than
    March 1, 2010. CenterPoint Houston must make a new base
    rate filing not later than June 30, 2010, based on a test
    year ended December 31, 2009, unless the Staff and certain
    cities with original jurisdiction notify CenterPoint Houston
    that such a filing is unnecessary.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, in October 2006
    CenterPoint Houston began amortizing expenditures of
    approximately $28 million related to Hurricane Rita over a
    seven-year period and regulatory expenses of approximately
    $7 million over a four-year period. Pursuant to the
    Settlement Agreement, the Texas Utility Commission determined
    that franchise fees payable by CenterPoint Houston under new
    franchise agreements with the City of Houston and certain other
    municipalities in CenterPoint Houston’s service area are
    deemed reasonable and necessary, along with the revised base
    rates.

The Settlement Agreement also resolved all issues that could be
    raised in the Texas Utility Commission’s proceeding to
    review its decision in CenterPoint Houston’s 2001 UCOS case
    discussed above under “Our Business — Electric
    Transmission & Distribution — Remand of 2001
    Unbundled Cost of Service (UCOS) Order.”

These and other significant matters currently affecting our
    financial condition are further discussed in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Executive
    Summary — Significant Events in 2006” in
    Item 7 of this report.

Natural
    Gas Distribution

In almost all communities in which Gas Operations provides
    natural gas distribution services, it operates under franchises,
    certificates or licenses obtained from state and local
    authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various
    expiration dates, typically range from 10 to 30 years,
    although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual. Gas Operations
    expects to be able to renew expiring franchises. In most cases,
    franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not
    exclusive.

Substantially all of Gas Operations is subject to traditional

cost-of-service

regulation at rates regulated by the relevant state public
    utility commissions and, in Texas, by the Railroad Commission of
    Texas (Railroad Commission) and those municipalities Gas
    Operations serves that have retained original jurisdiction.

Arkansas.

In January 2007, Gas Operations
    filed an application with the Arkansas Public Service Commission
    (APSC) to change its natural gas distribution rates. This filing
    seeks approval to change the base rate portion of a
    customer’s natural gas bill, which makes up about
    30 percent of the total bill and covers the cost of
    distributing natural gas. The filing does not apply to the Gas
    Supply Rate (GSR), which makes up the remaining approximately
    70 percent of the bill. Through the GSR, Gas Operations
    passes through to its customers the actual cost it pays for the
    natural gas it purchases for use by its customers without any

mark-up.

In
    a separate filing in January 2007, Gas Operations reduced the
    GSR by about 9 percent. The APSC approved this GSR filing
    in January 2007.

The filing seeks approval by the APSC of new rates that would go
    into effect later this year and would generate approximately
    $51 million in additional revenue on an annual basis. The
    effect on individual monthly bills would vary depending on
    natural gas use and customer class. As part of the base rate
    filing, we are also proposing a mechanism that, if approved,
    would help stabilize revenues, eliminate the potential conflict
    between our efforts to earn a reasonable return on invested
    capital while promoting energy efficiency initiatives, and
    minimize the need for future rate cases. As part of the revenue
    stabilization mechanism, we proposed to reduce the requested
    return on equity by 35 basis points which would reduce the
    base rate increase by $1 million. The mechanism would be in
    place through December 31, 2010.



In Arkansas, the APSC in December 2006 adopted rules governing
    affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in
    Arkansas. The rules treat as affiliate transactions all
    transactions between CERC’s Arkansas utility operations and
    other divisions of CERC, as well as transactions between the
    Arkansas utility operations and affiliates of CERC. All such
    affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an
    asymmetrical pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility
    operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of
    providing goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility
    operations and the market value of those goods or services.
    Additionally, the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted
    to participate in any financing other than to finance retail
    utility operations in Arkansas, which would preclude
    continuation of existing financing arrangements in which CERC
    finances its divisions and subsidiaries, including its Arkansas
    utility operations.

Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other
    gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought
    reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the
    APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the
    rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If
    the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration,
    CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the
    rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and
    financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in
    compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may
    seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules
    ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would
    need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or
    would be required to make significant modifications to existing
    practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of
    assets to subsidiaries.

If this regulatory framework becomes effective, it could have
    adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate and provide
    cost-effective utility service.

Texas.

In September 2006, Gas Operations filed
    Statements of Intent (SOI) with 47 cities in its Texas
    coast service territory to increase miscellaneous service
    charges and to allow recovery of the costs of financial hedging
    transactions through its purchased gas cost adjustment. In
    November 2006, these changes became effective as all
    47 cities either approved the filings or took no action,
    thereby allowing rates to go into effect by operation of law. In
    December 2006, Gas Operations filed a SOI with the Railroad
    Commission seeking to implement such changes in the environs of
    the Texas coast service territory. Gas Operations’ filing
    has been suspended to allow for discovery and pre-hearing
    conferences, and a final determination is expected in the second
    quarter of 2007.

Minnesota.

At September 30, 2006, Gas
    Operations had recorded approximately $45 million as a
    regulatory asset related to prior years’ unrecovered
    purchased gas costs in its Minnesota service territory. Of the
    total, approximately $24 million related to the period from
    July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006, and approximately
    $21 million related to the period from July 1, 2000
    through June 30, 2004. The amounts related to periods prior
    to July 1, 2004 arose as a result of revisions to the
    calculation of unrecovered purchased gas costs previously
    approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC).
    Recovery of this regulatory asset was dependent upon obtaining a
    waiver from the MPUC rules. In November 2006, the MPUC
    considered the request for variance and voted to deny the
    waiver. Accordingly, we charged $21 million before income
    taxes to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 and reduced the
    regulatory asset by an equal amount. In February 2007, the MPUC
    denied reconsideration. Although no prediction can be made as to
    the ultimate outcome of this matter, we expect to appeal the
    MPUC’s decision which precludes recovery of the cost of
    this gas, which was delivered to our customers and for which we
    have never been paid.

In November 2005, we filed a request with the MPUC to increase
    annual rates by approximately $41 million. In December
    2005, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase of
    approximately $35 million that was implemented
    January 1, 2006. Any excess of amounts collected under the
    interim rates over the amounts approved in final rates is
    subject to refund to customers. In October 2006, the MPUC
    considered the request and indicated that it would grant a rate
    increase of approximately $21 million. In addition, the
    MPUC approved a $5 million affordability program to assist
    low-income customers, the actual cost of which will be recovered
    in rates in addition to the $21 million rate increase.
    Although the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office (OAG)
    requested reconsideration of certain parts of the MPUC’s
    decision, in January 2007, the MPUC voted to deny
    reconsideration and a final order was issued in January 2007.
    The proportional share of the excess of the amounts collected in
    interim rates over the amount allowed by the final order will be
    refunded to customers after implementation of final



rates. We expect final rates to be implemented no later than May
    2007. As of December 31, 2006, approximately
    $12 million has been accrued for the refund.

In December 2004, the MPUC opened an investigation to determine
    whether our practices regarding restoring natural gas service
    during the period between October 15 and April 15 (Cold Weather
    Period) were in compliance with the MPUC’s Cold Weather
    Rule (CWR), which governs disconnection and reconnection of
    customers during the Cold Weather Period. In June 2005, the OAG
    issued its report alleging we had violated the CWR and
    recommended a $5 million penalty. In addition, in June
    2005, CERC Corp. was named in a suit filed in the
    United States District Court, District of Minnesota on
    behalf of a purported class of customers who allege that our
    conduct under the CWR was in violation of the law. In August
    2006, the court gave final approval to a $13.5 million
    settlement which resolved all but one small claim against us
    which have or could have been asserted by residential natural
    gas customers in the CWR class action. The agreement was also
    approved by the MPUC, resolving the claims made by the OAG. The
    anticipated costs of this settlement were accrued during the
    fourth quarter of 2005.

Department
    of Transportation

In December 2002, Congress enacted the Pipeline Safety
    Improvement Act of 2002 (2002 Act). This legislation applies to
    our interstate pipelines as well as our intrastate pipeline and
    local distribution companies. The legislation imposes several
    requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and integrity.
    It requires pipeline and distribution companies to assess the
    integrity of their pipeline transmission facilities in areas of
    high population concentration or High Consequence Areas (HCA).
    The legislation further requires companies to perform
    remediation activities in accordance with the requirements of
    the legislation over a

10-year

period.

In December 2006, Congress enacted the Pipeline Inspection,
    Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, which
    reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act, proposed
    enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to
    pipelines, established increased federal enforcement of one-call
    excavation programs, and established a new program for review of
    pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections. In
    addition, beginning in October 2005, the Pipeline and Hazardous
    Materials Safety Administration of the DOT commenced a
    rulemaking proceeding to develop rules that would better
    distinguish onshore gathering lines from production facilities
    and transmission lines, and to develop safety requirements
    better tailored to gathering line risks. In March 2006, the DOT
    revised its regulations to define more clearly the categories of
    gathering facilities subject to DOT regulation, establish new
    safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas, revise
    the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of
    gathering lines in non-rural areas, and adopt new compliance
    deadlines.

We anticipate that compliance with these regulations by our
    interstate and intrastate pipelines and our natural gas
    distribution companies will require increases in both capital
    and operating costs. The level of expenditures required to
    comply with these regulations will be dependent on several
    factors, including the age of the facility, the pressures at
    which the facility operates and the number of facilities deemed
    to be located in areas designated as HCA. Based on our
    interpretation of the rules and preliminary technical reviews,
    we believe compliance will require average annual expenditures
    of approximately $15 to $20 million during the initial

10-year

period.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and
    regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As
    an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, gas gathering and
    processing systems, and electric transmission and distribution
    systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the
    federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can
    restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

•

restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;

•

limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive
    areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by
    endangered species;

•

requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions
    caused by our operations, or attributable to former
    operations; and



•

enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance
    with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and
    regulations.

In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend
    substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time
    to:

•

construct or acquire new equipment;

•

acquire permits for facility operations;

•

modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and

•

clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and
    management facilities and other locations and facilities.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a
    variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement
    measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the
    imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders
    enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes
    impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to
    clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been
    disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for
    neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims
    for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the
    release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the
    environment.

The trend in environmental regulation is to place more
    restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the
    environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount
    or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or
    remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different
    from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate
    future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan
    accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental
    laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such
    compliance.

Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations, we
    do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local
    environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position or results of
    operations. In addition, we believe that our current
    environmental remediation activities will not materially
    interrupt or diminish our operational ability. We cannot assure
    you, however, that future events, such as changes in existing
    laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or
    discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur
    significant costs. The following is a discussion of all material
    environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our
    operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance
    with all of these environmental laws and regulations.

Air
    Emissions

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and
    comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and
    regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various
    industrial sources, including our processing plants and
    compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and
    reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require
    that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification
    of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air
    emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions,
    obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various
    emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific
    emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to
    comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary
    penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on
    operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. We may
    be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future
    for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining
    and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air
    emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be
    materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the
    requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us
    than to other similarly situated companies.

Water
    Discharges

Our operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution
    Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water
    Act, and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and
    regulations impose detailed



requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of
    pollutants into waters of the United States. The unpermitted
    discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a
    spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and
    regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of
    dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the
    United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued
    permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants
    from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or
    penalties as well as significant remedial obligations.

Hazardous
    Waste

Our operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes,
    that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state laws, which impose
    detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and
    disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts
    many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from
    classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes
    from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other
    wastes associated with the exploration, development, or
    production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and
    gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under
    state law and the less stringent non-hazardous waste
    requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such
    as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste
    compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The
    transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate
    some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or
    comparable state law requirements.

Liability
    for Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), also known as
    “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose
    liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the
    original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for
    the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such
    classes of persons include the current and past owners or
    operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and
    companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of
    hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills.
    Although petroleum, as well as natural gas, is excluded from
    CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,”
    in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that
    may fall within the definition of a “hazardous
    substance.” CERCLA authorizes the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some cases, third
    parties to take action in response to threats to the public
    health or the environment and to seek to recover from the
    responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. Under
    CERCLA, we could be subject to joint and several liability for
    the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous
    substances have been released, for damages to natural resources,
    and for the costs of certain health studies.

Liability
    for Preexisting Conditions

Hydrocarbon Contamination.

CERC Corp. and
    certain of its subsidiaries are among the defendants in lawsuits
    filed beginning in August 2001 in Caddo Parish and Bossier
    Parish, Louisiana. The suits allege that, at some unspecified
    date prior to 1985, the defendants allowed or caused hydrocarbon
    or chemical contamination of the Wilcox Aquifer, which lies
    beneath property owned or leased by certain of the defendants
    and which is the sole or primary drinking water aquifer in the
    area. The primary source of the contamination is alleged by the
    plaintiffs to be a gas processing facility in Haughton, Bossier
    Parish, Louisiana known as the “Sligo Facility,” which
    was formerly operated by a predecessor in interest of CERC Corp.
    This facility was purportedly used for gathering natural gas
    from surrounding wells, separating liquid hydrocarbons from the
    natural gas for marketing, and transmission of natural gas for
    distribution.

Beginning about 1985, the predecessors of certain CERC Corp.
    defendants engaged in a voluntary remediation of any subsurface
    contamination of the groundwater below the property they owned
    or leased. This work has been done in conjunction with and under
    the direction of the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages for alleged damage
    to the aquifer underlying their property, including the cost of
    restoring their property to its original condition and damages
    for diminution of value of their property. In addition,
    plaintiffs seek damages for trespass, punitive, and exemplary
    damages. The parties have reached an agreement on terms of a
    settlement in principle of this matter. That settlement would
    require approval from the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality of an acceptable remediation plan that could be
    implemented by CERC.



CERC currently is seeking that approval. If the currently agreed
    terms for settlement are ultimately implemented, the Company and
    CERC do not expect the ultimate cost associated with resolving
    this matter to have a material impact on the financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows of either the
    Company or CERC.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.

CERC and its
    predecessors operated manufactured gas plants (MGP) in the past.
    In Minnesota, CERC has completed remediation on two sites, other
    than ongoing monitoring and water treatment. There are five
    remaining sites in CERC’s Minnesota service territory. CERC
    believes that it has no liability with respect to two of these
    sites.

At December 31, 2006, CERC had accrued $14 million for
    remediation of these Minnesota sites. At December 31, 2006,
    the estimated range of possible remediation costs for these
    sites was $4 million to $35 million based on
    remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years. The cost
    estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average
    costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual
    remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to
    be remediated, the participation of other potentially
    responsible parties (PRP), if any, and the remediation methods
    used. CERC has utilized an environmental expense tracker
    mechanism in its rates in Minnesota to recover estimated costs
    in excess of insurance recovery. As of December 31, 2006,
    CERC had collected $13 million from insurance companies and
    rate payers to be used for future environmental remediation.

In addition to the Minnesota sites, the EPA and other regulators
    have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CERC
    or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates. CERC has
    been named as a defendant in two lawsuits, one filed in the
    United States District Court, District of Maine and the other
    filed in the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division,
    under which contribution is sought by private parties for the
    cost to remediate former MGP sites based on the previous
    ownership of such sites by former affiliates of CERC or its
    divisions. CERC has also been identified as a PRP by the State
    of Maine for a site that is the subject of one of the lawsuits.
    In March 2005, the federal district court considering the suit
    for contribution in Florida granted CERC’s motion to
    dismiss on the grounds that CERC was not an “operator”
    of the site as had been alleged. In October 2006, the
    11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district
    court’s dismissal. In June 2006, the federal district court
    in Maine that is considering the other suit ruled that the
    current owner of the site is responsible for site remediation
    but that an additional evidentiary hearing is required to
    determine if other potentially responsible parties, including
    CERC, would have to contribute to that remediation. We are
    investigating details regarding these sites and the range of
    environmental expenditures for potential remediation. However,
    CERC believes it is not liable as a former owner or operator of
    those sites under CERCLA and applicable state statutes, and is
    vigorously contesting those suits and its designation as a PRP.

Mercury Contamination.

Our pipeline and
    distribution operations have in the past employed elemental
    mercury in measuring and regulating equipment. It is possible
    that small amounts of mercury may have been spilled in the
    course of normal maintenance and replacement operations and that
    these spills may have contaminated the immediate area with
    elemental mercury. We have found this type of contamination at
    some sites in the past, and we have conducted remediation at
    these sites. It is possible that other contaminated sites may
    exist and that remediation costs may be incurred for these
    sites. Although the total amount of these costs is not known at
    this time, based on our experience and that of others in the
    natural gas industry to date and on the current regulations
    regarding remediation of these sites, we believe that the costs
    of any remediation of these sites will not be material to our
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos.

Some of our facilities contain or
    have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestos-containing
    materials. We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with
    numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of
    individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some
    of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most
    existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our
    subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those
    received may be asserted in the future. In 2004, we sold our
    generating business, to which most of these claims relate, to
    Texas Genco LLC, which is now known as NRG Texas LP (NRG). Under
    the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the
    generating business from us and our sale of this business to
    Texas Genco LLC, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured
    losses from claims relating to the generating business has been
    assumed by Texas Genco LLC and its successor, but we have agreed
    to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered
    by insurance we maintain, subject to reimbursement of the costs
    of such defense from the purchaser. Although the ultimate
    outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, we



intend to continue vigorously contesting claims that we do not
    consider to have merit and do not expect, based on our
    experience to date, these matters, either individually or in the
    aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Environmental.

From time to time we have
    received notices from regulatory authorities or others regarding
    our status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require
    remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants.
    In addition, we have been named from time to time as a defendant
    in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate
    outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, we do
    not expect, based on our experience to date, these matters,
    either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Fund Collection

Pursuant to regulatory requirements and its tariff, CenterPoint
    Houston, as collection agent, collects from its transmission and
    distribution customers a nuclear decommissioning charge assessed
    with respect to its former 30.8% ownership interest in the South
    Texas Project, which it owned when it was part of an integrated
    electric utility. Amounts collected are transferred to nuclear
    decommissioning trusts maintained by the current owner of that
    interest in the South Texas Project. During 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    $2.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million,
    respectively, was transferred. There are various investment
    restrictions imposed on owners of nuclear generating stations by
    the Texas Utility Commission and the U.S. Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission relating to nuclear decommissioning
    trusts. Pursuant to the provisions of both a separation
    agreement and a final order of the Texas Utility Commission
    relating to the 2005 transfer of ownership to Texas Genco LLC,
    now NRG, CenterPoint Houston and a subsidiary of NRG were, until
    July 1, 2006, jointly administering the decommissioning
    funds through the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Investment
    Committee. On June 9, 2006, the Texas Utility Commission
    approved an application by CenterPoint Houston and an NRG
    subsidiary to name the NRG subsidiary as the sole fund
    administrator. As a result, CenterPoint Houston is no longer
    responsible for administration of decommissioning funds it
    collects as collection agent.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2006, we had 8,623 full-time
    employees. The following table sets forth the number of our

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We are a holding company that conducts all of our business
    operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston
    and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal
    proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in
    Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk
    factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of
    these subsidiaries:

Risk
    Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission &
    Distribution Business

CenterPoint
    Houston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full
    value of its

true-up

components, which could result in the elimination of certain tax
    benefits and could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint
    Houston’s results of operations, financial condition and
    cash flows.

In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its

true-up

application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting
    recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed
    under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004,
    the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order

(True-Up

Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a

true-up

balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included
    interest through August 31, 2004, and providing for
    adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on
    the balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional
    excess mitigation credits returned to customers after
    August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties filed appeals of the

True-Up

Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August
    2005, the court issued its final judgment on the various
    appeals. In its judgment, the court affirmed most aspects of the

True-Up

Order, but reversed two of the Texas Utility Commission’s
    rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoring
    approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the
    $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed
    from CenterPoint Houston’s initial request. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s
    judgment. Oral arguments before the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals were held in January 2007, but a decision is not
    expected for several months. No amounts related to the district
    court’s judgment have been recorded in our consolidated
    financial statements.

Among the issues raised in CenterPoint Houston’s appeal of
    the

True-Up

Order is the Texas Utility Commission’s reduction of
    CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by
    approximately $146 million for the present value of certain
    deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric
    generation assets. Such reduction was considered in our
    recording of an after-tax extraordinary loss of
    $977 million in the last half of 2004. We believe that the
    Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed regulations
    issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in March 2003
    related to those tax benefits. Those proposed regulations would
    have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated
    before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass
    the benefits of Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits
    (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal Income Taxes (EDFIT) back to
    customers. However, in December 2005, the IRS withdrew those
    proposed normalization regulations and issued new proposed
    regulations that do not include the provision allowing a
    retroactive election to pass the tax benefits back to customers.
    In a May 2006 Private Letter Ruling (PLR) issued to a Texas
    utility on facts similar to CenterPoint Houston’s, the IRS,
    without referencing its proposed regulations, ruled that a
    normalization violation would occur if ADITC and EDFIT were
    required to be returned to customers. CenterPoint Houston has
    requested a PLR asking the IRS whether the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s
    stranded cost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT
    would cause a normalization violation. If the IRS determines
    that such reduction would cause a normalization violation with
    respect to the ADITC and the Texas Utility Commission’s
    order relating to such reduction is not reversed or otherwise
    modified, the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to
    CenterPoint Houston’s unamortized ADITC balance as of the
    date that the normalization violation is deemed to have
    occurred. In addition, if a normalization violation with respect
    to EDFIT is deemed to have occurred and the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order relating to such reduction is not
    reversed or otherwise modified, the IRS could deny CenterPoint
    Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation
    benefits beginning in the taxable year that the normalization
    violation is deemed to have occurred. If a normalization
    violation should ultimately be found to exist, it could have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition
    and cash flows. However, we and CenterPoint Houston are
    vigorously pursuing the appeal of this issue and will seek other
    relief from the Texas Utility Commission to avoid a
    normalization violation. The Texas Utility Commission has not
    previously required a company subject to its jurisdiction to
    take action that would result in a normalization violation.



CenterPoint
    Houston’s receivables are concentrated in a small number of
    REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect
    CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and
    results of operations.

CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of
    electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity
    CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. Currently,
    CenterPoint Houston does business with 68 REPs. Adverse economic
    conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or
    financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the
    ability of these retail providers to pay for CenterPoint
    Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such
    payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit
    payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions
    require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort
    if a retail electric provider cannot make timely payments.
    Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI), through its subsidiaries, is
    CenterPoint Houston’s largest customer. Approximately 53%
    of CenterPoint Houston’s $140 million in billed
    receivables from REPs at December 31, 2006 was owed by
    subsidiaries of RRI. Any delay or default in payment could
    adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Rate
    regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or
    deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable
    return and fully recover its costs.

CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain
    municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an
    analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test
    year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to
    charge may not match its expenses at any given time. In this
    connection, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement discussed in
    “Business — Regulation — State and
    Local Regulation — Electric Transmission &
    Distribution — CenterPoint Houston Rate Case” in
    Item 1 of this report, until June 30, 2010,
    CenterPoint Houston is limited in its ability to request rate
    relief. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may
    not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of
    CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston
    to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.

Disruptions
    at power generation facilities owned by third parties could
    interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and
    distribution services.

CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of
    REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation
    facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not
    own or operate any power generation facilities. If power
    generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is
    inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and
    distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be
    adversely affected.

CenterPoint
    Houston’s revenues and results of operations are
    seasonal.

A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is
    derived from rates that it collects from each retail electric
    provider based on the amount of electricity it distributes on
    behalf of such retail electric provider. Thus, CenterPoint
    Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to
    seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity
    usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer months.

Risk
    Factors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive
    Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field
    Services Businesses

Rate
    regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s
    ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its
    costs.

CERC’s rates for its local distribution companies are
    regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions, and
    for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis
    of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus,
    the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its
    expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which
    rates are determined may not always result in rates that will
    produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to
    earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.



CERC’s
    businesses must compete with alternative energy sources, which
    could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its
    interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete
    directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering,
    treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to
    lower prices, either of which could have an adverse impact on
    CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as
    electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate
    pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also
    compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users.
    In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting
    interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these
    pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and
    market, sell

and/or

transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial
    customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed,
    sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have
    an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

CERC’s two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems
    compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and
    gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural
    gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of
    service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also
    compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including
    electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor
    is price. The actions of CERC’s competitors could lead to
    lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

CERC’s
    natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and
    services businesses are subject to fluctuations in natural gas
    pricing levels, which could affect the ability of CERC’s
    suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise
    adversely affect CERC’s liquidity.

CERC is subject to risk associated with increases in the price
    of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect
    CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers
    and, on the regulated side, could create the potential for
    uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels
    built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained
    period of high natural gas prices could apply downward demand
    pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC
    operates and increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or
    customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations.
    Additionally, increasing natural gas prices could create the
    need for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchase natural
    gas.

If
    CERC were to fail to renegotiate a contract with one of its
    significant pipeline customers or if CERC renegotiates the
    contract on less favorable terms, there could be an adverse
    impact on its operations.

Since October 31, 2006, CERC’s contract with Laclede
    Gas Company, one of its pipeline customers, has been terminable
    upon one year’s prior notice. CERC has not received a
    termination notice and is currently negotiating a long-term
    contract with Laclede. If Laclede were to terminate this
    contract or if CERC were to renegotiate this contract at rates
    substantially lower than the rates provided in the current
    contract, there could be an adverse effect on CERC’s
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

A
    decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s
    having to provide collateral in order to purchase
    gas.

If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be
    required to post cash collateral in order to purchase natural
    gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash
    collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was
    experiencing significant working capital requirements or
    otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC might be unable to obtain the
    necessary natural gas to meet its obligations to customers, and
    its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    would be adversely affected.

The
    revenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate
    pipelines and field services businesses are subject to
    fluctuations in the supply of natural gas.

CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses
    largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins
    located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. To the
    extent the availability of this supply is



substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on
    CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

CERC’s
    revenues and results of operations are seasonal.

A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from
    natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues
    and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather
    conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues
    being higher during the winter months.

The
    actual construction costs of proposed pipelines and related
    compression facilities may be significantly higher than
    CERC’s current estimates.

Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. are involved in significant pipeline
    construction projects. The construction of new pipelines and
    related compression facilities requires the expenditure of
    significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’s
    estimates. If CERC undertakes these projects, they may not be
    completed at the budgeted cost, on schedule or at all. The
    construction of new pipeline or compression facilities is
    subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs
    of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor
    shortages or delays, inflation or other factors, which could be
    material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is
    typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from
    various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the
    projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or
    conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a
    project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion
    schedule

and/or

increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk
    that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERC’s
    expected investment return, which could adversely affect
    CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

The
    states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution
    may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions
    similar to or broader than those under the 1935 Act regarding
    organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could
    have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to
    operate.

In Arkansas, the APSC in December 2006 adopted rules governing
    affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in
    Arkansas. The rules treat as affiliate transactions all
    transactions between CERC’s Arkansas utility operations and
    other divisions of CERC, as well as transactions between the
    Arkansas utility operations and affiliates of CERC. All such
    affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an
    asymmetrical pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility
    operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of
    providing goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility
    operations and the market value of those goods or services.
    Additionally, the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted
    to participate in any financing other than to finance retail
    utility operations in Arkansas, which would preclude
    continuation of existing financing arrangements in which CERC
    finances its divisions and subsidiaries, including its Arkansas
    utility operations.

Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other
    gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought
    reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the
    APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the
    rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If
    the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration,
    CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the
    rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and
    financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in
    compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may
    seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules
    ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would
    need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or
    would be required to make significant modifications to existing
    practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of
    assets to subsidiaries.

In Minnesota, a bill has been introduced during the current
    session of the legislature that would create a regulatory scheme
    for public utility holding companies like CenterPoint and their
    public utility operations in Minnesota. The proposed legislation
    would restrict financing activities, affiliate arrangements
    between the Minnesota utility operations and the holding company
    and other utility and non-utility operations within the holding
    company and acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the bill
    would require prior MPUC approval of



dividends paid by the holding company, in addition to dividends
    paid by utility subsidiaries, and would limit the level of
    non-utility investments of the holding company.

If either or both of these regulatory frameworks become
    effective, they could have adverse impacts on CERC’s
    ability to operate and provide cost-effective utility service.
    In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions like
    those proposed in Arkansas and Minnesota, it may be difficult
    for CenterPoint and CERC to comply with competing regulatory
    requirements.

Risk
    Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial
    Condition

If we
    are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our
    ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be
    limited.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $9.0 billion of
    outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes
    $2.4 billion of non-recourse transition bonds. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $875 million
    principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through
    2009. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately
    $481 million on transition bonds, for which a dedicated
    revenue stream exists. In addition, we have cash settlement
    obligations with respect to $575 million of outstanding
    3.75% convertible notes on which holders could exercise
    their conversion rights during the first quarter of 2007 and in
    subsequent quarters in which our common stock price causes such
    notes to be convertible. Our future financing activities may
    depend, at least in part, on:

•

the timing and amount of our recovery of the

true-up

components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to
    the courts of determinations on rulings obtained to date;

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from financial institutions and other
    lenders;

•

investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;

•

market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on
    reasonable terms;

•

our exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification
    obligations arising in connection with its separation from
    us; and

•

provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.

As of December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Houston had
    outstanding $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
    general mortgage bonds, including approximately
    $527 million held in trust to secure pollution control
    bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated and
    approximately $229 million held in trust to secure
    pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is
    obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding
    approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of
    first mortgage bonds, including approximately $151 million
    held in trust to secure certain pollution control bonds for
    which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. CenterPoint Houston may
    issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired
    bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the
    trustee. Approximately $2.2 billion of additional first
    mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could
    be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property
    additions as of December 31, 2006. However, CenterPoint
    Houston is contractually prohibited, subject to certain
    exceptions, from issuing additional first mortgage bonds.

Our current credit ratings are discussed in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Future Sources and Uses of
    Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit
    Ratings” in Item 7 of this report. These credit
    ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time
    and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn
    entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings
    are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities.
    Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
    rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our
    credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our
    ability to access capital on acceptable terms.



As a
    holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on
    distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment
    obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual
    restrictions could limit the amount of those
    distributions.

We derive all our operating income from, and hold all our assets
    through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on
    distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment
    obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and
    distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us
    with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends,
    distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of
    applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of
    dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments
    or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree
    to contractual restrictions on their ability to make
    distributions.

Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore
    the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will
    be effectively subordinated to the claims of that
    subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In
    addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our
    rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security
    interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness
    of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.

The
    use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the
    normal course of business could result in financial losses that
    could negatively impact our results of operations and those of
    our subsidiaries.

We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as
    swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity
    and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries could
    recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the
    market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail
    to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and
    pricing information from external sources, the valuation of
    these financial instruments can involve management’s
    judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the
    underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods
    could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

Risks
    Common to Our Businesses and Other Risks

We are
    subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities
    arising from environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and
    regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment, as
    discussed in “Business — Environmental
    Matters” in Item 1 of this report. As an owner or
    operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas
    gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and
    distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and
    regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws
    and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities
    in many ways, such as:

•

restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;

•

limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive
    areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by
    endangered species;

•

requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions
    caused by our operations, or attributable to former
    operations; and

•

enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance
    with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and
    regulations.

In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend
    substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time
    to:

•

construct or acquire new equipment;

•

acquire permits for facility operations;

•

modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and

•

clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and
    management facilities and other locations and facilities.



Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a
    variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement
    measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the
    imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders
    enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes
    impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to
    clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been
    disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for
    neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims
    for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the
    release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the
    environment.

Our
    insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance
    coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact
    our results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

We currently have general liability and property insurance in
    place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we
    consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain
    limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption
    coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future
    at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the
    insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to,
    any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss
    or damage without negative impact on our results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

In common with other companies in its line of business that
    serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have
    insurance covering its transmission and distribution system
    because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive.
    If CenterPoint Houston were to sustain any loss of, or damage
    to, its transmission and distribution properties, it may not be
    able to recover such loss or damage through a change in its
    regulated rates, and any such recovery may not be timely
    granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to
    restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and
    distribution properties without negative impact on its results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We,
    CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated
    with businesses and assets that we have transferred to
    others.

Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could
    incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we,
    CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and
    businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a
    predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through
    subsidiaries and include:

•

those transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with
    the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial
    public offering in 2001; and

•

those transferred to Texas Genco in connection with its
    organization and capitalization.

In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI,
    RRI and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with
    various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to
    them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable
    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,
    including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to
    liabilities associated with the transferred assets and
    businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place
    sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for
    all liabilities associated with the current and historical
    businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those
    liabilities arose. If RRI were unable to satisfy a liability
    that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant
    Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability
    in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC
    could be responsible for satisfying the liability.

Prior to our distribution of our ownership in RRI to our
    shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary. Under
    the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI
    agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to
    separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI
    had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure us and
    CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI
    agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of
    CERC and us, and undertook to use commercially reasonable
    efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. CERC currently
    holds letters of credit in the amount of $33.3 million
    issued on behalf of RRI against guaranties that have not been
    released. Our current exposure under the guaranties relates to
    CERC’s guaranty of the payment by RRI of demand



charges related to transportation contracts with one
    counterparty. The demand charges are approximately
    $53 million per year through 2015, $49 million in
    2016, $38 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. RRI
    continues to meet its obligations under the transportation
    contracts, and we believe current market conditions make those
    contracts valuable for transportation services in the near term.
    However, changes in market conditions could affect the value of
    those contracts. If RRI should fail to perform its obligations
    under the transportation contracts, our exposure to the
    counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security
    provided by RRI. We have requested RRI to increase the amount of
    its existing letters of credit or, in the alternative, to obtain
    a release of CERC’s obligations under the guaranty. In June
    2006, the RRI trading subsidiary and CERC jointly filed a
    complaint at the FERC against the counterparty on the CERC
    guaranty. In the complaint, the RRI trading subsidiary seeks a
    determination by the FERC that the security demanded by the
    counterparty exceeds the level permitted by the FERC’s
    policies. The complaint asks the FERC to require the
    counterparty to release CERC from its guaranty obligation and,
    in its place, accept (i) a guaranty from RRI of the
    obligations of the RRI trading subsidiary, and (ii) letters
    of credit limited to (A) one year of demand charges for a
    transportation agreement related to a 2003 expansion of the
    counterparty’s pipeline, and (B) three months of
    demand charges for three other transportation agreements held by
    the RRI trading subsidiary. The counterparty has argued that the
    amount of the guaranty does not violate the FERC’s policies
    and that the proposed substitution of credit support is not
    authorized under the counterparty’s financing documents or
    required by the FERC’s policy. The parties have now
    completed their submissions to FERC regarding the complaint. We
    cannot predict what action the FERC may take on the complaint or
    when the FERC may rule. In addition to the FERC proceeding, in
    February 2007 CenterPoint and CERC made a formal demand on RRI
    under procedures provided for by the Master Separation
    Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2000, between Reliant
    Energy, Incorporated and Reliant Resources, Inc. That demand
    seeks to resolve the disagreement with RRI over the amount of
    security RRI is obligated to provide with respect to this
    guaranty. It is possible that this demand could lead to an
    arbitration proceeding between the companies, but when and on
    what terms the disagreement with RRI will ultimately be resolved
    cannot be predicted.

RRI’s unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment
    grade. If RRI were unable to meet its obligations, it would need
    to consider, among various options, restructuring under the
    bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor its
    indemnification obligations and claims by RRI’s creditors
    might be made against us as its former owner.

Reliant Energy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of
    lawsuits arising out of energy sales in California and other
    markets and financial reporting matters. Although these matters
    relate to the business and operations of RRI, claims against
    Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include the effect
    of RRI’s financial results on Reliant Energy’s
    historical financial statements and liability of Reliant Energy
    as a controlling shareholder of RRI. We or CenterPoint Houston
    could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits
    were successfully asserted against us or CenterPoint Houston and
    indemnification from RRI were determined to be unavailable or if
    RRI were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with
    respect to those claims.

In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas
    Genco, Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the
    electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it.
    Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable
    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,
    including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities
    associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many
    cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint
    Houston and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third
    parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were
    intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on
    Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated
    with the current and historical businesses and operations of
    Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. In
    connection with the sale of Texas Genco’s fossil generation
    assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC,
    the separation agreement we entered into with Texas Genco in
    connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas
    Genco was amended to provide that all of Texas Genco’s
    rights and obligations under the separation agreement relating
    to its fossil generation assets, including Texas Genco’s
    obligation to indemnify us with respect to liabilities
    associated with the fossil generation assets and related
    business, were assigned to and assumed by Texas Genco LLC. In
    addition, under the amended separation agreement, Texas Genco is
    no longer liable for, and we have assumed and agreed to
    indemnify Texas Genco LLC against, liabilities that Texas Genco
    originally assumed in connection with its organization to the
    extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are
    covered by certain insurance policies or



other similar agreements held by us. If Texas Genco or Texas
    Genco LLC were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so
    assumed or indemnified against, and provided Reliant Energy had
    not been released from the liability in connection with the
    transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for
    satisfying the liability.

We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous
    others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a large number of
    individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Most
    claimants in such litigation have been workers who participated
    in construction of various industrial facilities, including
    power plants. Some of the claimants have worked at locations we
    own, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously
    owned by our subsidiaries but currently owned by Texas Genco
    LLC, which is now known as NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that
    additional claims like those received may be asserted in the
    future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation
    of the generating business from us and its sale to Texas Genco
    LLC, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from
    claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by
    Texas Genco LLC and its successor, but we have agreed to
    continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by
    insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the
    costs of such defense by Texas Genco LLC.

During 2005, we paid irregular quarterly dividends based on
    earnings in each specific quarter in order to comply with
    requirements under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    1935, as amended (1935 Act). The 1935 Act, with its requirements
    associated with dividends, was repealed effective as of
    February 8, 2006.

The closing market price of our common stock on
    December 31, 2006 was $16.58 per share.

The amount of future cash dividends will be subject to
    determination based upon our results of operations and financial
    condition, our future business prospects, any applicable
    contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of
    directors considers relevant and will be declared at the
    discretion of the board of directors.

On February 1, 2007, we announced a regular quarterly cash
    dividend of $0.17 per share, payable on March 9, 2007
    to shareholders of record on February 16, 2007.

Repurchases
    of Equity Securities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, none of our
    equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were purchased by or on behalf
    of us or any of our “affiliated purchasers,” as

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    combination with our consolidated financial statements included
    in Item 8 herein.

OVERVIEW

Background

We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly
    owned subsidiaries include:

•

CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston),
    which engages in the electric transmission and distribution
    business in a

5,000-square

mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and

•

CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and, together
    with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural
    gas distribution systems in six states. Wholly owned
    subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines
    and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary
    services. Another wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers
    variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily
    to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas
    utilities.

Business
    Segments

In this section, we discuss our results from continuing
    operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of
    our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital
    resources and critical accounting policies. CenterPoint Energy
    is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our
    intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy
    business. The results of our business operations are
    significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, cost
    management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and
    other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are
    subject. Our transmission and distribution services are subject
    to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are
    impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other

true-up

balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our
    natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate
    regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution
    business segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    are reporting our interstate pipelines and field services
    businesses as two separate business segments, Interstate
    Pipelines business segment and Field Services business segment.
    These business segments were previously aggregated and reported
    as the Pipelines and Field Services business segment. A summary
    of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2006
    is set forth below:

Electric
    Transmission & Distribution

Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide
    electric transmission and distribution services to REPs serving
    approximately 2.0 million metered customers in a

5,000-square-mile

area of the Texas Gulf coast that has a population of
    approximately 4.8 million people and includes Houston.

On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from
    power plants to substations, from one substation to another and
    to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control
    area managed by ERCOT, which serves as the regional reliability
    coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas.
    ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and
    municipally owned electric utilities, rural electric
    cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and REPs.
    The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for
    power in Texas and is one of the nation’s largest power
    markets. Transmission services are provided under tariffs
    approved by the Texas Utility Commission.

Operations include construction and maintenance of electric
    transmission and distribution facilities, metering services,
    outage response services and other call center operations.
    Distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the
    Texas Utility Commission.



Natural
    Gas Distribution

CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution
    business, which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and
    natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.2 million
    residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas,
    Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.

Competitive
    Natural Gas Sales and Services

CERC’s operations also include non-rate regulated retail
    and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services
    for, commercial and industrial customers in the six states
    listed above as well as several other Midwestern and Eastern
    states.

Interstate
    Pipelines

CERC’s interstate pipelines business owns and operates
    approximately 7,900 miles of gas transmission lines
    primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri,
    Oklahoma and Texas. This business also owns and operates six
    natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability
    of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day and a
    combined working gas capacity of approximately 59.0 Bcf.
    Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma.
    This business has begun construction of two significant pipeline
    additions, in one case as part of a joint venture.

Field
    Services

CERC’s field services business owns and operates
    approximately 3,700 miles of gathering pipelines and
    processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas
    from approximately 150 separate systems located in major
    producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.

Other
    Operations

Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings
    and other real estate used in our business operations and other
    corporate operations which support all of our business
    operations.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

Significant
    Events in 2006 and 2007

Debt
    Financing Transactions

In March 2006, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. entered
    into amended and restated bank credit facilities. We replaced
    our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a
    $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The
    facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate
    (LIBOR) plus 60 basis points based on our current credit
    ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points for
    borrowings under the facility it replaced.

CenterPoint Houston replaced its $200 million five-year
    revolving credit facility with a $300 million five-year
    revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost
    of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint
    Houston’s current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus
    75 basis points for borrowings under the facility it
    replaced.

CERC Corp. replaced its $400 million five-year revolving
    credit facility with a $550 million five-year revolving
    credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR
    plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current
    credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 55 basis points
    for borrowings under the facility it replaced.

Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization
    fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than
    50% of the facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR
    fluctuates based on the borrower’s credit rating.

In May 2006, CERC Corp. issued $325 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in May 2016 with an
    interest rate of 6.15%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used for general corporate



purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt (including
    $145 million of CERC’s 8.90% debentures repaid
    December 15, 2006), capital expenditures and working
    capital.

In December 2006, we called our 2.875% Convertible Senior
    Notes due 2024 (2.875% Convertible Notes) for redemption on
    January 22, 2007 at 100% of their principal amount plus
    accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The
    2.875% Convertible Notes became immediately convertible at
    the option of the holders upon our call for redemption and were
    convertible through the close of business on the redemption
    date. Substantially all the $255 million aggregate
    principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes were
    converted and the remaining amount was redeemed. The
    $255 million principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible
    Notes was settled in cash and the excess value due converting
    holders of $97 million was settled by delivering
    approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock.

In February 2007, we redeemed $103 million aggregate
    principal amount of 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable
    Interest Debentures at 104.1285% of their aggregate principal
    amount and the related 8.257% capital securities issued by
    HL&P Capital Trust II were redeemed at 104.1285% of
    their $100 million aggregate liquidation value.

In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an
    interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our
    $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the
    conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes
    as discussed above.

In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an
    interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of
    receivables under CERC Corp.’s $375 million
    receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased
    liquidity and capital resources for CERC’s general
    corporate purposes.

Agreement
    Regarding Tax Settlement

During the second quarter of 2006, we reached agreement with the
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on terms of a settlement
    regarding the tax treatment of our Zero Premium Exchangeable
    Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and our former Automatic Common
    Exchange Securities (ACES). In July 2006, we signed a closing
    agreement prepared by the IRS and us for the tax years 1999
    through 2029 with respect to the ZENS issue. The agreement
    reached with the IRS and the closing agreement were subject to
    approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the
    U.S. Congress (JCT). As a result of the agreement reached
    with the IRS, we reduced our previously accrued tax and related
    interest reserves by approximately $119 million in the
    second quarter of 2006, and no longer accrue a quarterly reserve.

In January 2007, following JCT approval of certain revised terms
    of the agreement, we and the IRS executed a closing agreement on
    the tax treatment of the ZENS for the tax years 1999 through
    2029. The items in dispute with respect to the ZENS and ACES
    have now been resolved. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    increased our tax and related interest reserve, reducing income
    by approximately $12 million to reflect the January 2007
    closing agreement. Under the terms of the agreement reached with
    the IRS, we will pay approximately $109 million in
    previously accrued taxes associated with the ACES and the ZENS
    and will reduce our future interest deductions associated with
    the ZENS.

Agreement
    regarding settlement of the Electric Transmission &
    Distribution Rate Case and the 2001 Unbundled Cost of Service
    (UCOS) Remand

In September 2006, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas
    Utility Commission) gave final approval to a settlement
    agreement with the parties to the proceeding that resolved the
    issues raised in CenterPoint Houston’s 2006 rate case.
    Under the terms of the agreement, CenterPoint Houston’s
    base rate revenues were reduced by approximately
    $58 million per year. Also, CenterPoint Houston agreed to
    increase its energy efficiency expenditures by an additional
    $10 million per year over the $13 million then
    included in rates. The expenditures will be made to benefit both
    residential and commercial customers. CenterPoint Houston also
    will fund $10 million per year for programs providing
    financial assistance to qualified low-income customers in its
    service territory. The



agreement provides for a rate freeze until June 30, 2010
    under which CenterPoint Houston will not seek to increase its
    base rates and the other parties will not petition to decrease
    those rates.

The agreement also resolves all issues that could be raised in
    the Texas Utility Commission proceeding to review its decision
    in CenterPoint Houston’s 2001 UCOS case. Under the terms of
    the agreement, CenterPoint Houston added riders to its tariff
    rates under which it will provide rate credits to retail and
    wholesale customers for a total of approximately $8 million
    per year until a total of $32 million has been credited to
    customers under those tariff riders. CenterPoint Houston reduced
    revenues and established a corresponding regulatory liability
    for $32 million in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect
    this obligation.

Competition
    Transition Charge (CTC) Interest Rate Reduction

In January 2006, the Texas Utility Commission staff (Staff)
    proposed that the Texas Utility Commission adopt new rules
    governing the carrying charges on unrecovered

true-up

balances. In June 2006, the Texas Utility Commission adopted the
    revised rule as recommended by Staff. The rule, which applies to
    CenterPoint Houston, reduces the allowed interest rate on the
    unrecovered CTC balance prospectively from 11.075 percent
    to a weighted average cost of capital of 8.06 percent. The
    annualized impact on operating income is expected to be
    approximately $18 million per year for the first year with
    lesser impacts in subsequent years. In accordance with the
    agreement discussed above, CenterPoint Houston implemented the
    rule change effective August 1, 2006.

Interstate
    Pipeline Expansion

Carthage to Perryville.

In October 2005, CEGT
    signed a

10-year

firm
    transportation agreement with XTO Energy (XTO) to transport
    600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas from
    Carthage, Texas to CEGT’s Perryville hub in Northeast
    Louisiana. To accommodate this transaction, CEGT filed a
    certificate application with the FERC in March 2006 to build a

172-mile,

42-inch

diameter pipeline and related compression facilities. The
    capacity of the pipeline under this filing will be 1.25 Bcf
    per day. CEGT has signed firm contracts for the full capacity of
    the pipeline.

In October 2006, the FERC issued CEGT’s certificate to
    construct, own and operate the pipeline and compression
    facilities. CEGT has begun construction of the facilities and
    expects to place the facilities in service in the second quarter
    of 2007 at a cost of approximately $500 million.

Based on interest expressed during an open season held in 2006,
    and subject to FERC approval, CEGT may expand capacity of the
    pipeline to 1.5 Bcf per day, which would bring the total
    estimated capital cost of the project to approximately
    $550 million. In September 2006, CEGT filed for approval to
    increase the maximum allowable operating pressure with the U.S.
    Department of Transportation. In December 2006, CEGT filed for
    the necessary certificate to expand capacity of the pipeline
    with the FERC. CEGT expects to receive the approvals in the
    third quarter of 2007.

During the four-year period subsequent to the in-service date of
    the pipeline, XTO can request, and subject to mutual
    negotiations that meet specific financial parameters and to FERC
    approval, CEGT would construct a

67-mile

extension from CEGT’s Perryville hub to an interconnect
    with Texas Eastern Gas Transmission at Union Church, Mississippi.

Southeast Supply Header.

In June 2006,
    CenterPoint Energy Southeast Pipelines Holding, L.L.C., a wholly
    owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. and a subsidiary of Spectra
    Energy Corp. (Spectra) formed a joint venture (Southeast Supply
    Header or SESH) to construct, own and operate a

270-mile

pipeline that will extend from CEGT’s Perryville hub in
    northeast Louisiana to Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is
    50 percent owned by an affiliate of Spectra. In August
    2006, the joint venture signed an agreement with Florida
    Power & Light Company (FPL) for firm transportation
    services, which subscribed approximately half of the planned
    1 Bcf per day capacity of the pipeline. FPL’s
    commitment was contingent on the approval of the FPL contract by
    the Florida Public Service Commission, which was received in
    December 2006. Subject to the joint venture receiving a
    certificate from the FERC to construct, own and operate the
    pipeline, subsidiaries of Spectra and CERC Corp. have committed
    to build the pipeline. In December 2006, the joint venture
    signed agreements with affiliates of Progress Energy Florida,
    Southern Company, Tampa Electric Company, and EOG Resources,
    Inc. bringing the total subscribed capacity to



945 MMcf per day. Additionally, SESH and Southern Natural
    Gas (SNG) have executed a definitive agreement that provides for
    SNG to jointly own the first 115 miles of the pipeline.
    Under the agreement, SNG will own an undivided interest in the
    portion of the pipeline from Perryville, Louisiana to an
    interconnect with SNG in Mississippi. The pipe diameter will be
    increased from 36 inches to 42 inches, thereby
    increasing the initial capacity of 1 Bcf per day by
    140 MMcf per day to accommodate SNG. SESH will own assets
    providing approximately 1 Bcf per day of capacity as
    initially planned and will maintain economic expansion
    opportunities in the future. SNG will own assets providing
    140 MMcf per day of capacity, and the agreement provides
    for a future compression expansion that could increase the
    capacity up to 500 MMcf per day. An application to
    construct, own and operate the pipeline was filed with the FERC
    in December 2006. Subject to receipt of FERC authorization and
    construction in accordance with planned schedule, we currently
    expect an in service date in the summer of 2008. The total cost
    of the combined project is estimated to be $800 to $900 million
    with SESH’s net costs of $700 to $800 million after
    SNG’s contribution.

    Compared to 2005

Income from Continuing Operations.

We reported
    income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of
    $432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for 2006 as
    compared to $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for
    the same period in 2005. As discussed below, the increase in
    income from continuing operations of $207 million was
    primarily due to a $200 million decrease in interest
    expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due
    to lower borrowing costs and borrowing levels; a
    $133 million decrease in income tax expense related to our
    ZENS and ACES; a $19 million increase in operating income
    from our Field Services business segment; a $17 million
    increase in operating income from our Competitive Natural Gas
    Sales and Services business segment; and a $16 million
    increase in operating income from our Interstate Pipelines
    business segment.



These increases in income from continuing operations were
    partially offset by a $121 million decrease in other income
    related to a reduction in the return on the

true-up

balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution
    business segment recorded in 2005 and a $51 million
    decrease in operating income from our Natural Gas Distribution
    business segment. Segment changes are discussed in detail below.

Income Tax Expense.

In 2006, our effective tax
    rate was 12.6%. We reached an agreement with the IRS in January
    2007 and have reduced our previously accrued tax and related
    interest reserves related to the ZENS and ACES by approximately
    $107 million and no longer accrue a quarterly reserve for
    this item. The net reduction in the reserves related to ZENS and
    ACES in 2006 was $92 million. In addition, we reached
    tentative settlements with the IRS on a number of other tax
    matters which allowed us to reduce our total tax and related
    interest reserve for other tax items from $60 million at
    December 31, 2005 to $34 million at December 31,
    2006.

    Compared to 2004

Income from Continuing Operations.

We reported
    income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of
    $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for 2005 as
    compared to $205 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for
    2004. The increase in income from continuing operations of
    $20 million was primarily due to increased operating income
    of $36 million in our Interstate Pipelines business segment
    resulting from increased demand for transportation due to
    increased basis differentials across the system and higher
    demand for ancillary services, increased operating income of
    $19 million in our Field Services business segment as a
    result of increased throughput and demand for services related
    to our core natural gas gathering operations, increased
    operating income of $16 million in our Competitive Natural
    Gas Sales and Services business segment primarily due to higher
    sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the
    pipeline capacity that we control, a decrease in the operating
    loss of $14 million in our Other Operations business
    segment resulting from increased overhead allocated out in 2005
    and a $67 million decrease in interest expense due to lower
    borrowing levels and lower borrowing costs reflecting the
    replacement of certain of our credit facilities. The above
    increases were partially offset by a decrease of
    $105 million in the return on the

true-up

balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution
    business segment as a result of the

True-Up

Order, partially offset by an increase in operating income of
    $21 million related to the return on the

true-up

balance being recovered through the CTC, and decreased operating
    income of $29 million in our Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment, excluding
    the CTC operating income discussed above, primarily from
    increased franchise fees paid to the City of Houston, increased
    depreciation expense and higher operation and maintenance
    expenses, including higher transmission costs, the absence of a
    $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the
    final fuel reconciliation recorded in the second quarter of 2004
    and the absence of an $11 million gain from a land sale
    recorded in 2004, partially offset by increased usage mainly due
    to weather, continued customer growth and higher transmission
    cost recovery. Additionally, income tax expense increased
    $14 million in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Net income for 2005 included an after-tax extraordinary gain of
    $30 million ($0.09 per diluted share) recorded in the
    first quarter reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss
    recorded in the last half of 2004 to write down
    generation-related regulatory assets as a result of the final
    orders issued by the Texas Utility Commission.

Income Tax Expense.

In 2005, our effective tax
    rate was 40.6%. The most significant items affecting our
    effective tax rate in 2005 were an addition to the tax and
    related interest reserves of approximately $41 million
    relating to the contention of the IRS that the current
    deductions for original issue discount (OID) on our ZENS be
    capitalized, potentially converting what have been ordinary
    deductions into capital losses at the time the ZENS are settled,
    partially offset by favorable tax audit adjustments of
    $10 million.

Interest
    Expense and Other Finance Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced borrowings under our
    credit facility by $1.574 billion and retired
    $375 million of trust preferred securities. We expensed
    $15 million of unamortized loan costs in the fourth quarter
    of 2004 that were associated with the credit facility. In
    accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 87-24

“Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations,”
    we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of
    Texas Genco based on net proceeds received from the sale of
    Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds
    to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in each respective
    period according to the terms



of the respective credit facilities in effect for those periods.
    In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid,
    the actual interest paid on the term loan was reclassified. In
    periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be
    repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the
    total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage
    was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to
    compute the amount of interest reclassified.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, CenterPoint Houston retired
    at maturity its $1.341 billion term loan, which bore
    interest at LIBOR plus 975 basis points, subject to a minimum
    LIBOR rate of 3 percent. Borrowings under a CenterPoint
    Houston credit facility, which bore interest at LIBOR plus
    75 basis points, were used for the payment of the term loan
    and then repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the December
    2005 issuance of transition bonds.

Total interest expense incurred was $849 million,
    $711 million and $600 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. We have reclassified $72 million and
    $1 million of interest expense in 2004 and 2005,
    respectively, based upon actual interest expense incurred within
    our discontinued operations and interest expense associated with
    debt that would have been required to be repaid as a result of
    our disposition of Texas Genco.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

The following table presents operating income (in millions) for
    each of our business segments for 2004, 2005 and 2006. Due to
    the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2006,
    we have recast our segment information for 2004 and 2005 to
    conform to the 2006 presentation. The segment detail revised as
    a result of the new reportable business segments did not affect
    consolidated operating income for any year. Included in revenues
    are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if
    the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market
    prices.

2006 Compared to 2005.

Our Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment reported
    operating income of $576 million for 2006, consisting of
    $450 million for the regulated electric transmission and
    distribution utility (TDU) (including $55 million arising
    from the CTC) and $126 million related to the transition
    bonds. For 2005, operating income totaled $487 million,
    consisting of $448 million for the TDU (including
    $19 million arising from the CTC) and $39 million
    related to the transition bonds. Increases in operating income
    from customer growth ($34 million), a higher CTC amount
    collected in 2006 ($36 million), revenues from ancillary
    services ($11 million) and proceeds from land sales
    ($13 million) were partially offset by milder weather and
    reduced demand ($49 million), the implementation of reduced
    base rates ($13 million) and spending on low income
    assistance and energy efficiency programs ($5 million)
    resulting from the Settlement Agreement described in
    “Business — Our Business —
    Regulation — State and Local Regulation —
    Electric Transmission & Distribution —
    CenterPoint Energy Rate Case” in Item 1 of this
    report. In addition, the TDU’s operating income for 2006
    includes the $32 million adverse impact of the resolution
    of the remand of the 2001 UCOS order recorded in the second
    quarter.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Our Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment reported
    operating income of $487 million for 2005, consisting of
    $448 million for the TDU and $39 million related to
    the transition bonds. For 2004, operating income totaled
    $494 million, consisting of $456 million for the TDU
    and $38 million for the transition bonds. Operating
    revenues increased primarily due to increased usage resulting
    from warmer weather ($13 million), continued customer
    growth ($33 million) with the addition of 61,000 metered
    customers in 2005, recovery of our 2004

true-up

balance not covered by the transition bond financing order
    ($21 million) and higher



transmission cost recovery ($13 million). The increase in
    operating revenues was more than offset by higher transmission
    costs ($24 million), the absence of a gain from a land sale
    recorded in 2004 ($11 million), the absence of a
    $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the
    final fuel reconciliation recorded in 2004, increased
    employee-related expenses ($20 million) and higher tree
    trimming expense ($6 million), partially offset by a
    decrease in pension expense ($14 million). Depreciation and
    amortization expense increased ($10 million) primarily as a
    result of higher plant balances. Taxes other than income taxes
    increased ($11 million) primarily due to higher franchise
    fees paid to the City of Houston.

In September 2005, CenterPoint Houston’s service area in
    Texas was adversely affected by Hurricane Rita. Although damage
    to CenterPoint Houston’s electric facilities was limited,
    over 700,000 customers lost power at the height of the storm.
    Power was restored to over a half million customers within
    36 hours and all power was restored in less than five days.
    The Electric Transmission & Distribution business
    segment’s revenues lost as a result of the storm were more
    than offset by warmer than normal weather during the third
    quarter of 2005. CenterPoint Houston deferred $28 million
    of restoration costs which are being amortized over a seven-year
    period that began in October 2006.

2006 Compared to 2005.

Our Natural Gas
    Distribution business segment reported operating income of
    $124 million for 2006 as compared to $175 million for
    2005. Decreases in operating margins (revenues less natural gas
    costs) include a $21 million write-off in the fourth
    quarter of 2006 of purchased gas costs for periods prior to July
    2004, the recovery of which was denied by the MPUC, and the
    impact of milder weather and decreased usage ($30 million).
    These decreases were partially offset by higher margins from
    rate and service charge increases and rate design changes
    ($35 million), along with the addition of over 42,000
    customers in 2006 ($9 million). Operation and maintenance
    expenses increased primarily as a result of costs associated
    with staff reductions ($17 million), benefit costs
    increases ($6 million), higher costs of goods and services
    ($8 million) and higher bad debt expenses
    ($10 million), partially offset by higher litigation
    reserves recorded in 2005 ($11 million).



2005 Compared to 2004.

Our Natural Gas
    Distribution business segment reported operating income of
    $175 million for 2005 as compared to $178 million for
    2004. Increases in operating margins from rate increases
    ($19 million) and margin from gas exchanges
    ($7 million) were partially offset by the impact of milder
    weather and decreased throughput net of continued customer
    growth with the addition of approximately 44,000 customers in
    2005 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance expense
    increased $7 million. Excluding an $8 million charge
    recorded in 2004 for severance costs associated with staff
    reductions, operation and maintenance expenses increased by
    $15 million primarily due to increased litigation reserves
    ($11 million) and increased bad debt expense
    ($9 million), partially offset by the capitalization of
    previously incurred restructuring expenses as allowed by a
    regulatory order from the Railroad Commission of Texas
    ($5 million). Additionally, operating income was
    unfavorably impacted by increased depreciation expense primarily
    due to higher plant balances ($11 million).

During the third quarter of 2005, our east Texas, Louisiana and
    Mississippi natural gas service areas were affected by
    Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damage to our facilities was
    limited, but approximately 10,000 homes and businesses were
    damaged to such an extent that they were not able to, and in
    some cases continue to be unable to, take service. The impact on
    the Natural Gas Distribution business segment’s operating
    income was not material.

2006 Compared to 2005.

Our Competitive Natural Gas
    Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of
    $77 million for 2006 as compared to $60 million for
    2005. The increase in operating income of $17 million was
    primarily driven by improved operating margins (revenues less
    natural gas costs) resulting from seasonal price differentials
    and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity
    that we control ($44 million) and a favorable change in
    unrealized gains resulting from

mark-to-market

accounting ($37 million), partially offset by write-downs
    of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market
    ($66 million).



2005 Compared to 2004.

Our Competitive Natural Gas
    Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of
    $60 million for 2005 as compared to $44 million for
    2004. The increase in operating income of $16 million was
    primarily due to increased operating margins (revenues less
    natural gas costs) related to higher sales to utilities and
    favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we

    transactions ($6 million), partially offset by higher
    payroll and benefit related expenses ($4 million) and
    increased bad debt expense ($3 million).

2006 Compared to 2005.

Our Interstate Pipelines
    business segment reported operating income of $181 million
    for 2006 as compared to $165 million for 2005. Operating
    margins (natural gas sales less gas cost) increased by
    $18 million. This increase was driven primarily by
    increased demand for transportation services and ancillary
    services ($15 million). Operation and maintenance expenses
    decreased by $1 million primarily due to the gain on sale
    of excess gas during 2006 ($18 million) combined with lower
    litigation reserves ($6 million) in 2006 compared to 2005.
    These favorable variances were partially offset by a write-off
    of expenses associated with the Mid-Continent Crossing pipeline
    project which was discontinued in 2006 ($11 million) as
    well as increased operating expenses ($11 million) largely
    associated with staffing increases and costs associated with
    continued compliance with pipeline integrity regulations.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Our Interstate Pipelines
    business segment reported operating income of $165 million
    compared to $129 million in 2004. Operating margins
    (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $29 million.
    The increase was primarily related to increased demand for
    certain transportation services driven by commodity price
    volatility as well as favorable pricing on certain
    transportation deliveries driven by favorable basis
    differentials relative to competing supply areas
    ($42 million). These favorable margin variances were
    partially offset by lower project-related revenues
    ($11 million). Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased
    by $10 million primarily due to lower cost incurred in
    support of project-related revenues ($9 million).

2006 Compared to 2005.

Our Field Services business
    segment reported operating income of $89 million for 2006
    as compared to $70 million for 2005. The increase of
    $19 million was driven by increased gas gathering and
    ancillary services, which reflects contributions from new
    facilities placed in service ($27 million) and higher
    commodity prices ($3 million), partially offset by higher
    operation and maintenance expenses ($10 million).

Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was
    $6 million for each of the years 2006 and 2005 and is
    included in other income.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Our Field Services business
    segment reported operating income of $70 million for 2005
    compared to $51 million in 2004. The increase of
    $19 million was driven by increased gas gathering and
    ancillary services ($22 million) and higher commodity
    prices ($7 million), partially offset by higher operation
    and maintenance expenses ($9 million).

Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was
    $6 million and $2 million for the years 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, and is included in other income.

Our Other Operations
    business segment’s operating loss in 2005 compared to 2004

Discontinued
    Operations

In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority
    owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco LLC. In December
    2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation
    assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC
    for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas
    Genco, whose principal remaining asset was its ownership
    interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed
    $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the
    transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of
    Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us
    of $700 million, was completed in April 2005. We recorded
    an after-tax loss of $133 million and $3 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively,
    related to the operations of Texas Genco.

Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased
    $928 million compared to 2005 primarily due to decreased
    tax payments of $156 million, the majority of which related
    to the tax payment in the first quarter of 2005 associated with
    the sale of our former electric generation business (Texas
    Genco); increased fuel over-recovery ($240 million)
    primarily related to declining gas prices during 2006; decreases
    in net regulatory assets ($271 million), primarily due to
    the termination of excess mitigation credits effective April
    2005 and recovery of regulatory assets through rates; increased
    net accounts receivable/payable ($128 million) primarily due to
    decreased gas prices as compared to 2005 partially offset by
    funding under CERC’s receivables facility being accounted
    for as short-term borrowings instead of sales of receivables
    beginning in October 2006 and decreased cash used in the
    operations of Texas Genco ($38 million). Additionally,
    customer margin deposit requirements decreased
    ($155 million) primarily due to the decline in natural gas
    prices from December 2005 and our margin deposits increased
    ($52 million).

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 decreased
    $673 million compared to 2004 primarily due to increased
    tax payments of $475 million, the majority of which related
    to the tax payment in the second quarter of 2005 associated with
    the sale of Texas Genco, decreased cash provided by Texas Genco
    of $393 million, increased net accounts receivable/payable
    ($151 million), increased gas storage inventory
    ($105 million) and increased fuel under-recovery
    ($154 million), primarily due to higher gas prices in 2005
    as compared to 2004. These decreases were partially offset by
    decreases in net regulatory assets/liabilities
    ($328 million), primarily due to the termination of excess
    mitigation credits effective April 29, 2005, and decreased
    pension contributions of $401 million in 2005 as compared
    to 2004.



Cash
    Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased
    $1.1 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to
    increased capital expenditures of $314 million primarily
    related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution,
    Interstate Pipelines, and Field Services business segments,
    increased restricted cash of transition bond companies of
    $36 million primarily related to the $1.85 billion of
    transition bonds issued in December 2005 and the absence of
    $700 million in proceeds received in the second quarter of
    2005 from the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco and
    cash of Texas Genco of $24 million.

Net cash provided by investing activities decreased
    $1.4 billion in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to
    proceeds of $700 million received from the sale of our
    remaining interest in Texas Genco in April 2005 compared to
    proceeds of $2.947 billion received in 2004 from the sale
    of Texas Genco’s fossil generation assets and increased
    capital expenditures of $89 million, partially offset by
    the purchase of the minority interest in Texas Genco in 2004 of
    $716 million and cash collateralization of letters of
    credit by Texas Genco in 2004 related to its anticipated
    purchase of an additional interest in the South Texas Project in
    the first half of 2005 of $191 million.

Cash
    Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 increased
    $289 million compared to 2005 primarily due to net proceeds
    from the issuance of long-term debt of $324 million,
    decreased repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit
    facility ($236 million) and funding under CERC’s
    receivables facility being accounted for as short-term
    borrowings ($187 million) in 2006, partially offset by the
    absence of borrowings under Texas Genco’s revolving credit
    facility ($75 million) due to the sale of Texas Genco,
    payments of long-term debt ($229 million) and increased
    dividend payments of $63 million.

In 2005, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by
    $66 million. Proceeds from the December 2005 issuance of
    $1.85 billion in transition bonds were used to repay
    borrowings under our credit facility and CenterPoint
    Houston’s $1.3 billion term loan.

Future
    Sources and Uses of Cash

Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by
    our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service
    requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various
    regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory
    actions. Our principal cash requirements for 2007 include the
    following:

•

approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures;

•

cash settlement obligations in connection with possible
    conversions by holders of our 3.75% convertible senior
    notes, having an aggregate principal amount of $575 million;

•

dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and debt
    service payments;

•

settlement of our 2.875% convertible senior notes for
    $255 million and settlement of our 8.257% Junior
    Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures for
    $104 million, as discussed in Notes 8(b) and 15 to our
    consolidated financial statements; and

•

$153 million of maturing long-term debt, including
    $147 million of transition bonds.

We expect that long-term debt securities issued in the first
    quarter of 2007 ($400 million), borrowings under our credit
    facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months.
    Cash needs may also be met by issuing equity or debt securities
    in the capital markets.

Convertible Debt.

As of December 31,
    2006, the 3.75% convertible senior notes discussed in
    Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements have
    been included as current portion of long-term debt in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets because the last reported sale price
    of CenterPoint Energy common stock for at least 20 trading days
    during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
    last trading day of the fourth quarter of 2006 was greater than
    or equal to 120% of the conversion price of the
    3.75% convertible senior notes and therefore, during the
    first quarter of 2007, the 3.75% convertible senior notes
    meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the
    option of the holders of these notes.



As of December 31, 2006, our 2.875% convertible senior
    notes discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial
    statements were included as current portion of long-term debt in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets because in December 2006, we
    called our 2.875% convertible senior notes for redemption
    on January 22, 2007.

Junior Subordinated Debentures (Trust Preferred
    Securities).

As of December 31, 2006, our
    8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures
    discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial
    statements have been included as current portion of long-term
    debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because in December
    2006, we called our 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable
    Interest Debentures for redemption in February 2007.

Arkansas Public Service Commissions, Affiliate Transaction
    Rulemaking Proceeding.

In Arkansas, the APSC in
    December 2006 adopted rules governing affiliate transactions
    involving public utilities operating in Arkansas. The rules
    treat as affiliate transactions all transactions between
    CERC’s Arkansas utility operations and other divisions of
    CERC, as well as transactions between the Arkansas utility
    operations and affiliates of CERC. All such affiliate
    transactions are required to be priced under an asymmetrical
    pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility operations
    would benefit from any difference between the cost of providing
    goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility operations
    and the market value of those goods or services. Additionally,
    the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted to participate
    in any financing other than to finance retail utility operations
    in Arkansas, which would preclude continuation of existing
    financing arrangements in which CERC finances its divisions and
    subsidiaries, including its Arkansas utility operations.

Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other
    gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought
    reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the
    APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the
    rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If
    the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration,
    CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the
    rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and
    financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in
    compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may
    seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules
    ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would
    need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or
    would be required to make significant modifications to existing
    practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of
    assets to subsidiaries.

If this regulatory framework becomes effective, it could have
    adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate and provide
    cost-effective utility service.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

Other than
    operating leases and the guaranties described below, we have no
    off-balance sheet arrangements.

Prior to our distribution of our ownership in RRI to our
    shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary. Under
    the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI
    agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to
    separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI
    had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure us and
    CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI
    agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of
    CERC and us, and undertook to use commercially reasonable
    efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. CERC currently
    holds letters of credit in the amount of $33.3 million
    issued on behalf of RRI against guaranties that have not been
    released. Our current exposure under the guaranties relates to
    CERC’s guaranty of the payment by RRI of demand charges
    related to transportation contracts with one counterparty. The
    demand charges are approximately $53 million per year
    through 2015, $49 million in 2016, $38 million in 2017
    and $13 million in 2018. RRI continues to meet its
    obligations under the transportation contracts, and we believe
    current market conditions make those contracts valuable for
    transportation services in the near term. However, changes in
    market conditions could affect the value of those contracts. If
    RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the
    transportation contracts, our exposure to the counterparty under
    the guaranty could exceed the security provided by RRI. We have
    requested RRI to increase the amount of its existing letters of
    credit or, in the alternative, to obtain a release of
    CERC’s obligations under the guaranty. In June 2006, the
    RRI trading subsidiary and CERC jointly filed a complaint at the
    FERC against the counterparty on the CERC guaranty. In the
    complaint, the RRI trading subsidiary seeks a determination by
    the FERC that the security demanded by the counterparty exceeds
    the level permitted by the FERC’s policies. The complaint
    asks the FERC to require the counterparty to release CERC from
    its guaranty obligation and, in its place, accept (i) a
    guaranty from RRI of the obligations of the RRI trading
    subsidiary, and



(ii) letters of credit limited to (A) one year of
    demand charges for a transportation agreement related to a 2003
    expansion of the counterparty’s pipeline, and
    (B) three months of demand charges for three other
    transportation agreements held by the RRI trading subsidiary.
    The counterparty has argued that the amount of the guaranty does
    not violate the FERC’s policies and that the proposed
    substitution of credit support is not authorized under the
    counterparty’s financing documents or required by the
    FERC’s policy. The parties have now completed their
    submissions to the FERC regarding the complaint. We cannot
    predict what action the FERC may take on the complaint or when
    the FERC may rule. In addition to the FERC proceeding, in
    February 2007 CenterPoint and CERC made a formal demand on RRI
    under procedures provided for by the Master Separation
    Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2000, between Reliant
    Energy, Incorporated and Reliant Resources, Inc. That demand
    seeks to resolve the disagreement with RRI over the amount of
    security RRI is obligated to provide with respect to this
    guaranty. It is possible that this demand could lead to an
    arbitration proceeding between the companies, but when and on
    what terms the disagreement with RRI will ultimately be resolved
    cannot now be predicted.

Senior Notes.

In May 2006, CERC Corp. issued
    $325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
    in May 2016 with an interest rate of 6.15%. The proceeds from
    the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate
    purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt (including
    $145 million of CERC’s 8.90% debentures repaid
    December 15, 2006), capital expenditures and working
    capital.

In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an
    interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our
    $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the
    conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes.

In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an
    interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of
    receivables under CERC Corp.’s $375 million
    receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased
    liquidity and capital resources for CERC’s general
    corporate purposes.

Credit Facilities.

In March 2006, we,
    CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp., entered into amended and
    restated bank credit facilities. We replaced our $1 billion
    five-year revolving credit facility with a $1.2 billion
    five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first
    drawn cost of LIBOR plus 60 basis points based on our current
    credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points
    for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility
    contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition
    bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization (EBITDA) covenant.

CenterPoint Houston replaced its $200 million five-year
    revolving credit facility with a $300 million five-year
    revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost
    of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint
    Houston’s current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus
    75 basis points for borrowings under the facility it
    replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt
    (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization covenant of
    65%.

CERC Corp. replaced its $400 million five-year revolving
    credit facility with a $550 million five-year revolving
    credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR
    plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current
    credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 55 basis points
    for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility
    contains covenants, including a debt to total capitalization
    covenant of 65%.

Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization
    fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than
    50% of the facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR
    fluctuates based on the borrower’s credit rating.
    Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary
    terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we,
    CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to
    borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or
    litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse
    effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are
    subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default
    that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary.

In October 2006, the termination date of CERC’s receivables
    facility was extended to October 2007. The facility size was
    $250 million until December 2006, is $375 million from
    December 2006 to May 2007 and ranges



from $150 million to $325 million during the period
    from May 2007 to the October 30, 2007 termination date of
    the facility.

We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in
    compliance with the various business and financial covenants
    contained in the respective receivables and credit facilities.

As of February 16, 2007, we had the following facilities

Represents outstanding letters of credit.

The $1.2 billion CenterPoint Energy credit facility
    backstops a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under
    which CenterPoint Energy began issuing commercial paper in June
    2005. As of December 31, 2006, there was no commercial
    paper outstanding. The commercial paper is rated “Not
    Prime” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
    (Moody’s),

“A-3”

by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P), a
    division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and “F3” by
    Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) and, as a result, we do not expect to be
    able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our
    short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that
    these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in
    “— Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit
    Ratings,” will remain in effect for any given period of
    time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or
    withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit
    ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our
    securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the
    rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of
    any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or
    more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the
    cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial
    strategies.

Securities Registered with the SEC.

At
    December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Energy had a shelf
    registration statement covering senior debt securities,
    preferred stock and common stock aggregating $1 billion and
    CERC Corp. had a shelf registration statement covering
    $500 million principal amount of senior debt securities.
    Following February 2007 note issuances of $250 million and
    $150 million by CenterPoint Energy and CERC Corp.,
    respectively, CenterPoint Energy’s shelf registration
    statement covered securities aggregating $750 million and
    CERC Corp.’s shelf registration covered $350 million
    principal amount of senior debt securities.

Temporary Investments.

As of December 31,
    2006, we had external temporary investments of less than
    $1 million. As of February 16, 2007, we had external
    temporary investments of $7 million.

Money Pool.

We have a “money pool”
    through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries
    can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are
    aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the
    net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money
    pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint
    Energy’s revolving credit facility or the sale of our
    commercial paper.

Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit
    Ratings.

As of February 16, 2007,
    Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following
    credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain
    subsidiaries:

A “stable” outlook from Moody’s indicates that

    upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook
    was assigned or last affirmed.



(2)

An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a
    long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.

(3)

A “stable” outlook from Fitch encompasses a

one-to-two-year

horizon as to the likely ratings direction.

A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under
    our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint
    Houston’s $300 million credit facility and CERC
    Corp.’s $550 million credit facility. A decline in
    credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on
    long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could
    negatively impact our ability to complete capital market
    transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could
    increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our
    Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and
    Services business segments.

In September 1999, we issued 2.0% ZENS having an original
    principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million
    remain outstanding. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the
    holder’s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to
    95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner
    Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If
    our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders
    thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for
    the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders
    might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for
    the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the
    sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or from other
    sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to approximately 100%
    of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the
    holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash
    outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the ZENS
    notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when
    ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common
    shares are sold. The ultimate tax obligation related to the ZENS
    notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit
    realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow
    when the taxes are paid as a result of ZENS notes maturing or
    being retired.

CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned
    subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural
    Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive
    natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and
    industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout
    the central and eastern United States. In order to economically
    hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives
    with provisions standard for the industry, including those
    pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold
    negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of
    unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To
    the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to
    CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold,
    CES is not obligated to provide collateral.

Mark-to-market

exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely
    collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2006, the amount
    posted as collateral amounted to $113 million. Should the
    credit ratings of CERC Corp. (the credit support provider for
    CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide
    additional collateral on two business days’ notice up to
    the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate
    that as of December 31, 2006, unsecured credit limits
    extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $133 million;
    however, utilized credit capacity is significantly lower. In
    addition, CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas
    under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit
    threshold of $100 million based on CERC Corp.’s
    S&P Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades
    and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease
    the aggregate credit threshold accordingly.

In connection with the development of the Southeast Supply
    Header, CERC Corp. has committed that it will advance funds to
    the joint venture or cause funds to be advanced, up to
    $400 million, for its 50 percent share of the cost to
    construct the pipeline. CERC Corp. also agreed to provide a
    letter of credit in the amount of its share of funds which have
    not been advanced in the event S&P reduces CERC Corp.’s
    bond rating below investment grade before CERC Corp. has
    advanced the required construction funds. However, CERC Corp. is
    relieved of these commitments (i) to the extent of
    50 percent of any borrowing agreements that the joint
    venture has obtained and maintains for funding the construction
    of the pipeline and (ii) to the extent CERC Corp. or its
    subsidiary participating in the joint venture obtains committed
    borrowing agreements pursuant to which funds may be borrowed and
    used for the construction of the pipeline. A similar commitment
    has been provided by the other party to the joint venture.

Cross Defaults.

Under our revolving credit
    facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that
    permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding
    $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries
    will



cause a default. In addition, six outstanding series of our
    senior notes, aggregating $1.4 billion in principal amount
    as of February 16, 2007, provide that a payment default by
    us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an
    acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified
    types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of
    $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint
    Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries’
    debt instruments or bank credit facilities.

Other Factors that Could Affect Cash
    Requirements.

In addition to the above factors,
    our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by:

•

cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with
    certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging
    and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and
    Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments,
    particularly given gas price levels and volatility;

•

acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts
    under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices
    and concentration of natural gas suppliers;

•

increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas;

•

increases in interest expense in connection with debt
    refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities;

•

various regulatory actions;

•

the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their
    obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston
    and in respect of RRI’s indemnity obligations to us and our
    subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations
    to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor;

•

slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables
    due to higher gas prices;

•

cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent
    conversion rights of holders of convertible debt;

•

the outcome of litigation brought by and against us;

•

contributions to benefit plans;

•

restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural
    disasters such as hurricanes; and

•

various other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1A of this report.

Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities
    and Borrow Money.

CenterPoint Houston’s credit
    facility limits CenterPoint Houston’s debt (excluding
    transition bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to
    65 percent. CERC Corp.’s bank facility and its
    receivables facility limit CERC’s debt as a percentage of
    its total capitalization to 65 percent. Our
    $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt to EBITDA
    covenant. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston is contractually
    prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from issuing
    additional first mortgage bonds.



CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    the presentation of our financial condition and results of
    operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective
    or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an
    approximation made by management of a financial statement
    element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting
    estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements
    measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or
    the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting
    estimates described below require us to make assumptions about
    matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
    made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used
    or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely
    to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our
    financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances
    that make these judgments difficult, subjective

and/or

complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the
    effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and
    assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be
    predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to
    be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as
    new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
    information is obtained and as our operating environment
    changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in
    Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe
    the following accounting policies involve the application of
    critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting
    estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit
    committee of the board of directors.

Accounting
    for Rate Regulation

SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71),
    provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report
    assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those
    incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to
    recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the
    competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be
    charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission &
    Distribution business applies SFAS No. 71, which
    results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery
    of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the
    unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from
    our former electric generation operations in our consolidated
    financial statements. Certain expenses and revenues subject to
    utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in
    income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in
    income as the related amounts are included in service rates and
    recovered from or refunded to customers. Significant accounting
    estimates embedded within the application of
    SFAS No. 71 with respect to our Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment relate to
    $304 million of recoverable electric generation-related
    regulatory assets as of December 31, 2006. These costs are
    recoverable under the provisions of the 1999 Texas Electric
    Choice Plan. Based on our analysis of the final order issued by
    the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an after-tax charge to
    earnings in 2004 of approximately $977 million to write
    down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their
    realizable value, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss.
    Based on subsequent orders received from the Texas Utility
    Commission, we recorded an extraordinary gain of
    $30 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2005 related
    to the regulatory asset. Additionally, a district court in
    Travis County, Texas issued a judgment that would have the
    effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus
    interest, of disallowed costs. CenterPoint Houston and other
    parties appealed the district court judgment. Oral arguments
    before the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals were held in January
    2007, but a decision is not expected for several months. No
    amounts related to the district court’s judgment have been
    recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including
    goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may
    not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as
    required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” No impairment of goodwill was indicated
    based on our annual analysis as of July 1, 2006. Unforeseen
    events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and
    material differences in the value of long-lived assets and
    intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows,
    regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect
    the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge.



Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or
    sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be
    estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market
    prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques
    based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or
    revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could
    be different using different estimates and assumptions in these
    valuation techniques.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

We account for our long-lived assets under
    SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), and Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — An Interpretation of
    SFAS No. 143” (FIN 47).
    SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset
    retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in
    which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can
    be made. In the same period, the associated asset retirement
    costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
    related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize
    regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing
    differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in
    accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and
    costs recovered through the ratemaking process.

We estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by
    calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon
    the following components:

•

Inflation adjustment

— The estimated cash flows
    are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor, equipment,
    materials, and other disposal costs;

•

Discount rate

— The estimated cash flows
    include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the
    market risk premium; and

•

Third party markup adjustments

— Internal labor
    costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for
    costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks
    necessary to retire the asset.

Changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation
    recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring
    the assets under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. For
    example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points,
    this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations
    by approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount
    rate by 25 basis points would decrease asset retirement
    obligations by approximately the same percentage. At
    December 31, 2006, our estimated cost of retiring these
    assets is approximately $84 million.

Unbilled
    Energy Revenues

Revenues related to the sale

and/or

delivery of electricity or natural gas (energy) are generally
    recorded when energy is delivered to customers. However, the
    determination of energy sales to individual customers is based
    on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a
    systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month,
    amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the
    last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled
    revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is
    estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable
    rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and
    experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on
    estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted
    for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information
    becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the
    recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results
    can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Pension
    and Other Retirement Plans

We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms
    covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use
    several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate
    future events in calculating the expense and liability related
    to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the
    discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future
    compensation increases as estimated by management, within
    certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use
    subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The
    actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual
    results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher
    or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
    participants. These differences may result in a significant



impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read
    “— Other Significant Matters — Pension
    Plans” for further discussion.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for
    a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.

OTHER
    SIGNIFICANT MATTERS

Pension Plans.

As discussed in Note 2(p)
    to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a
    non-contributory qualified pension plan covering substantially
    all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are
    based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum
    contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible
    contribution for income tax purposes.

Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to
    change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to
    review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal
    to the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the
    Internal Revenue Code.

Although we were not required to make contributions to our
    qualified pension plan in 2005 or 2006, we made a voluntary
    contribution of $75 million in 2005.

Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit
    restoration plan that allows participants to retain the benefits
    to which they would have been entitled under our
    non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated
    limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of
    compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.
    Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration
    plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled
    $10 million and $7 million in 2005 and 2006,
    respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
    Accounting for Pensions,” changes in pension obligations
    and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in
    the income statement, but generally are recognized in future
    years over the remaining average service period of plan
    participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs
    recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of
    benefit payments provided to plan participants.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”
    (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires us, as
    the sponsor of a plan, to (a) recognize on our balance
    sheets as an asset a plan’s over-funded status or as a
    liability such plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure
    a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal
    year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our
    plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to
    other comprehensive income.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of
    December 31, 2006, we recorded a regulatory asset of
    $466 million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive
    income of $79 million, net of tax. For additional
    information regarding the implementation of
    SFAS No. 158, see Note 2(o).

At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation of
    our pension plans exceeded the market value of plan assets by
    $30 million. Changes in interest rates and the market
    values of the securities held by the plan during 2007 could
    materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status
    and affect the level of pension expense and required
    contributions.

Pension costs were $86 million, $36 million and
    $46 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In
    addition, included in the costs for 2004 and 2005 are
    $11 million and less than $1 million, respectively, of
    expense related to Texas Genco participants. Pension expense for
    Texas Genco participants is reflected in our Statement of
    Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations.

The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities
    requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions
    can result in different expense and liability amounts, and
    future actual experience can differ from the



assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed
    discount rate.

As of December 31, 2006, our qualified pension plan had an
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5%, which
    was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31,
    2005. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average,
    will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated
    return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset
    allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate.

As of December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation
    was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.85%, which is a
    0.15% increase from the 5.70% discount rate assumed in 2005. The
    discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality
    bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a
    recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension
    obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan.

Pension expense for 2007, including the benefit restoration
    plan, is estimated to be $15 million based on an expected
    return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 5.85% as of
    December 31, 2006. If the expected return assumption were
    lowered by 0.5% (from 8.5% to 8.0%), 2007 pension expense would
    increase by approximately $9 million.

Currently, pension plan assets (including the unfunded benefit
    restoration plan) exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by
    $30 million. However, if the discount rate were lowered by
    0.5% (from 5.85% to 5.35%), the assumption change would increase
    our projected benefit obligation and 2007 pension expense by
    approximately $123 million and $11 million,
    respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory
    asset recorded as of December 31, 2006 by $95 million
    and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2006 of
    $18 million, net of tax.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the pension plan will impact
    our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict
    with certainty what these factors will be.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Impact of
    Changes in Interest Rates and Energy Commodity Prices

We are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from
    transactions entered into in the normal course of business and
    are inherent in our consolidated financial statements. Most of
    the revenues and income from our business activities are
    impacted by market risks. Categories of market risk include
    exposure to commodity prices through non-trading activities,
    interest rates and equity prices. A description of each market
    risk is set forth below:

•

Commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot
    prices, forward prices and price volatilities of commodities,
    such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk.

•

Interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes
    in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates.

•

Equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of
    individual equity securities.

Management has established comprehensive risk management
    policies to monitor and manage these market risks. We manage
    these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk
    management policies and framework. We manage our exposures
    through the use of derivative financial instruments and
    derivative commodity instrument contracts. During the normal
    course of business, we review our hedging strategies and
    determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon
    the circumstances of each situation.

Derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps
    and options derive their value from underlying assets, indices,
    reference rates or a combination of these factors. These
    derivative instruments include negotiated contracts, which are
    referred to as

over-the-counter

derivatives, and instruments that are listed and traded on an
    exchange.



Derivative transactions are entered into in our non-trading
    operations to manage and hedge certain exposures, such as
    exposure to changes in natural gas prices. We believe that the
    associated market risk of these instruments can best be
    understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being
    hedged.

Interest
    Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding long-term debt, bank
    loans, mandatory redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary
    trust holding solely our junior subordinated debentures (trust
    preferred securities), some lease obligations and our
    obligations under our 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable
    Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) that subject us to the risk
    of loss associated with movements in market interest rates.

Our floating-rate obligations aggregated $3 million and
    $187 million at December 31, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by
    10% from December 31, 2006 rates, our combined interest
    expense would increase by approximately $1 million.

At December 31, 2005 and 2006, we had outstanding
    fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) and trust
    preferred securities aggregating $8.8 billion and
    $8.9 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having
    a fair value of $9.3 billion and $9.6 billion,
    respectively. These instruments are fixed-rate and, therefore,
    do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes
    in market interest rates (please read Note 8 to our
    consolidated financial statements). However, the fair value of
    these instruments would increase by approximately
    $330 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from
    their levels at December 31, 2006. In general, such an
    increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only
    if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in
    the open market prior to their maturity.

As discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial
    statements, upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective
    January 1, 2001, the ZENS obligation was bifurcated into a
    debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of
    $111 million at December 31, 2006 was a fixed-rate
    obligation and, therefore, did not expose us to the risk of loss
    in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However,
    the fair value of the debt component would increase by
    approximately $18 million if interest rates were to decline
    by 10% from levels at December 31, 2006. Changes in the
    fair value of the derivative component, a $372 million
    recorded liability at December 31, 2006, are recorded in
    our Statements of Consolidated Operations and, therefore, we are
    exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component
    as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest
    rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10%
    from December 31, 2006 levels, the fair value of the
    derivative component liability would increase by approximately
    $6 million, which would be recorded as an unrealized loss
    in our Statements of Consolidated Operations.

Equity
    Market Value Risk

We are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership
    of 21.6 million shares of TW Common, which we hold to
    facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the ZENS.
    Please read Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements
    for a discussion of the effect of adoption of
    SFAS No. 133 on our ZENS obligation and our historical
    accounting treatment of our ZENS obligation. A decrease of 10%
    from the December 31, 2006 market value of TW Common would
    result in a net loss of approximately $4 million, which
    would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our Statements of
    Consolidated Operations.

Commodity
    Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities

We use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the
    commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses. The
    stand-alone commodity risk created by these instruments, without
    regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these
    instruments are intended to hedge, is described below. We
    measure the commodity risk of our non-trading energy derivatives
    using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis performed
    on our non-trading energy derivatives measures the potential
    loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10% movement in
    energy prices. At December 31, 2006, the recorded fair
    value of our non-trading energy derivatives was a net liability
    of $102 million. The net liability consisted of a
    $153 million net liability associated with Gas Operations
    price stabilization activities partially offset by a net asset
    of $51 million related to our Competitive Natural Gas Sales
    and Services business. Net assets or liabilities related to Gas
    Operations price stabilization activities



correspond directly with net over/under recovered gas cost
    liabilities or assets on the balance sheet. A decrease of 10% in
    the market prices of energy commodities from their
    December 31, 2006 levels would have decreased the fair
    value of our non-trading energy derivatives by $80 million.

We have a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate and
    business segment officers, that oversees our commodity price and
    credit risk activities, including our trading, marketing, risk
    management services and hedging activities. The committee’s
    duties are to establish commodity risk policies, allocate risk
    capital within limits established by our board of directors,
    approve trading of new products and commodities, monitor risk
    positions and ensure compliance with our risk management
    policies and procedures and trading limits established by our
    board of directors.

Our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial
    instruments. A leveraged financial instrument, for this purpose,
    is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact
    will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or
    volume of the instrument.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
    income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)”, effective December 31, 2006.
    Also, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”, effective
    December 31, 2005.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, that CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
    our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated
    February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the Company’s adoption of new accounting
    standards related to defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans in 2006 and conditional asset retirement
    obligations in 2005.

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Management has designed its internal control over financial
    reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Management’s assessment included review and testing of both
    the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls
    over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts
    and disclosures in the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework, our management has concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
    report on our management’s assessment of the effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 which is included herein on page 64.

CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)  Background
    and Basis of Presentation

(a)

Background

CenterPoint Energy, Inc. is a public utility holding company,
    created on August 31, 2002 as part of a corporate
    restructuring of Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy)
    that implemented certain requirements of the Texas Electric
    Choice Plan (Texas electric restructuring law).

The Company’s operating subsidiaries own and operate
    electric transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas
    distribution facilities, interstate pipelines and natural gas
    gathering, processing and treating facilities. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s indirect wholly owned
    subsidiaries included:

•

CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston),
    which engages in the electric transmission and distribution
    business in a

5,000-square

mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and

•

CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and, together
    with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural
    gas distribution systems in six states. Wholly owned
    subsidiaries of CERC own interstate natural gas pipelines and
    gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services.
    Another wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable
    and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to
    commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas
    utilities.

(b)

Basis
    of Presentation

The Company sold the fossil generation assets of Texas Genco
    Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in December 2004 and completed
    the sale of Texas Genco, which had continued to own an interest
    in a nuclear generating facility, in April 2005.

The consolidated financial statements report the businesses
    described above as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
    (SFAS No. 144).

For a description of the Company’s reportable business
    segments, see Note 14.

(2)  Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Reclassifications
    and Use of Estimates

In addition to the items discussed in Note 3, segment
    information for 2004 and 2005 has been recast to conform to the
    2006 presentation due to the change in reportable segments in
    the fourth quarter of 2006. The segment detail revised as a
    result of the new reportable business segments did not affect
    consolidated operating income for any year.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b)

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accounts of CenterPoint Energy and its wholly owned and
    majority owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
    financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances
    are eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity
    method of accounting for investments in entities in which the
    Company has an ownership interest between 20% and 50% and
    exercises significant influence. Such investments were
    $15 million and $32 million as of December 31,
    2005 and 2006, respectively, and are included as part of other
    noncurrent assets in



CENTERPOINT

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other
    investments, excluding marketable securities, are carried at
    cost.

(c)

Revenues

The Company records revenue for electricity delivery and natural
    gas sales and services under the accrual method and these
    revenues are recognized upon delivery to customers. Electricity
    deliveries not billed by month-end are accrued based on daily
    supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting
    significant historical trends and experience. Natural gas sales
    not billed by month-end are accrued based upon estimated
    purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas
    and currently effective tariff rates. The Interstate Pipelines
    and Field Services business segments record revenues as
    transportation services are provided.

(d)

Long-lived
    Assets and Intangibles

The Company records property, plant and equipment at historical
    cost. The Company expenses repair and maintenance costs as
    incurred. Property, plant and equipment includes the following:

CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests at least
    annually and evaluates goodwill when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets
    may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation for goodwill
    is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the
    fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated
    fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the
    basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair
    value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of
    the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in
    order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that
    should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by
    allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its
    assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any
    unrecognized intangible assets) in a manner similar to a
    purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of
    the goodwill that results from the application of this second
    step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and
    an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.

The Company performed the test at July 1, 2006, the
    Company’s annual impairment testing date, and determined
    that no impairment charge for goodwill was required.

The Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including
    property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable
    intangibles, when events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
    The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based
    on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
    assets, as compared to the carrying value of the assets.

(e)

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

The Company applies the accounting policies established in
    SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), to
    the accounts of the Electric Transmission &
    Distribution business segment and the Natural Gas Distribution
    business segment and to some of the accounts of the Interstate
    Pipelines business segment.

The following is a list of regulatory assets/liabilities
    reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    of December 31, 2005 and 2006:

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158), the Company
    recorded a regulatory asset for its unrecognized costs
    associated with operations that have historically recovered and
    currently recover pension and postretirement expenses in rates.
    See Note 2(n).



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these
    assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Company would be
    required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and
    liabilities. During 2004, the Company wrote-off net regulatory
    assets of $1.5 billion ($977 million after-tax) as an
    extraordinary loss in response to the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order on CenterPoint Houston’s final

true-up

application. Based on subsequent orders received from the Texas
    Utility Commission, the Company recorded an extraordinary gain
    of $47 million ($30 million after-tax) in the second
    quarter of 2005 related to these regulatory assets. For further
    discussion of regulatory assets, see Note 4.

The Company’s rate-regulated businesses recognize removal
    costs as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with
    regulatory treatment. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006,
    these removal costs of $662 million and $697 million,
    respectively, are classified as regulatory liabilities in the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A portion of
    the amount of removal costs that relate to asset retirement
    obligations have been reclassified from a regulated liability to
    an asset retirement liability in accordance with Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (FIN 47).

(f)

Depreciation
    and Amortization Expense

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    economic lives or a regulatory-mandated recovery period.
    Amortization expense includes amortization of regulatory assets
    and other intangibles. See Notes 2(e) and 4(a) for
    additional discussion of these items.

The following table presents depreciation and amortization
    expense for 2004, 2005 and 2006.

Capitalization
    of Interest and Allowance for Funds Used During
    Construction

Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents
    the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds
    and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for
    construction. Although AFUDC increases both utility plant and
    earnings, it is realized in cash through depreciation provisions
    included in rates for subsidiaries that apply
    SFAS No. 71. Interest and AFUDC for subsidiaries that
    apply SFAS No. 71 are capitalized as a component of
    projects under construction and will be amortized over the
    assets’ estimated useful lives. During 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    the Company capitalized interest and AFUDC of $4 million,
    $4 million and $10 million, respectively.

(h)

Income
    Taxes

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and
    follows a policy of comprehensive interperiod income tax
    allocation. The Company uses the liability method of accounting
    for deferred income taxes and measures deferred income taxes for
    all significant income tax temporary differences in accordance
    with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” Investment tax credits were deferred and are being
    amortized over the estimated lives of the related property.
    Management evaluates uncertain tax positions and accrues for
    those which management believes are reasonably estimatable and
    probable of an unfavorable outcome. For additional information
    regarding income taxes, see Note 9.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(i)

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful
    accounts of $43 million and $33 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The provision for
    doubtful accounts in the Company’s Statements of
    Consolidated Operations for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was
    $27 million, $40 million and $35 million,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, CERC had
    $141 million and $187 million of advances,
    respectively, under its receivables facility. CERC Corp. formed
    a bankruptcy remote subsidiary for the sole purpose of buying
    receivables created by CERC and selling those receivables to an
    unrelated third-party. Prior to October 2006, these transactions
    were accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions
    of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” (SFAS No. 140) and, as a
    result, the related receivables were excluded from the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In October 2006, CERC amended its receivables facility and
    extended the termination date to October 30, 2007. The
    facility size was $250 million until December 2006, is
    $375 million from December 2006 to May 2007 and ranges from
    $150 million to $325 million during the period from
    May 2007 to the October 30, 2007 termination date of the
    facility. Under the terms of the amended receivables facility,
    the provisions for off-balance sheet sale accounting under
    SFAS No. 140 were no longer met. Accordingly, advances
    received upon the sale of receivables are accounted for as
    short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2006.

Funding under the receivables facility averaged
    $190 million, $166 million and $79 million in
    2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Sales of receivables were
    approximately $2.4 billion, $2.0 billion and
    $555 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

(j)

Inventory

Inventory consists principally of materials and supplies and
    natural gas. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of
    average cost or market. Natural gas inventories used in the
    retail natural gas distribution operations are also primarily
    valued at the lower of average cost or market. During 2006, the
    Company recorded $66 million in write-downs of natural gas
    inventory to the lower of average cost or market.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company utilizes derivative instruments such as physical
    forward contracts, swaps and options (energy derivatives) to
    mitigate the impact of changes in its natural gas business on
    its operating results and cash flows. Such contracts are
    recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    their fair value unless the Company elects the normal purchase
    and sales exemption for qualified physical transactions. A
    derivative contract may be designated as normal purchase or sale
    if the intent is to physically receive or deliver the product
    for use or sale in the normal course of business. If derivative
    contracts are designated as a cash flow hedge according to
    SFAS 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” the effective portions of the changes
    in their fair values are reflected initially as a separate
    component of shareholders’ equity and subsequently
    recognized in income at the same time as the hedged items. The
    ineffective portions of changes in fair values of derivatives
    designated as hedges are immediately recognized in income.
    Changes in other derivatives not designated as normal or as a
    cash flow hedge are recognized in income as they occur. The
    Company does not enter into or hold derivative financial
    instruments for trading purposes.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate
    and business segment officers that oversees all commodity price
    and credit risk activities, including the Company’s
    trading, marketing, risk management services and hedging
    activities. The committee’s duties are to establish the
    Company’s commodity risk policies, allocate risk capital
    within limits established by the Company’s board of
    directors, approve trading of new products and commodities,
    monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with the
    Company’s risk management policies and procedures and
    trading limits established by the Company’s board of
    directors.

The Company’s policies prohibit the use of leveraged
    financial instruments. A leveraged financial instrument, for
    this purpose, is a transaction involving a derivative whose
    financial impact will be based on an amount other than the
    notional amount or volume of the instrument.

(l)

Investment
    in Other Debt and Equity Securities

In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”
    (SFAS No. 115), the Company reports

“available-for-sale”

securities at estimated fair value within other long-term assets
    in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and any
    unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity and accumulated other comprehensive
    income. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, the Company
    reports “trading” securities at estimated fair value
    in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any
    unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded as other income
    (expense) in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated
    Operations.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, the Company held an
    investment in Time Warner Inc. (TW) common stock (TW Common),
    which was classified as a “trading” security. For
    information regarding this investment, see Note 6.

(m)

Environmental
    Costs

The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures,
    as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. The
    Company expenses amounts that relate to an existing condition
    caused by past operations, and that do not have future economic
    benefit. The Company records undiscounted liabilities related to
    these future costs when environmental assessments

and/or

remediation activities are probable and the costs can be
    reasonably estimated.

(n)

Statements
    of Consolidated Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash
    equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. In
    connection with the issuance of transition bonds in October 2001
    and December 2005, the Company was required to establish
    restricted cash accounts to collateralize the bonds that were
    issued in these financing transactions. These restricted cash
    accounts are not available for withdrawal until the maturity of
    the bonds. Cash and cash equivalents does not include restricted
    cash of $17 million and $49 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. For additional
    information regarding the December 2005 securitization
    financing, see Notes 4(a) and 8(b). Cash and cash
    equivalents includes $40 million and $123 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, that is held by
    the Company’s transition bond subsidiaries for their
    operations related to servicing the transition bonds.

(o)

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
    transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
    estimates the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be
    immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and requires expanded disclosure about the
    information used to measure fair value. The statement applies
    whenever other statements require or permit assets or
    liabilities to be measured at fair value. The statement does not
    expand the use of fair value accounting in any new circumstances
    and is effective for the Company for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and for interim periods included in that
    year, with early adoption encouraged. The Company is evaluating
    the effect of adoption of this new standard on its financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158.
    SFAS No. 158 requires the Company, as the sponsor of a
    plan, to (a) recognize on its Balance Sheets as an asset a
    plan’s over-funded status or as a liability such
    plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s
    assets and obligations as of the end of the Company’s
    fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status
    of its plans in the year in which changes occur through
    adjustments to other comprehensive income. Additional minimum
    liabilities are also derecognized upon adoption of the new
    standard. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of
    December 31, 2006. The following table summarizes the
    effect of the adjustments to record the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158:

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company recorded a
    regulatory asset for its unrecognized costs associated with
    operations that have historically recovered and currently
    recover pension and postretirement expenses in rates. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the
    Company’s compliance with debt covenants.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 permits the Company to choose, at
    specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair
    value (the “fair value option”). The Company would
    report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
    value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent
    reporting period. This accounting standard is effective as of
    the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after
    November 15, 2007. The Company is evaluating the effect of
    adoption of this new standard on its financial position, results
    of operations and cash flows.

Stock-Based
    Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit
    Plans

Stock-Based
    Incentive Compensation Plans

The Company has long-term incentive compensation plans (LICPs)
    that provide for the issuance of stock-based incentives,
    including performance-based shares, performance-based units,
    restricted shares and stock options to officers and key
    employees. A maximum of approximately 36 million shares of
    CenterPoint Energy common stock is authorized to be issued under
    these plans.

Performance-based shares, performance-based units and restricted
    shares are granted to employees without cost to the
    participants. The performance shares and units are distributed
    based upon the performance of the Company over a three-year
    cycle. The restricted shares vest at various times ranging from
    one year to the end of a three-year period. Upon vesting, the
    shares are issued to the participants along with the value of
    common dividends declared during the vesting period. The
    restricted shares granted in 2005 and 2006 are subject to the
    performance condition that total common dividends declared
    during the three-year vesting period must be at least $1.20 and
    $1.80 per share, respectively.

Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal
    to the average of the high and low sales price of the
    Company’s stock at the date of grant. These option awards
    generally become exercisable in one-third increments on each of
    the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have

10-year

contractual terms. No options were granted during 2005 and 2006.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified prospective
    transition method. Under this method, the Company records
    compensation expense at fair value for all awards it grants
    after the date it adopted the standard. In addition, the Company
    records compensation expense at fair value (as previous awards
    continue to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted
    stock option awards that were outstanding as of the date of
    adoption. Pre-adoption awards of time-based restricted stock and
    performance-based restricted stock will continue to be expensed
    using the guidance contained in Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The Company recorded LICP compensation expense of
    $8 million, $13 million and $10 million in 2004,
    2005 and 2006, respectively.

The total income tax benefit recognized related to such
    arrangements was $3 million, $5 million and
    $4 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. No
    compensation cost related to such arrangements was capitalized
    as a part of inventory or fixed assets in 2004, 2005 or 2006.

Pro forma information for 2004 is provided to show the effect of
    amortizing stock-based compensation to expense on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period. Had compensation
    costs been determined as prescribed by

As of December 31, 2006, there was $11 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested LICP
    arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Cash received from LICPs was $4 million, $9 million
    and $17 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

The actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions related to
    LICPs totaled $4 million, $5 million and
    $11 million, for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has a policy of issuing new shares in order to
    satisfy share-based payments related to LICPs.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains a non-contributory qualified defined
    benefit plan covering substantially all employees, with benefits
    determined using a cash balance formula. Under the cash balance
    formula, participants accumulate a retirement benefit based upon
    4% of eligible earnings and accrued interest. Prior to 1999, the
    pension plan accrued benefits based on years of service, final
    average pay and covered compensation. Certain employees
    participating in the plan as of December 31, 1998
    automatically receive the greater of the accrued benefit
    calculated under the prior plan formula through 2008 or the cash
    balance formula. Participants are 100% vested in their benefit
    after completing five years of service. In addition to the
    non-contributory qualified defined benefit plan, the Company
    maintains a non-qualified benefit restoration plan which allows
    participants to receive the benefits to which they would have
    been entitled under the Company’s non-contributory pension
    plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan
    benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan
    benefits may be calculated.

The Company provides certain healthcare and life insurance
    benefits for retired employees on a contributory and
    non-contributory basis. Employees become eligible for these
    benefits if they have met certain age and service requirements
    at retirement, as defined in the plans. Under plan amendments,
    effective in early 1999, healthcare benefits for future retirees
    were changed to limit employer contributions for medical
    coverage.

Such benefit costs are accrued over the active service period of
    employees. The net unrecognized transition obligation, resulting
    from the implementation of accrual accounting, is being
    amortized over approximately 20 years.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158 for its pension and postretirement
    benefits plans. For additional background relating to the
    accounting pronouncement and its impacts, see Note 2(o).

In January 2005, the Department of Health and Human
    Services’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
    released final regulations governing the Medicare prescription
    drug benefit and other key elements of the Medicare
    Modernization Act that went into effect January 1, 2006.
    Under the final regulations, a greater portion of benefits
    offered under the Company’s plans meets the definition of
    actuarial equivalence and therefore qualifies for federal
    subsidies equal to 28% of allowable drug costs. As a result, the
    Company has remeasured its obligations and costs to take into
    account the new regulations. The Medicare subsidy reduced net
    periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately
    $8 million and $17 million for 2005 and 2006,
    respectively.

On January 5, 2006, the Company offered a Voluntary Early
    Retirement Program (VERP) to approximately 200 employees who
    were age 55 or older with at least five years of service as
    of February 28, 2006. The election period was from
    January 5, 2006 through February 28, 2006. For those
    electing to accept the VERP, three years of age and service were
    added to their qualified pension plan benefit and three years of
    service were added to their postretirement benefit. The one-time
    additional pension and postretirement expense of $9 million
    is reflected in the table below as a benefit enhancement.

Savings
    Plan

The Company has a qualified employee savings plan that includes
    a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and an
    employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) under
    Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Under the plan,
    participating employees may contribute a portion of their
    compensation, on a pre-tax or after-tax basis, generally up to a
    maximum of 16% of compensation. The Company matches 75% of the
    first 6% of each employee’s compensation contributed. The
    Company may contribute an additional discretionary match of up
    to 50% of the first 6% of each employee’s compensation
    contributed. These matching contributions are fully vested at
    all times.

Participating employees may elect to invest all or a portion of
    their contributions to the plan in CenterPoint Energy common
    stock, to have dividends reinvested in additional shares or to
    receive dividend payments in cash on any investment in
    CenterPoint Energy common stock, and to transfer all or part of
    their investment in CenterPoint Energy common stock to other
    investment options offered by the plan.

The savings plan has significant holdings of CenterPoint Energy
    common stock. As of December 31, 2006, an aggregate of
    22,728,974 shares of CenterPoint Energy’s common stock
    were held by the savings plan, which represented 27.5% of its
    investments. Given the concentration of the investments in
    CenterPoint Energy’s common stock, the savings plan and its
    participants have market risk related to this investment.

The Company’s savings plan benefit expense was
    $40 million, $35 million and $34 million in 2004,
    2005 and 2006, respectively. Included in these amounts is
    $6 million and less than $1 million savings plan
    benefit expense for 2004 and 2005, respectively, related to
    Texas Genco participants. Amounts for Texas Genco’s
    participants are reflected as discontinued operations in the
    Statements of Consolidated Operations.

Included in “Benefit Obligations” in the accompanying

    are made from the general assets of the Company. During 2004,
    2005 and 2006, the Company recorded benefit expense relating to
    these programs of $9 million, $8 million and
    $6 million, respectively. Included in “Benefit

    compensation plans.

Change
    in Control Agreements and Other Employee Matters

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company entered into
    agreements with certain of its officers that generally provide,
    to the extent applicable, in the case of a change in control of
    the Company and termination of employment, for severance
    benefits of up to three times annual base salary plus bonus, and
    other benefits. By their terms, these agreements are for a
    one-year term with automatic renewal unless action is taken by
    the Board prior to the renewal.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 31% of the
    Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining
    agreements. One agreement, covering approximately 3% of the
    Company’s employees is covered by a collective bargaining
    unit agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical
    Workers Local 949 that expires in December 2007. We have a good
    relationship with this bargaining unit and expect to renegotiate
    new agreements in 2007.

(3)  Discontinued
    Operations

In July 2004, the Company announced its agreement to sell Texas
    Genco to Texas Genco LLC. In December 2004, Texas Genco
    completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal,
    lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for
    $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas
    Genco’s principal remaining asset was its ownership
    interest in the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station,
    a nuclear generating facility (South Texas Project). The final
    step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a
    subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash
    payment to the Company of $700 million, was completed in
    April 2005.

(4)  Regulatory
    Matters

(a)

Recovery
    of

True-Up

Balance

In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its

true-up

application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting
    recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed
    under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004,
    the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order

(True-Up

Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a

true-up

balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included
    interest through August 31, 2004, and providing for
    adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on
    the balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional
    excess mitigation credits returned to customers after
    August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties filed appeals of the

True-Up

Order to a district court in Travis



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

County, Texas. In August 2005, the court issued its final
    judgment on the various appeals. In its judgment, the court
    affirmed most aspects of the

True-Up

Order, but reversed two of the Texas Utility Commission’s
    rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoring
    approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the
    $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed
    from CenterPoint Houston’s initial request. CenterPoint
    Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s
    judgment. Oral arguments before the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals were held in January 2007, but a decision is not
    expected for several months. No amounts related to the district
    court’s judgment have been recorded in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Among the issues raised in CenterPoint Houston’s appeal of
    the

True-Up

Order is the Texas Utility Commission’s reduction of
    CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by
    approximately $146 million for the present value of certain
    deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric
    generation assets. Such reduction was considered in the
    Company’s recording of an after-tax extraordinary loss of
    $977 million in the last half of 2004. The Company believes
    that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed
    regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in
    March 2003 related to those tax benefits. Those proposed
    regulations would have allowed utilities owning assets that were
    deregulated before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive
    election to pass the benefits of Accumulated Deferred Investment
    Tax Credits (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal Income Taxes
    (EDFIT) back to customers. However, in December 2005, the IRS
    withdrew those proposed normalization regulations and issued new
    proposed regulations that do not include the provision allowing
    a retroactive election to pass the tax benefits back to
    customers. In a May 2006 Private Letter Ruling (PLR) issued to a
    Texas utility on facts similar to CenterPoint Houston’s,
    the IRS, without referencing its proposed regulations, ruled
    that a normalization violation would occur if ADITC and EDFIT
    were required to be returned to customers. CenterPoint Houston
    has requested a PLR asking the IRS whether the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s
    stranded cost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT
    would cause a normalization violation. If the IRS determines
    that such reduction would cause a normalization violation with
    respect to the ADITC and the Texas Utility Commission’s
    order relating to such reduction is not reversed or otherwise
    modified, the IRS could require the Company to pay an amount
    equal to CenterPoint Houston’s unamortized ADITC balance as
    of the date that the normalization violation is deemed to have
    occurred. In addition, if a normalization violation with respect
    to EDFIT is deemed to have occurred and the Texas Utility
    Commission’s order relating to such reduction is not
    reversed or otherwise modified, the IRS could deny CenterPoint
    Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation
    benefits beginning in the taxable year that the normalization
    violation is deemed to have occurred. If a normalization
    violation should ultimately be found to exist, it could have a
    material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows. However, the
    Company and CenterPoint Houston are vigorously pursuing the
    appeal of this issue and will seek other relief from the Texas
    Utility Commission to avoid a normalization violation. The Texas
    Utility Commission has not previously required a company subject
    to its jurisdiction to take action that would result in a
    normalization violation.

Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility
    Commission in March 2005 and affirmed in August 2005 by a Travis
    County district court, in December 2005, a subsidiary of
    CenterPoint Houston issued $1.85 billion in transition
    bonds with interest rates ranging from 4.84 percent to
    5.30 percent and final maturity dates ranging from February
    2011 to August 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds,
    CenterPoint Houston recovered approximately $1.7 billion of
    the

true-up

balance determined in the

True-Up

Order plus interest through the date on which the bonds were
    issued.

In July 2005, CenterPoint Houston received an order from the
    Texas Utility Commission allowing it to implement a CTC designed
    to collect approximately $596 million over 14 years
    plus interest at an annual rate of 11.075 percent (CTC
    Order). The CTC Order authorizes CenterPoint Houston to impose a
    charge on retail electric providers to recover the portion of
    the

true-up

balance not covered by the financing order. The CTC Order also
    allows CenterPoint Houston to collect approximately
    $24 million of rate case expenses over three years without
    a return through a separate tariff rider (Rider RCE).
    CenterPoint Houston implemented the CTC and Rider RCE effective
    September 13, 2005 and began recovering approximately
    $620 million. Effective September 13, 2005, the return
    on the CTC portion of the

true-up

balance is included in CenterPoint Houston’s tariff-based
    revenues.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain parties appealed the CTC Order to a district court in
    Travis County. In May 2006, the district court issued a judgment
    reversing the CTC Order in three respects. First, the court
    ruled that the Texas Utility Commission had improperly relied on
    provisions of its rule dealing with the interest rate applicable
    to CTC amounts. The district court reached that conclusion on
    the grounds that the Texas Supreme Court had previously
    invalidated that entire section of the rule. Second, the
    district court reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s
    ruling that allows CenterPoint Houston to recover through the
    Rider RCE the costs (approximately $5 million) for a panel
    appointed by the Texas Utility Commission in connection with the
    valuation of the Company’s electric generation assets.
    Finally, the district court accepted the contention of one party
    that the CTC should not be allocated to retail customers that
    have switched to new

on-site

generation. The Texas Utility Commission and CenterPoint Houston
    disagree with the district court’s conclusions and, in May
    2006, appealed the judgment to the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals, and if required, plan to seek further review from the
    Texas Supreme Court. All briefs in the appeal have been filed.
    Oral arguments were held in December 2006. Pending completion of
    judicial review and any action required by the Texas Utility
    Commission following a remand from the courts, the CTC remains
    in effect. The 11.075 percent interest rate in question was
    applicable from the implementation of the CTC Order on
    September 13, 2005 until August 1, 2006, the effective
    date of the implementation of a new CTC in compliance with the
    new rule discussed below. The ultimate outcome of this matter
    cannot be predicted at this time. However, the Company does not
    expect the disposition of this matter to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s or CenterPoint Houston’s
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the Texas Utility Commission adopted the revised
    rule governing the carrying charges on unrecovered

true-up

balances as recommended by its staff (Staff). The rule, which
    applies to CenterPoint Houston, reduced the allowed interest
    rate on the unrecovered CTC balance prospectively from
    11.075 percent to a weighted average cost of capital of
    8.06 percent. The annualized impact on operating income is
    a reduction of approximately $18 million per year for the
    first year with lesser impacts in subsequent years. In July
    2006, CenterPoint Houston made a compliance filing necessary to
    implement the rule changes effective August 1,
    2006 per the settlement agreement discussed in
    Note 4(d) below under “Rate Case — Electric
    Transmission & Distribution”.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006,
    CenterPoint Houston recognized approximately $19 million
    and $55 million, respectively, in operating income from the
    CTC. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2006, CenterPoint Houston recognized approximately
    $1 million and $13 million, respectively, of the
    allowed equity return not previously recorded. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had not recorded an allowed
    equity return of $234 million on CenterPoint Houston’s

true-up

balance because such return will be recognized as it is
    recovered in rates.

(b)

Final
    Fuel Reconciliation

The results of the Texas Utility Commission’s final
    decision related to CenterPoint Houston’s final fuel
    reconciliation were a component of the

True-Up

Order. CenterPoint Houston has appealed certain portions of the

True-Up

Order involving a disallowance of approximately $67 million
    relating to the final fuel reconciliation in 2003 plus interest
    of $10 million. CenterPoint Houston has fully reserved for
    the disallowance and related interest accrual. A judgment was
    entered by a Travis County district court in May 2005 affirming
    the Texas Utility Commission’s decision. CenterPoint
    Houston filed an appeal to the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals
    in June 2005, and in April 2006, the Texas 3rd Court of
    Appeals issued a judgment affirming the Texas Utility
    Commission’s decision. CenterPoint Houston filed an appeal
    with the Texas Supreme Court in August 2006, and in October
    2006, the Texas Supreme Court requested that the Texas Utility
    Commission and the City of Houston file written responses to
    CenterPoint Houston’s petition for review. Those responses
    were filed in January 2007. In February 2007, CenterPoint
    Houston filed an agreement with the Texas Supreme Court
    indicating that the parties had reached a tentative settlement
    of the appeal. In order for the settlement to become final, the
    Texas Supreme Court must abate the pending appeal, and the Texas
    Utility Commission must issue a final order approving the
    settlement. If the Texas Utility Commission does not approve the
    agreement or modifies the agreement in a manner unacceptable to
    CenterPoint Houston, CenterPoint Houston would be entitled to
    ask the Texas Supreme Court to reinstate the



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

appeal. If the Texas Utility Commission approves the agreement,
    the parties will request the Texas Supreme Court to set aside
    the lower court decisions and remand the case for entry of an
    order approving that settlement. The Texas Supreme Court is not
    required to abate the appeal. If the Texas Supreme Court does
    not abate the appeal, it may request full briefing or deny the
    petition for review. If the petition is denied, the Court of
    Appeals’ judgment would become final. If the petition is
    granted, the Texas Supreme Court would address the merits of
    CenterPoint Houston’s appeal. There is no deadline for the
    Texas Supreme Court’s decisions. As of December 31,
    2006, the Company has not recorded any amounts related to this
    decision.

(c)

Remand
    of 2001 Unbundled Cost of Service (UCOS) Order

The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals remanded to the Texas
    Utility Commission an issue that was decided by the Texas
    Utility Commission in CenterPoint Houston’s 2001 UCOS
    proceeding. In its remand order, the court ruled that the Texas
    Utility Commission had failed to adequately explain the basis
    for its determination of certain projected transmission capital
    expenditures. The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals ordered the
    Texas Utility Commission to reconsider that determination on the
    basis of the record that existed at the time of the Texas
    Utility Commission’s original order. In April 2006, the
    Texas Utility Commission opined orally that the rate base should
    be reduced by $57 million and instructed the Staff to
    quantify the effect on CenterPoint Houston’s rates. In the
    settlement of the CenterPoint Houston rate case described in
    Note 4(e) below under “Rate Cases — Electric
    Transmission & Distribution”, the parties to the
    remand proceeding agreed to settle all issues that could be
    raised in the remand. Under the terms of that settlement,
    CenterPoint Houston implemented riders to its tariff rates under
    which it will provide rate credits to retail and wholesale
    customers for a total of approximately $8 million per year
    until a total of $32 million has been credited to customers
    under those tariff riders. Those riders became effective
    October 10, 2006. CenterPoint Houston reduced revenues and
    established a corresponding regulatory liability of
    $32 million in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect this
    obligation.

(d)

Refund
    of Environmental Retrofit Costs

The

True-Up

Order allowed recovery of approximately $699 million of
    environmental retrofit costs related to CenterPoint
    Houston’s generation assets. The sale of CenterPoint
    Houston’s interest in its generation assets was completed
    in early 2005. The

True-Up

Order required CenterPoint Houston to provide evidence by
    January 31, 2007 that the entire $699 million was
    actually spent by December 31, 2006 on environmental
    programs. The Texas Utility Commission will determine the
    appropriate manner to return to customers any unused portion of
    these funds, including interest on the funds and on stranded
    costs attributable to the environmental costs portion of the
    stranded costs recovery. In January 2007, the Company was
    notified by the successor in interest to CenterPoint
    Houston’s generation assets that, as of December 31,
    2006, it had only spent approximately $664 million. On
    January 31, 2007, CenterPoint Houston made the required
    filing with the Texas Utility Commission identifying
    approximately $35 million in unspent funds to be refunded
    to customers along with approximately $7 million of
    interest and requesting permission to refund these amounts
    through a reduction to the CTC, effective March 1, 2007.
    Such amounts are recorded in regulatory liabilities as of
    December 31, 2006. In February 2007, the Texas Utility
    Commission adopted the Staff’s recommendation for a slower
    procedural schedule than that requested by CenterPoint Houston.
    The procedural schedule as proposed by the Staff would make it
    unlikely that the proposed refund would be effective before
    May 1, 2007. At this time, the Company cannot predict
    whether any party will oppose CenterPoint Houston’s filing
    or whether the Texas Utility Commission will approve CenterPoint
    Houston’s request.

(e)

Rate
    Cases

Electric
    Transmission & Distribution

In December 2005, the Texas Utility Commission ordered the
    commencement of a rate proceeding concerning the reasonableness
    of CenterPoint Houston’s existing rates for transmission
    and distribution service and required



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

CenterPoint Houston to make a filing by April 15, 2006 to
    justify or change those rates. In April 2006, CenterPoint
    Houston filed cost data and other information that supported the
    rates then in effect.

In July 2006, CenterPoint Houston entered into a settlement
    agreement with the parties to the proceeding that resolved the
    issues raised in this matter. CenterPoint Houston filed a
    Stipulation and Agreement (Settlement Agreement) with the Texas
    Utility Commission in August 2006 to seek approval of the
    Settlement Agreement. In September 2006, the Texas Utility
    Commission issued its final order approving the Settlement
    Agreement. Revised base rates and other revised tariffs became
    effective in October 2006.

Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, CenterPoint
    Houston’s base rate revenues were reduced by a net of
    approximately $58 million per year. Also, CenterPoint
    Houston agreed to increase its energy efficiency expenditures by
    an additional $10 million per year over the
    $13 million then included in rates. The expenditures will
    be made to benefit both residential and commercial customers.
    CenterPoint Houston also will fund $10 million per year for
    programs providing financial assistance to qualified low-income
    customers in its service territory.

The Settlement Agreement provides that until June 30, 2010
    CenterPoint Houston will not seek to increase its base rates and
    the other parties will not petition to decrease those rates.
    This rate freeze is subject to adjustments for changes related
    to certain transmission costs, implementation of the Texas
    Utility Commission’s recently-adopted change to its CTC
    rule and certain other changes. The rate freeze does not apply
    to changes required to reflect the result of currently pending
    appeals of the

True-Up

Order, the pending appeal of the Texas Utility Commission’s
    order regarding CenterPoint Houston’s final fuel
    reconciliation, the appeal of the order implementing CenterPoint
    Houston’s CTC or the implementation of transition charges
    associated with current and future securitizations. In addition,
    CenterPoint Houston is not required to file annual earnings
    reports for the calendar years 2006 through 2008, but is
    required to file an earnings report for 2009 no later than
    March 1, 2010. CenterPoint Houston must make a new base
    rate filing not later than June 30, 2010, based on a test
    year ended December 31, 2009, unless the Texas Utility
    Commission staff and certain cities with original jurisdiction
    notify CenterPoint Houston that such a filing is unnecessary.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, in October 2006
    CenterPoint Houston began amortizing expenditures of
    approximately $28 million related to Hurricane Rita over a
    seven-year period and regulatory expenses of approximately
    $7 million over a four-year period. Pursuant to the
    Settlement Agreement, the Texas Utility Commission determined
    that franchise fees payable by CenterPoint Houston under new
    franchise agreements with the City of Houston and certain other
    municipalities in CenterPoint Houston’s service area are
    deemed reasonable and necessary, along with the revised base
    rates.

The Settlement Agreement also resolves all issues that could be
    raised in the Texas Utility Commission’s proceeding to
    review its decision in CenterPoint Houston’s 2001 UCOS
    case. See Note 4(c) above.

Natural
    Gas Distribution

Arkansas.

In January 2007, CERC Corp.’s
    natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations) filed an
    application with the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC)
    to change its natural gas distribution rates. This filing seeks
    approval to change the base rate portion of a customer’s
    natural gas bill, which makes up about 30 percent of the
    total bill and covers the cost of distributing natural gas. The
    filing does not apply to the Gas Supply Rate (GSR), which makes
    up the remaining approximately 70 percent of the bill.
    Through the GSR, Gas Operations passes through to its customers
    the actual cost it pays for the natural gas it purchases for use
    by its customers without any

mark-up.

In
    a separate filing in January 2007, Gas Operations reduced the
    GSR by approximately 9 percent. The APSC approved this GSR
    filing in January 2007.

The filing seeks approval by the APSC of the new rates that
    would go into effect later this year and would generate
    approximately $51 million in additional revenue on an
    annual basis. The effect on individual monthly bills would vary
    depending on natural gas use and customer class. As part of the
    base rate filing, Gas Operations is also proposing a mechanism
    that, if approved, would help stabilize revenues, eliminate the
    potential conflict between its



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

efforts to earn a reasonable return on invested capital while
    promoting energy efficiency initiatives, and minimize the need
    for future rate cases. As part of the revenue stabilization
    mechanism, we proposed to reduce the requested return on equity
    by 35 basis points which would reduce the base rate
    increase by $1 million. The mechanism would be in place
    through December 31, 2010.

In Arkansas, the APSC in December 2006 adopted rules governing
    affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in
    Arkansas. The rules treat as affiliate transactions all
    transactions between CERC’s Arkansas utility operations and
    other divisions of CERC, as well as transactions between the
    Arkansas utility operations and affiliates of CERC. All such
    affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an
    asymmetrical pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility
    operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of
    providing goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility
    operations and the market value of those goods or services.
    Additionally, the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted
    to participate in any financing other than to finance retail
    utility operations in Arkansas, which would preclude
    continuation of existing financing arrangements in which CERC
    finances its divisions and subsidiaries, including its Arkansas
    utility operations.

Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other
    gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought
    reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the
    APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the
    rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If
    the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration,
    CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the
    rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and
    financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in
    compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may
    seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules
    ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would
    need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or
    would be required to make significant modifications to existing
    practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of
    assets to subsidiaries.

If this regulatory framework becomes effective, it could have
    adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate and provide
    cost-effective utility service.

Texas.

In September 2006, Gas Operations filed
    Statements of Intent (SOI) with 47 cities in its Texas
    coast service territory to increase miscellaneous service
    charges and to allow recovery of the costs of financial hedging
    transactions through its purchased gas cost adjustment. In
    November 2006, these changes became effective as all
    47 cities either approved the filings or took no action,
    thereby allowing rates to go into effect by operation of law. In
    December 2006, Gas Operations filed a SOI with the Railroad
    Commission seeking to implement such changes in the environs of
    the Texas coast service territory. Gas Operations’ filing
    has been suspended to allow for discovery and pre-hearing
    conferences, and a final determination is expected in the second
    quarter of 2007.

Minnesota.

At September 30, 2006, Gas
    Operations had recorded approximately $45 million as a
    regulatory asset related to prior years’ unrecovered
    purchased gas costs in its Minnesota service territory. Of the
    total, approximately $24 million related to the period from
    July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006, and approximately
    $21 million related to the period from July 1, 2000
    through June 30, 2004. The amounts related to periods prior
    to July 1, 2004 arose as a result of revisions to the
    calculation of unrecovered purchased gas costs previously
    approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC).
    Recovery of this regulatory asset was dependent upon obtaining a
    waiver from the MPUC rules. In November 2006, the MPUC
    considered the request for variance and voted to deny the
    waiver. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $21 million
    adjustment to reduce pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of
    2006 and reduced the regulatory asset by an equal amount. In
    February 2007, the MPUC denied reconsideration. Although no
    prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this
    matter, the Company expects to appeal the MPUC’s decision
    which precludes recovery of the cost of this gas, which was
    delivered to its customers and for which the Company has never
    been paid.

In November 2005, the Company filed a request with the MPUC to
    increase annual rates by approximately $41 million. In
    December 2005, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase of
    approximately $35 million that was implemented
    January 1, 2006. Any excess of amounts collected under the
    interim rates over the amounts approved

in final rates is subject to refund to customers. In October
    2006, the MPUC considered the request and indicated that it
    could grant a rate increase of approximately $21 million.
    In addition, the MPUC approved a $5 million affordability
    program to assist low-income customers, the actual cost of which
    will be recovered in rates in addition to the $21 million
    rate increase. Although the Minnesota Attorney General’s
    Office (OAG) requested reconsideration of certain parts of the
    MPUC’s decision, in January 2007, the MPUC voted to deny
    reconsideration and a final order was issued in January 2007.
    The proportional share of the excess of the amounts collected in
    interim rates over the amount allowed by the final order will be
    refunded to customers after implementation of final rates. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $12 million has been
    accrued for the refund and was recorded as a reduction of
    revenues through the establishment of a regulatory liability.

In December 2004, the MPUC opened an investigation to determine
    whether Gas Operations’ practices regarding restoring
    natural gas service during the period between October 15 and
    April 15 (Cold Weather Period) were in compliance with the
    MPUC’s Cold Weather Rule (CWR), which governs disconnection
    and reconnection of customers during the Cold Weather Period. In
    June 2005, the OAG issued its report alleging the Company had
    violated the CWR and recommended a $5 million penalty. In
    addition, in June 2005, CERC Corp. was named in a suit filed in
    the United States District Court, District of Minnesota on
    behalf of a purported class of customers who allege that its
    conduct under the CWR was in violation of the law. In August
    2006, the court gave final approval to a $13.5 million
    settlement which resolved all but one small claim against the
    Company which have or could have been asserted by residential
    natural gas customers in the CWR class action. The agreement was
    also approved by the MPUC, resolving the claims made by the OAG.
    The anticipated costs of this settlement were accrued during the
    fourth quarter of 2005.

(f)

City
    of Tyler, Texas Dispute

In July 2002, the City of Tyler, Texas, asserted that Gas
    Operations had overcharged residential and small commercial
    customers in that city for gas costs under supply agreements in
    effect since 1992. That dispute was referred to the Railroad
    Commission by agreement of the parties for a determination of
    whether Gas Operations has properly charged and collected for
    gas service to its residential and commercial customers in its
    Tyler distribution system in accordance with lawful filed
    tariffs during the period beginning November 1, 1992, and
    ending October 31, 2002. In May 2005, the Railroad
    Commission issued a final order finding that Gas Operations had
    complied with its tariffs, acted prudently in entering into its
    gas supply contracts, and prudently managed those contracts. The
    City of Tyler appealed this order to a Travis County District
    Court, but in April 2006, Gas Operations and the City of Tyler
    reached a settlement regarding the rates in the City of Tyler
    and other aspects of the dispute between them. As contemplated
    by that settlement, the City of Tyler’s appeal to the
    district court was dismissed on July 31, 2006, and the
    Railroad Commission’s final order and findings are no
    longer subject to further review or modification.

(5)  Derivative
    Instruments

The Company is exposed to various market risks. These risks
    arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of
    business. The Company utilizes derivative instruments such as
    physical forward contracts, swaps and options (energy
    derivatives) to mitigate the impact of changes in its natural
    gas businesses on its operating results and cash flows.

(a)

Non-Trading
    Activities

Cash Flow Hedges.

The Company enters into
    certain derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges
    under SFAS No. 133. The objective of these derivative
    instruments is to hedge the price risk associated with natural
    gas purchases and sales to reduce cash flow variability related
    to meeting its wholesale and retail customer obligations. During
    the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, hedge
    ineffectiveness resulted in a loss of less than $1 million,
    a loss of $2 million and a gain of $2 million,
    respectively, from derivatives that qualify for and are
    designated as cash flow hedges. No component of the derivative
    instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the assessment
    of effectiveness. If it becomes probable that an anticipated
    transaction will not occur, the Company realizes in net income
    the deferred gains and losses previously recognized in
    accumulated other comprehensive



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

loss. Once the anticipated transaction affects earnings, the
    accumulated deferred gain or loss recognized in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss is reclassified and included in the
    Company’s Statements of Consolidated Operations under the
    “Expenses” caption “Natural gas.” Cash flows
    resulting from these transactions in non-trading energy
    derivatives are included in the Condensed Statements of
    Consolidated Cash Flows in the same category as the item being
    hedged. As of December 31, 2006, the Company expects
    $42 million ($26 million after-tax) in accumulated
    other comprehensive income to be reclassified as a decrease in
    Natural gas expense during the next twelve months.

The maximum length of time the Company is hedging its exposure
    to the variability in future cash flows using financial
    instruments is primarily two years with a limited amount up to
    four years. The Company’s policy is not to exceed ten years
    in hedging its exposure.

Other Derivative Instruments.

The Company
    enters into certain derivative instruments to manage physical
    commodity price risks that do not qualify or are not designated
    as cash flow or fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (SFAS No. 133). While the Company
    utilizes these financial instruments to manage physical
    commodity price risks, it does not engage in proprietary or
    speculative commodity trading. During the years ended
    December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company recognized
    unrealized net gains of $2 million, $2 million and
    $34 million, respectively. These derivative gains are
    included in the Statements of Consolidated Operations under the
    “Expenses” caption “Natural gas.”

Interest Rate Swaps.

During 2002, the Company
    settled forward-starting interest rate swaps having an aggregate
    notional amount of $1.5 billion at a cost of
    $156 million, which was recorded in other comprehensive
    loss and is being amortized into interest expense over the
    five-year life of the designated fixed-rate debt. Amortization
    of amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss for
    2004, 2005 and 2006 was $25 million, $31 million and
    $31 million, respectively. Hedge ineffectiveness was not
    material during each of the years ended December 31, 2004,
    2005 and 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company expects
    $20 million ($13 million after-tax) in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss to be amortized during the next twelve
    months.

Embedded Derivative.

The Company’s 3.75%
    and 2.875% convertible senior notes contain contingent
    interest provisions. The contingent interest component is an
    embedded derivative as defined by SFAS No. 133, and
    accordingly, must be split from the host instrument and recorded
    at fair value on the balance sheet. The value of the contingent
    interest components was not material at issuance or at
    December 31, 2006. All of the Company’s
    2.875% convertible senior notes were either redeemed or
    surrendered for conversion in January 2007, as described in
    Note 8(b), “Long-term Debt — Convertible
    Debt.”

(b) Credit
    Risks

In addition to the risk associated with price movements, credit
    risk is also inherent in the Company’s non-trading
    derivative activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss
    resulting from non-performance of contractual obligations by a
    counterparty. The following table shows the composition of the
    non-trading derivative assets of the Company as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2006 (in millions):

(6)  Indexed
    Debt Securities (ZENS) and Time Warner Securities

(a)

Original
    Investment in Time Warner Securities

In 1995, the Company sold a cable television subsidiary to TW
    and received TW convertible preferred stock (TW Preferred) as
    partial consideration. In July 1999, the Company converted its
    11 million shares of TW Preferred into 45.8 million
    shares of TW Common. A subsidiary of the Company now holds
    21.6 million shares of TW Common which are classified as
    trading securities under SFAS No. 115 and are expected
    to be held to facilitate the Company’s ability to meet its
    obligation under the ZENS. Unrealized gains and losses resulting
    from changes in the market value of the TW Common are recorded
    in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Operations.

(b)

ZENS

In September 1999, the Company issued its 2.0% Zero-Premium
    Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) having an
    original principal amount of $1.0 billion. ZENS are
    exchangeable for cash equal to the market value of a specified
    number of shares of TW common. The Company pays interest on the
    ZENS at an annual rate of 2% plus the amount of any quarterly
    cash dividends paid in respect of the shares of TW Common
    attributable to the ZENS. The principal amount of ZENS is
    subject to being increased or decreased to the extent that the
    annual yield from interest and cash dividends on the reference
    shares of TW Common is less than or more than 2.309%. At
    December 31, 2006, ZENS having an original principal amount
    of $840 million and a contingent principal amount of
    $849 million were outstanding and were exchangeable, at the
    option of the holders, for cash equal to 95% of the market value
    of 21.6 million shares of TW Common deemed to be
    attributable to the ZENS. At December 31, 2006, the market
    value of such shares was approximately $471 million, which
    would provide an exchange amount of $533 for each $1,000
    original principal amount of ZENS. At maturity, the holders of
    the ZENS will receive in cash the higher of the original
    principal amount of the ZENS (subject to adjustment as discussed
    above) or an amount based on the then-current market value of TW
    Common, or other securities distributed with respect to TW
    Common.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective
    January 1, 2001, the ZENS obligation was bifurcated into a
    debt component and a derivative component (the holder’s
    option to receive the appreciated value of TW Common at
    maturity). The derivative component was valued at fair value and
    determined the initial carrying value assigned to the debt
    component ($121 million) as the difference between the
    original principal amount of the ZENS ($1 billion) and the
    fair value of the derivative component at issuance
    ($879 million). Effective January 1, 2001 the debt
    component was recorded at its accreted amount of
    $122 million and the derivative component was recorded at
    its fair value of $788 million, as a current liability.
    Subsequently, the debt component accretes through interest
    charges at 17.5% annually up to the minimum amount payable upon
    maturity of the ZENS in 2029 (approximately $908 million
    assuming no dividends are paid on the TW Common subsequent to
    2006) which reflects exchanges and adjustments to maintain
    a 2.309% annual yield, as discussed above. Changes in the fair
    value of the derivative component are recorded in the
    Company’s Statements of Consolidated Operations. During
    2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded a gain (loss) of
    $31 million, $(44) million and $94 million,
    respectively, on the Company’s investment in TW Common.
    During 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded a gain (loss)
    of $(20) million, $49 million and $(80) million,
    respectively, associated with the fair value of the derivative
    component of the ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of
    the TW Common held by the Company are expected to substantially
    offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of
    the ZENS.

(a)

Short-term
    Borrowings.

In October 2006, CERC amended its receivables facility and
    extended the termination date to October 30, 2007. The
    facility size was $250 million until December 2006,
    $375 million from December 2006 to May 2007 and ranges from
    $150 million to $325 million during the period from
    May 2007 to the October 30, 2007 termination date. Under
    the terms of the amended receivables facility, the provisions
    for sale accounting under SFAS No. 140 were no longer
    met. Accordingly, advances received by CERC upon the sale of
    receivables are accounted for as short-term borrowings as of
    December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006,
    $187 million was advanced for the purchase of receivables
    under CERC’s receivables facility. As of December 31,
    2006, advances had an interest rate of 5.60%.

Long-term
    Debt

Senior Notes.

In May 2006, CERC Corp. issued
    $325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
    in May 2016 with an interest rate of 6.15%. The proceeds from
    the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate
    purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt (including
    $145 million of CERC’s 8.90% debentures repaid
    December 15, 2006), capital expenditures and working
    capital. For a discussion of the Company’s debt
    transactions in 2007, see Note 15.

Revolving Credit Facilities.

In March 2006,
    the Company, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp., entered into
    amended and restated bank credit facilities. The Company
    replaced its $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility
    with a $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility.
    The facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered
    Rate (LIBOR) plus 60 basis points based on the Company’s
    current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus
    87.5 basis points for borrowings under the facility it
    replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt
    (excluding transition bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization covenant.

CenterPoint Houston replaced its $200 million five-year
    revolving credit facility with a $300 million five-year
    revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost
    of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint
    Houston’s current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus
    75 basis points for borrowings under the facility it
    replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt
    (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization covenant of
    65%.

CERC Corp. replaced its $400 million five-year revolving
    credit facility with a $550 million five-year revolving
    credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR
    plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp.’s current
    credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 55 basis points
    for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility
    contains covenants, including a debt to total capitalization
    covenant of 65%.

Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization
    fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than
    50% of the facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR
    fluctuates based on the borrower’s credit rating.
    Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary
    terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the
    Company, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations
    prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse
    changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material
    adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities
    are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of
    default that the Company, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp.
    consider customary.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings and
    approximately $28 million of outstanding letters of credit
    under its $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston
    had no borrowings and approximately $4 million of
    outstanding letters of credit under its $300 million credit
    facility and CERC Corp. had no borrowings and approximately
    $4 million of outstanding letters of credit under its
    $550 million credit facility. Additionally, the Company,
    CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. were in compliance with all
    covenants as of December 31, 2006.

Transition Bonds.

Pursuant to a financing
    order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in March 2005 and
    affirmed in all respects in August 2005 by the same Travis
    County District Court considering the appeal of the True-Up
    Order, in December 2005 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston
    issued $1.85 billion in transition bonds with interest rates
    ranging from 4.84 percent to 5.30 percent and final maturity
    dates ranging from February 2011 to August 2020. Scheduled
    payment dates range from August 2006 to August 2019. Through
    issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered
    approximately $1.7 billion of the true-up balance
    determined in the True-Up Order plus interest through the date
    on which the bonds were issued. The proceeds received from the
    issuance of the transition bonds were used to repay CenterPoint
    Houston’s $1.3 billion credit facility, which was
    utilized in November 2005 to repay CenterPoint Houston’s
    $1.3 billion term loan upon its maturity.

Convertible Debt.

On May 19, 2003, the
    Company issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of
    convertible senior notes due May 15, 2023 with an interest
    rate of 3.75%. As of December 31, 2006, holders could
    convert each of their notes into shares of CenterPoint Energy
    common stock at a conversion rate of 88.3833 shares of
    common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time
    prior to maturity under the following circumstances: (1) if
    the last reported sale price of CenterPoint Energy common stock
    for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive
    trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous
    calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 120% or, following
    May 15, 2008, 110% of the conversion price per share of
    CenterPoint Energy common stock on such last trading day,
    (2) if the notes have been called for redemption,
    (3) during any period in which the credit ratings assigned
    to the notes by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
    (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, are
    lower than Ba2 and BB, respectively, or the notes are no longer
    rated by at least one of these ratings services or their
    successors, or (4) upon the occurrence of specified
    corporate transactions, including the distribution to all
    holders of CenterPoint Energy common stock of certain rights
    entitling them to purchase shares of CenterPoint Energy common
    stock at less than the last reported sale price of a share of
    CenterPoint Energy common stock on the trading day prior to the
    declaration date of the distribution or the distribution to all
    holders of CenterPoint Energy common stock of the Company’s
    assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase the
    Company’s securities, which distribution has a per share
    value exceeding 15% of the last reported sale price of a share
    of CenterPoint Energy common stock on the trading day
    immediately preceding the declaration date for such
    distribution. The notes originally had a conversion rate of
    86.3558 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount
    of notes. However, effective February 16, 2006 and
    November 17, 2006, the conversion rate increased to 87.4094
    and 88.3833, respectively, in accordance with the terms of the
    notes due to quarterly common stock dividends in excess of
    $0.10 per share.

Holders have the right to require the Company to purchase all or
    any portion of the notes for cash on May 15, 2008,
    May 15, 2013 and May 15, 2018 for a purchase price
    equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes. The
    convertible senior notes also have a contingent interest feature
    requiring contingent interest to be paid to holders of notes
    commencing on or after May 15, 2008, in the event that the
    average trading price of a note for the applicable
    five-trading-day period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal
    amount of the note as of the day immediately preceding the first
    day of the applicable six-month interest period. For any
    six-month period, contingent interest will be equal to 0.25% of
    the average trading price of the note for the applicable
    five-trading-day period.

In August 2005, the Company accepted for exchange approximately
    $572 million aggregate principal amount of its
    3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 (Old Notes) for an
    equal amount of its new 3.75% convertible senior notes due
    2023 (New Notes). Old Notes of approximately $3 million
    remain outstanding. Under the terms of the New Notes, which are
    substantially similar to the Old Notes, settlement of the
    principal portion will be made in cash rather than stock.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, the
    3.75% convertible senior notes have been included as
    current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets because the last reported sale price of CenterPoint
    Energy common stock for at least 20 trading days during the
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the fourth quarter of 2006 was greater than or equal to
    120% of the conversion price of the 3.75% convertible
    senior notes and therefore, during the first quarter of 2007,
    the 3.75% convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make
    them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of
    these notes.

On December 17, 2003, the Company issued $255 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due
    January 15, 2024 with an interest rate of 2.875%. As of
    December 31, 2006, holders could convert each of their
    notes into shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock at a
    conversion rate of 79.8969 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes. The notes originally had a
    conversion rate of 78.0640 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes. However, effective
    February 16, 2006 and November 17, 2006, the
    conversion rate increased to 79.0165 and 79.8969, respectively,
    in accordance with the terms of the notes due to quarterly
    common stock dividends in excess of $0.10 per share. As of
    December 31, 2006, these notes were classified as current
    portion of other long-term debt in the Company’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In December 2006, the Company called its 2.875% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2024 (2.875% Convertible Notes) for
    redemption on January 22, 2007 at 100% of their principal
    amount. The 2.875% Convertible Notes became immediately
    convertible at the option of the holders upon the call for
    redemption and were convertible through the close of business on
    the redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million
    aggregate principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes were
    converted. The $255 million principal amount of the
    2.875% Convertible Notes was settled in cash and the excess
    value due converting holders of $97 million was settled by
    delivering approximately 5.6 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock.

Junior Subordinated Debentures (Trust Preferred
    Securities).

In February 1997, a Delaware
    statutory business trust created by CenterPoint Energy (HL&P
    Capital Trust II) issued to the public
    $100 million aggregate amount of capital securities. The
    trust used the proceeds of the offering to purchase junior
    subordinated debentures issued by CenterPoint Energy having an
    interest rate and maturity date that correspond to the
    distribution rate and the mandatory redemption date of the
    capital securities. The amount of outstanding junior
    subordinated debentures discussed above was included in
    long-term debt as of December 31, 2005 and in current
    portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2006.

The junior subordinated debentures are the trust’s sole
    assets and their entire operations. CenterPoint Energy
    considered its obligations under the Amended and Restated
    Declaration of Trust, Indenture, Guaranty Agreement and, where
    applicable, Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities, relating
    to the capital securities, taken together, to constitute a full
    and unconditional guarantee by CenterPoint Energy of the
    trust’s obligations with respect to the capital securities.

The capital securities were mandatorily redeemable upon the
    repayment of the related series of junior subordinated
    debentures at their stated maturity or earlier redemption.

The outstanding aggregate liquidation amount, distribution rate
    and mandatory redemption date of the capital securities of the
    trust described above and the identity and similar terms of the
    related series of junior subordinated debentures were as follows:

Maturities.

The Company’s maturities of
    long-term debt, capital leases and sinking fund requirements,
    excluding the ZENS obligation, are $508 million in 2007,
    $666 million in 2008, $181 million in 2009,
    $397 million in 2010 and $782 million in 2011.

Liens.

As of December 31, 2006,
    CenterPoint Houston’s assets were subject to liens securing
    approximately $253 million of first mortgage bonds. Sinking
    or improvement fund and replacement fund requirements on the
    first mortgage bonds may be satisfied by certification of
    property additions. Sinking fund and replacement fund
    requirements for 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been satisfied by
    certification of property additions. The replacement fund
    requirement to be satisfied in 2007 is approximately
    $160 million, and the sinking fund requirement to be
    satisfied in 2007 is approximately $3 million. The Company
    expects CenterPoint Houston to meet these 2007 obligations by
    certification of property additions. As of December 31,
    2006, CenterPoint Houston’s assets were also subject to
    liens securing approximately $2.0 billion of general
    mortgage bonds which are junior to the liens of the first
    mortgage bonds.

Tax Contingencies.

CenterPoint Energy’s
    consolidated federal income tax returns have been audited and
    settled through the 1996 tax year.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In the audits of the 1997 through 2003 tax years, the IRS
    proposed to disallow all deductions for original issue discount
    (OID), including interest paid, relating to the ZENS, and the
    interest paid on the 7% Automatic Common Exchange Securities
    (ACES) redeemed in 1999. The IRS contended that (1) those
    instruments, in combination with the Company’s long
    position in shares of TW Common, constituted a straddle under
    Sections 1092 and 263(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended and (2) the indebtedness underlying those
    instruments was incurred to carry the TW Common.

The Company and the IRS reached a final settlement on the ACES
    and ZENS issues and executed a closing agreement on the ZENS,
    approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the
    U.S. Congress. As a result of the settlement reached with
    the IRS, the Company reduced its previously accrued tax and
    related interest reserves by approximately $107 million,
    for a net reduction of $92 million in 2006, and will no
    longer accrue quarterly reserves related to the tax treatment of
    the ACES and ZENS.

The Company also reached tentative settlements with the IRS for
    a number of other tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2006;
    including issues associated with prior acquisitions and
    dispositions. Those tentative settlements have allowed the
    Company to reduce its total tax and related interest reserve for
    other tax items from $60 million at December 31, 2005
    to $34 million at December 31, 2006. Most of the
    remaining reserve is related to certain tax positions taken with
    respect to state tax filings and certain items related to
    employee benefits.

Natural
    Gas Supply Commitments

Natural gas supply commitments include natural gas contracts
    related to the Company’s natural gas distribution and
    competitive natural gas sales and services operations, which
    have various quantity requirements and durations, that are not
    classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in
    the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2006 as these contracts meet the
    SFAS No. 133 exemption to be classified as normal
    purchases contracts. Natural gas supply commitments also include
    natural gas transportation and storage contracts that do not
    meet the definition of a derivative. As of December 31,
    2006, minimum payment obligations for natural gas supply
    commitments are approximately $921 million in 2007,
    $294 million in 2008, $210 million in 2009,

Capital
    Commitments

Carthage to Perryville.

In October 2005,
    CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT) signed a

10-year

firm
    transportation agreement with XTO Energy (XTO) to transport
    600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas from
    Carthage, Texas to CEGT’s Perryville hub in Northeast
    Louisiana. To accommodate this transaction, CEGT filed a
    certificate application with the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission (FERC) in March 2006 to build a

172-mile,

42-inch

diameter pipeline and related compression facilities. The
    capacity of the pipeline under this filing will be
    1.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. CEGT has signed firm
    contracts for the full capacity of the pipeline.

In October 2006, the FERC issued CEGT’s certificate to
    construct, own and operate the pipeline and compression
    facilities. CEGT has begun construction of the facilities and
    expects to place the facilities in service in the second quarter
    of 2007 at a cost of approximately $500 million.

Based on interest expressed during an open season held in 2006,
    and subject to FERC approval, CEGT may expand capacity of the
    pipeline to 1.5 Bcf per day, which would bring the total
    estimated capital cost of the project to approximately
    $550 million. In September 2006, CEGT filed for approval to
    increase the maximum allowable operating pressure with the U.S.
    Department of Transportation. In December 2006, CEGT filed for
    the necessary certificate to expand capacity of the pipeline
    with the FERC. CEGT expects to receive the approvals in the
    third quarter of 2007.

During the four-year period subsequent to the in-service date of
    the pipeline, XTO can request, and subject to mutual
    negotiations that meet specific financial parameters and to FERC
    approval, CEGT would construct a

67-mile

extension from CEGT’s Perryville hub to an interconnect
    with Texas Eastern Gas Transmission at Union Church, Mississippi.

Southeast Supply Header.

In June 2006,
    CenterPoint Energy Southeast Pipelines Holding, L.L.C., a wholly
    owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. and a subsidiary of Spectra
    Energy Corp. (Spectra) formed a joint venture (Southeast Supply
    Header or SESH) to construct, own and operate a

270-mile

pipeline that will extend from CEGT’s Perryville hub in
    northeast Louisiana to Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is
    50 percent owned by an affiliate of Spectra. In August
    2006, the joint venture signed an agreement with Florida
    Power & Light Company (FPL) for firm transportation
    services, which subscribed approximately half of the planned
    1 Bcf per day capacity of the pipeline. FPL’s
    commitment was contingent on the approval of the FPL contract by
    the Florida Public Service Commission, which was received in
    December 2006. Subject to the joint venture receiving a
    certificate from the FERC to construct, own and operate the
    pipeline, subsidiaries of Spectra and CERC Corp. have committed
    to build the pipeline. In December 2006, the joint venture
    signed agreements with affiliates of Progress Energy Florida,
    Southern Company, Tampa Electric Company, and EOG Resources,
    Inc. bringing the total subscribed capacity to 945 MMcf per
    day. Additionally, SESH and Southern Natural Gas (SNG) have
    executed a definitive agreement that provides for SNG to jointly
    own the first 115 miles of the pipeline. Under the
    agreement, SNG will own an undivided interest in the portion of
    the pipeline from Perryville, Louisiana to an interconnect with
    SNG in Mississippi. The pipe diameter will be increased from
    36 inches to 42 inches, thereby increasing the initial
    capacity of 1 Bcf per day by 140 MMcf per day to
    accommodate SNG. SESH will own assets providing approximately
    1 Bcf per day of capacity as initially planned and will
    maintain economic expansion opportunities in the future. SNG
    will own assets providing 140 MMcf per day of capacity, and
    the agreement provides for a future compression expansion that
    could increase the capacity up to 500 MMcf per day. An
    application to construct, own and operate the pipeline was filed
    with the FERC in December 2006. Subject to receipt of FERC
    authorization and construction in accordance with planned
    schedule, the Company expects an in-service date in the summer
    of 2008. The total cost of the combined project is estimated to
    be $800 to $900 million with SESH’s net costs of $700
    to $800 million after SNG’s contribution.

Legal
    Matters

RRI
    Indemnified Litigation

The Company, CenterPoint Houston or their predecessor, Reliant
    Energy, and certain of their former subsidiaries are named as
    defendants in several lawsuits described below. Under a master
    separation agreement between the Company and Reliant Energy,
    Inc. (formerly Reliant Resources, Inc.) (RRI), the Company and
    its subsidiaries are entitled to be indemnified by RRI for any
    losses, including attorneys’ fees and other costs, arising
    out of the lawsuits described below under

“Electricity
    and Gas Market Manipulation Cases and Other Class Action
    Lawsuits.”

Pursuant to the indemnification obligation,
    RRI is defending the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent
    named in these lawsuits. The ultimate outcome of these matters
    cannot be predicted at this time.

Electricity and Gas Market Manipulation
    Cases.

A large number of lawsuits have been filed
    against numerous market participants and remain pending in
    federal court in Colorado and Nevada and in state court in
    California, Wisconsin and Nevada in connection with the
    operation of the electricity and natural gas markets in
    California and certain other states in

2000-2001,

a
    time of power shortages and significant increases in prices.
    These lawsuits, many of which have been filed as class actions,
    are based on a number of legal theories, including violation of
    state and federal antitrust laws, laws against unfair and
    unlawful business practices, the federal Racketeer Influenced
    Corrupt Organization Act, false claims statutes and similar
    theories and breaches of contracts to supply power to
    governmental entities. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits, which
    include state officials and governmental entities as well as
    private litigants, are seeking a variety of forms of relief,
    including recovery of compensatory damages (in some cases in
    excess of $1 billion), a trebling of compensatory damages
    and punitive damages, injunctive relief, restitution, interest
    due, disgorgement, civil penalties and fines, costs of suit and
    attorneys’ fees. The Company’s former subsidiary, RRI,
    was a participant in the California markets, owning generating
    plants in the state and participating in both electricity and
    natural gas trading in that state and in western power markets
    generally.

The Company

and/or

Reliant Energy have been named in approximately 35 of these
    lawsuits, which were instituted between 2001 and 2006 and are
    pending in California state court in San Diego County, in
    Nevada state court in Clark County, in Wisconsin state court in
    Dane County, in federal district court in Colorado and Nevada
    and before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the
    Company, CenterPoint Houston and Reliant Energy were not
    participants in the electricity or natural gas markets in
    California. The Company and Reliant Energy have been dismissed
    from certain of the lawsuits, either voluntarily by the
    plaintiffs or by order of the court, and the Company believes it
    is not a proper defendant in the remaining cases and will
    continue to seek dismissal from such remaining cases.

To date, several of the electricity complaints have been
    dismissed, and several of the dismissals have been affirmed by
    appellate courts. Others have been resolved by the settlement
    described in the following paragraph. Five of the gas complaints
    have also been dismissed based on defendants’ claims of
    federal preemption and the filed rate doctrine, and these
    dismissals have been appealed. In June 2005, a San Diego
    state court refused to dismiss other gas complaints on the same
    basis. In October 2006, RRI reached a tentative settlement of
    the 12 class action natural gas cases pending in state court in
    California. This settlement remains subject to final court
    approval. The other gas cases remain in the early procedural
    stages.

In August 2005, RRI reached a settlement with the FERC
    enforcement staff, the states of California, Washington and
    Oregon, California’s three largest investor-owned
    utilities, classes of consumers from California and other
    western states, and a number of California city and county
    government entities that resolves their claims against RRI
    related to the operation of the electricity markets in
    California and certain other western states in

2000-2001.

The settlement also resolves the claims of the three states and
    the investor-owned utilities related to the

2000-2001

natural gas markets. The settlement has been approved by the
    FERC, by the California Public Utilities Commission, and by the
    courts in which the electricity class action cases are pending.
    Two parties have appealed the courts’ approval of the
    settlement to the California Court of Appeals. A party in the
    FERC proceedings filed a



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

motion for rehearing of the FERC’s order approving the
    settlement, which the FERC denied on May 30, 2006. That
    party has filed for review of the FERC’s orders in the
    Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company is not a party to
    the settlement, but may rely on the settlement as a defense to
    any claims brought against it related to the time when the
    Company was an affiliate of RRI. The terms of the settlement do
    not require payment by the Company.

Other Class Action Lawsuits.

In May 2002,
    three class action lawsuits were filed in federal district court
    in Houston on behalf of participants in various employee
    benefits plans sponsored by the Company. Two of the lawsuits
    were dismissed without prejudice. In the remaining lawsuit, the
    Company and certain current and former members of its benefits
    committee are defendants. That lawsuit alleged that the
    defendants breached their fiduciary duties to various employee
    benefits plans, directly or indirectly sponsored by the Company,
    in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974 by permitting the plans to purchase or hold securities
    issued by the Company when it was imprudent to do so, including
    after the prices for such securities became artificially
    inflated because of alleged securities fraud engaged in by the
    defendants. The complaint sought monetary damages for losses
    suffered on behalf of the plans and a putative class of plan
    participants whose accounts held CenterPoint Energy or RRI
    securities, as well as restitution. In January 2006, the federal
    district judge granted a motion for summary judgment filed by
    the Company and the individual defendants. The plaintiffs
    appealed the ruling to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The
    Company believes that this lawsuit is without merit and will
    continue to vigorously defend the case. However, the ultimate
    outcome of this matter cannot be predicted at this time.

Other
    Legal Matters

Natural Gas Measurement Lawsuits.

CERC Corp.
    and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in a lawsuit
    filed in 1997 under the Federal False Claims Act alleging
    mismeasurement of natural gas produced from federal and Indian
    lands. The suit seeks undisclosed damages, along with statutory
    penalties, interest, costs and fees. The complaint is part of a
    larger series of complaints filed against 77 natural gas
    pipelines and their subsidiaries and affiliates. An earlier
    single action making substantially similar allegations against
    the pipelines was dismissed by the federal district court for
    the District of Columbia on grounds of improper joinder and lack
    of jurisdiction. As a result, the various individual complaints
    were filed in numerous courts throughout the country. This case
    has been consolidated, together with the other similar False
    Claims Act cases, in the federal district court in Cheyenne,
    Wyoming. On October 20, 2006, the judge considering this
    matter granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the suit
    on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
    over the claims asserted, but the plaintiff has sought review of
    that dismissal from the Court of Appeals for the
    10th Circuit.

In addition, CERC Corp.  and certain of its
    subsidiaries are defendants in two mismeasurement lawsuits
    brought against approximately 245 pipeline companies and their
    affiliates pending in state court in Stevens County, Kansas. In
    one case (originally filed in May 1999 and amended four times),
    the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of royalty owners
    who allege that the defendants have engaged in systematic
    mismeasurement of the volume of natural gas for more than
    25 years. The plaintiffs amended their petition in this
    suit in July 2003 in response to an order from the judge denying
    certification of the plaintiffs’ alleged class. In the
    amendment the plaintiffs dismissed their claims against certain
    defendants (including two CERC Corp. subsidiaries), limited the
    scope of the class of plaintiffs they purport to represent and
    eliminated previously asserted claims based on mismeasurement of
    the British thermal unit (Btu) content of the gas. The same
    plaintiffs then filed a second lawsuit, again as representatives
    of a class of royalty owners, in which they assert their claims
    that the defendants have engaged in systematic mismeasurement of
    the Btu content of natural gas for more than 25 years. In
    both lawsuits, the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, along
    with statutory penalties, treble damages, interest, costs and
    fees. CERC believes that there has been no systematic
    mismeasurement of gas and that the lawsuits are without merit.
    CERC does not expect the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits to
    have a material impact on the financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows of either the Company or CERC.

Gas Cost Recovery Litigation.

In October 2002,
    a suit was filed in state district court in Wharton County,
    Texas against the Company, CERC, Entex Gas Marketing Company,
    and certain non-affiliated companies alleging



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fraud, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act,
    violations of the Texas Utilities Code, civil conspiracy and
    violations of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act with
    respect to rates charged to certain consumers of natural gas in
    the State of Texas. Subsequently, the plaintiffs added as
    defendants CenterPoint Energy Marketing Inc., CEGT, United Gas,
    Inc., Louisiana Unit Gas Transmission Company, CenterPoint
    Energy Pipeline Services, Inc., and CenterPoint Energy Trading
    and Transportation Group, Inc., all of which are subsidiaries of
    the Company. The plaintiffs alleged that defendants inflated the
    prices charged to certain consumers of natural gas. In February
    2003, a similar lawsuit was filed in state court in Caddo
    Parish, Louisiana against CERC with respect to rates charged to
    a purported class of certain consumers of natural gas and gas
    service in the State of Louisiana. In February 2004, another
    suit was filed in state court in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana
    against CERC seeking to recover alleged overcharges for gas or
    gas services allegedly provided by CERC to a purported class of
    certain consumers of natural gas and gas service without advance
    approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). In
    October 2004, a similar case was filed in district court in
    Miller County, Arkansas against the Company, CERC, Entex Gas
    Marketing Company, CEGT, CenterPoint Energy Field Services,
    CenterPoint Energy Pipeline Services, Inc., Mississippi River
    Transmission Corp. (MRT) and other non-affiliated companies
    alleging fraud, unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy with
    respect to rates charged to certain consumers of natural gas in
    at least the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
    Oklahoma and Texas. Subsequently, the plaintiffs dropped as
    defendants CEGT and MRT. At the time of the filing of each of
    the Caddo and Calcasieu Parish cases, the plaintiffs in those
    cases filed petitions with the LPSC relating to the same alleged
    rate overcharges. The Caddo and Calcasieu Parish cases have been
    stayed pending the resolution of the respective proceedings by
    the LPSC. The plaintiffs in the Miller County case seek class
    certification, but the proposed class has not been certified. In
    February 2005, the Wharton County case was removed to federal
    district court in Houston, Texas, and in March 2005, the
    plaintiffs voluntarily moved to dismiss the case and agreed not
    to refile the claims asserted unless the Miller County case is
    not certified as a class action or is later decertified. The
    range of relief sought by the plaintiffs in these cases includes
    injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution for the alleged
    overcharges, exemplary damages or trebling of actual damages,
    civil penalties and attorney’s fees. In these cases, the
    Company, CERC and their affiliates deny that they have
    overcharged any of their customers for natural gas and believe
    that the amounts recovered for purchased gas have been in
    accordance with what is permitted by state and municipal
    regulatory authorities. The allegations in these cases are
    similar to those asserted in the City of Tyler proceeding, as
    described in Note 4(f). The Company and CERC do not expect
    the outcome of these matters to have a material impact on the
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of
    either the Company or CERC.

Storage Facility Litigation.

In February 2007,
    an Oklahoma district court in Coal Creek County, Oklahoma,
    granted a summary judgment against CEGT in a case, Deka
    Exploration, Inc. v. CenterPoint Energy, filed by holders
    of oil and gas leaseholds and some mineral interest owners in
    lands underlying CEGT’s Chiles Dome Storage Facility. The
    dispute concerns “native gas” that may have been in
    the Wapanucka formation underlying the Chiles Dome facility when
    that facility was constructed in 1979 by a CERC entity that was
    the predecessor in interest of CEGT. The court ruled that the
    plaintiffs own native gas underlying those lands, since neither
    CEGT nor its predecessors had condemned those ownership
    interests. The court rejected CEGT’s contention that the
    claim should be barred by the statute of limitations, since suit
    was filed over 25 years after the facility was constructed.
    The court also rejected CEGT’s contention that the suit is
    an impermissible attack on the determinations the FERC and
    Oklahoma Corporation Commission made regarding the absence of
    native gas in the lands when the facility was constructed. The
    summary judgment ruling was only on the issue of liability,
    though the court did rule that CEGT has the burden of proving
    that any gas in the Wapanucka formation is gas that has been
    injected and is not native gas. Further hearings and orders of
    the court are required to specify the appropriate relief for the
    plaintiffs. CEGT plans to appeal through the Oklahoma court
    system any judgment which imposes liability on CEGT in this
    matter. The Company and CERC do not expect the outcome of this
    matter to have a material impact on the financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows of either the Company or
    CERC.

Pipeline Safety Compliance.

Pursuant to an
    order from the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety, CERC
    substantially completed removal of certain non-code-compliant
    components from a portion of its distribution

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

system by December 2, 2005. The components were installed
    by a predecessor company, which was not affiliated with CERC
    during the period in which the components were installed. In
    November 2005, CERC Corp. filed a request with the MPUC to
    recover the capitalized expenditures (approximately
    $39 million) and related expenses, together with a return
    on the capitalized portion through rates as part of its then
    existing rate case as further discussed in Note 4(e). As
    part of its final rate order, the MPUC allowed capitalized
    expenditures, plus approximately $2 million previously
    expensed in 2005, in rate base. Return on approximately
    $4 million of the $41 million is limited to the cost
    of long-term debt included in the cost of capital pending the
    outcome of litigation against the predecessor companies that
    installed the original service lines.

Minnesota Cold Weather Rule.

For a discussion
    of this matter, see Note 4(e) above.

Environmental
    Matters

Hydrocarbon Contamination.

CERC Corp. and
    certain of its subsidiaries are among the defendants in lawsuits
    filed beginning in August 2001 in Caddo Parish and Bossier
    Parish, Louisiana. The suits allege that, at some unspecified
    date prior to 1985, the defendants allowed or caused hydrocarbon
    or chemical contamination of the Wilcox Aquifer, which lies
    beneath property owned or leased by certain of the defendants
    and which is the sole or primary drinking water aquifer in the
    area. The primary source of the contamination is alleged by the
    plaintiffs to be a gas processing facility in Haughton, Bossier
    Parish, Louisiana known as the “Sligo Facility,” which
    was formerly operated by a predecessor in interest of CERC Corp.
    This facility was purportedly used for gathering natural gas
    from surrounding wells, separating liquid hydrocarbons from the
    natural gas for marketing, and transmission of natural gas for
    distribution.

Beginning about 1985, the predecessors of certain CERC Corp.
    defendants engaged in a voluntary remediation of any subsurface
    contamination of the groundwater below the property they owned
    or leased. This work has been done in conjunction with and under
    the direction of the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages for alleged damage
    to the aquifer underlying their property, including the cost of
    restoring their property to its original condition and damages
    for diminution of value of their property. In addition,
    plaintiffs seek damages for trespass, punitive, and exemplary
    damages. The parties have reached an agreement on terms of a
    settlement in principle of this matter. That settlement would
    require approval from the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality of an acceptable remediation plan that could be
    implemented by CERC. CERC currently is seeking that approval. If
    the currently agreed terms for settlement are ultimately
    implemented, the Company and CERC do not expect the ultimate
    cost associated with resolving this matter to have a material
    impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows of either the Company or CERC.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.

CERC and its
    predecessors operated manufactured gas plants (MGP) in the past.
    In Minnesota, CERC has completed remediation on two sites, other
    than ongoing monitoring and water treatment. There are five
    remaining sites in CERC’s Minnesota service territory. CERC
    believes that it has no liability with respect to two of these
    sites.

At December 31, 2006, CERC had accrued $14 million for
    remediation of these Minnesota sites. At December 31, 2006,
    the estimated range of possible remediation costs for these
    sites was $4 million to $35 million based on
    remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years. The cost
    estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average
    costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual
    remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to
    be remediated, the participation of other potentially
    responsible parties (PRP), if any, and the remediation methods
    used. CERC has utilized an environmental expense tracker
    mechanism in its rates in Minnesota to recover estimated costs
    in excess of insurance recovery. As of December 31, 2006,
    CERC had collected $13 million from insurance companies and
    rate payers to be used for future environmental remediation.

In addition to the Minnesota sites, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators have
    investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CERC or
    may have been owned by one of its former affiliates. CERC has
    been named as a defendant in two lawsuits, one filed in the
    United States District Court,



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

District of Maine and the other filed in the Middle District of
    Florida, Jacksonville Division, under which contribution is
    sought by private parties for the cost to remediate former MGP
    sites based on the previous ownership of such sites by former
    affiliates of CERC or its divisions. CERC has also been
    identified as a PRP by the State of Maine for a site that is the
    subject of one of the lawsuits. In March 2005, the federal
    district court considering the suit for contribution in Florida
    granted CERC’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that CERC
    was not an “operator” of the site as had been alleged.
    In October 2006, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed
    the district court’s dismissal. In June 2006, the federal
    district court in Maine that is considering the other suit ruled
    that the current owner of the site is responsible for site
    remediation but that an additional evidentiary hearing is
    required to determine if other potentially responsible parties,
    including CERC, would have to contribute to that remediation.
    The Company is investigating details regarding these sites and
    the range of environmental expenditures for potential
    remediation. However, CERC believes it is not liable as a former
    owner or operator of those sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, and applicable state statutes, and is vigorously
    contesting those suits and its designation as a PRP.

Mercury Contamination.

The Company’s
    pipeline and distribution operations have in the past employed
    elemental mercury in measuring and regulating equipment. It is
    possible that small amounts of mercury may have been spilled in
    the course of normal maintenance and replacement operations and
    that these spills may have contaminated the immediate area with
    elemental mercury. The Company has found this type of
    contamination at some sites in the past, and the Company has
    conducted remediation at these sites. It is possible that other
    contaminated sites may exist and that remediation costs may be
    incurred for these sites. Although the total amount of these
    costs is not known at this time, based on the Company’s
    experience and that of others in the natural gas industry to
    date and on the current regulations regarding remediation of
    these sites, the Company believes that the costs of any
    remediation of these sites will not be material to the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Asbestos.

Some facilities owned by the Company
    contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other
    asbestos-containing materials. The Company or its subsidiaries
    have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in
    lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due
    to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at
    locations owned by the Company, but most existing claims relate
    to facilities previously owned by the Company or its
    subsidiaries. The Company anticipates that additional claims
    like those received may be asserted in the future. In 2004, the
    Company sold its generating business, to which most of these
    claims relate, to Texas Genco LLC, which is now known as NRG
    Texas LP (NRG). Under the terms of the arrangements regarding
    separation of the generating business from the Company and its
    sale to Texas Genco LLC, ultimate financial responsibility for
    uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business
    has been assumed by Texas Genco LLC and its successor, but the
    Company has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the
    extent they are covered by insurance maintained by the Company,
    subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense from the
    purchaser. Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted
    at this time, the Company intends to continue vigorously
    contesting claims that it does not consider to have merit and
    does not expect, based on its experience to date, these matters,
    either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Other Environmental.

From time to time the
    Company has received notices from regulatory authorities or
    others regarding its status as a PRP in connection with sites
    found to require remediation due to the presence of
    environmental contaminants. In addition, the Company has been
    named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to
    such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot
    be predicted at this time, the Company does not expect, based on
    its experience to date, these matters, either individually or in
    the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.



CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other
    Proceedings

The Company is involved in other legal, environmental, tax and
    regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory
    commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising
    in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings
    involve substantial amounts. The Company regularly analyzes
    current information and, as necessary, provides accruals for
    probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these
    matters. The Company does not expect the disposition of these
    matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Guaranties

Prior to the Company’s distribution of its ownership in RRI
    to its shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary. Under
    the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI
    agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to
    separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI
    had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure the
    Company and CERC against obligations under the remaining
    guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for
    the benefit of CERC and the Company, and undertook to use
    commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining
    guaranties. CERC currently holds letters of credit in the amount
    of $33.3 million issued on behalf of RRI against guaranties
    that have not been released. The Company’s current exposure
    under the guaranties relates to CERC’s guaranty of the
    payment by RRI of demand charges related to transportation
    contracts with one counterparty. The demand charges are
    approximately $53 million per year through 2015,
    $49 million in 2016, $38 million in 2017 and
    $13 million in 2018. RRI continues to meet its obligations
    under the transportation contracts, and the Company believes
    current market conditions make those contracts valuable for
    transportation services in the near term. However, changes in
    market conditions could affect the value of those contracts. If
    RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the
    transportation contracts, the Company’s exposure to the
    counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security
    provided by RRI. The Company has requested RRI to increase the
    amount of its existing letters of credit or, in the alternative,
    to obtain a release of CERC’s obligations under the
    guaranty. In June 2006, the RRI trading subsidiary and CERC
    jointly filed a complaint at the FERC against the counterparty
    on the CERC guaranty. In the complaint, the RRI trading
    subsidiary seeks a determination by the FERC that the security
    demanded by the counterparty exceeds the level permitted by the
    FERC’s policies. The complaint asks the FERC to require the
    counterparty to release CERC from its guaranty obligation and,
    in its place, accept (i) a guaranty from RRI of the
    obligations of the RRI trading subsidiary, and (ii) letters
    of credit limited to (A) one year of demand charges for a
    transportation agreement related to a 2003 expansion of the
    counterparty’s pipeline, and (B) three months of
    demand charges for three other transportation agreements held by
    the RRI trading subsidiary. The counterparty has argued that the
    amount of the guaranty does not violate the FERC’s policies
    and that the proposed substitution of credit support is not
    authorized under the counterparty’s financing documents or
    required by FERC’s policy. The parties have now completed
    their submissions to FERC regarding the complaint. The Company
    cannot predict what action the FERC may take on the complaint or
    when the FERC may rule. In addition to the FERC proceeding, in
    February 2007 the Company and CERC made a formal demand on RRI
    under procedures provided for by the Master Separation
    Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2000, between Reliant
    Energy and RRI. That demand seeks to resolve the disagreement
    with RRI over the amount of security RRI is obligated to provide
    with respect to this guaranty. It is possible that this demand
    could lead to an arbitration proceeding between the companies,
    but when and on what terms the disagreement with RRI will
    ultimately be resolved cannot be predicted.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Fund Collections

Pursuant to regulatory requirements and its tariff, CenterPoint
    Houston, as collection agent, collects from its transmission and
    distribution customers a nuclear decommissioning charge assessed
    with respect to its former 30.8% ownership interest in the South
    Texas Project, which it owned when it was part of an integrated
    electric utility. Amounts collected are transferred to nuclear
    decommissioning trusts maintained by the current owner of that

interest in the South Texas Project. During 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    $2.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million,
    respectively, was transferred. There are various investment
    restrictions imposed on owners of nuclear generating stations by
    the Texas Utility Commission and the U.S. Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission relating to nuclear decommissioning
    trusts. Pursuant to the provisions of both a separation
    agreement and a final order of the Texas Utility Commission
    relating to the 2005 transfer of ownership to Texas Genco LLC,
    now NRG, CenterPoint Houston and a subsidiary of NRG were, until
    July 1, 2006, jointly administering the decommissioning
    funds through the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Investment
    Committee. In June 2006, the Texas Utility Commission approved
    an application by CenterPoint Houston and an NRG subsidiary to
    name the NRG subsidiary as the sole fund administrator. As a
    result, CenterPoint Houston is no longer responsible for
    administration of decommissioning funds it collects as
    collection agent.

    not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per
    share because the options’ exercise price was greater than
    the average market price of the common shares for the respective
    years.

In accordance with EITF

04-8,

because all of the 2.875% contingently convertible senior notes
    and approximately $572 million of the 3.75% contingently
    convertible senior notes (subsequent to the August 2005 exchange
    discussed in Note 8) provide for settlement of the
    principal portion in cash rather than stock, the Company
    excludes the portion of the conversion value of these notes
    attributable to their principal amount from its computation of
    diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. The
    Company includes the conversion spread in the calculation of
    diluted earnings per share when the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock in the respective reporting period
    exceeds the conversion price. The conversion prices for the
    2.875% and the 3.75% contingently convertible senior notes were
    $12.52 and $11.31, respectively, at December 31, 2006. All
    of the Company’s 2.875% convertible senior notes were
    either redeemed or surrendered for conversion in January 2007,
    as described in Note 8(b), “Long-term Debt —
    Convertible Debt.”

Quarterly earnings per common share are based on the weighted
    average number of shares outstanding during the quarter, and the
    sum of the quarters may not equal annual earnings per common
    share. The Company’s 3.75% contingently convertible notes
    are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
    for first and second quarters of 2005, as they are dilutive. In
    the third quarter of 2005, the Company modified approximately
    $572 million of the 3.75% contingently convertible senior
    notes to provide for settlement of the principal portion in cash
    rather than stock. Accordingly, the Company excludes the portion
    of the conversion value of these notes and the 2.875%
    contingently convertible notes attributable to their principal
    amount from its computation of diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations. The Company includes the conversion
    spread in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the
    average market price of the Company’s common stock in the
    respective reporting period exceeds the conversion price. All of
    the Company’s 2.875% convertible senior notes were
    either redeemed or surrendered for conversion in January 2007,
    as described in Note 8(b), “Long-term Debt —
    Convertible Debt.”

(14)  Reportable
    Business Segments

The Company’s determination of reportable business segments
    considers the strategic operating units under which the Company
    manages sales, allocates resources and assesses performance of
    various products and services to wholesale or retail customers
    in differing regulatory environments. The accounting policies of
    the business segments are the same as those described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies except that some
    executive benefit costs have not been allocated to business
    segments. The Company uses operating income as the measure of
    profit or loss for its business segments.

The Company’s reportable business segments include the
    following: Electric Transmission & Distribution,
    Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and
    Services, Interstate Pipelines, Field Services and Other
    Operations. The electric transmission and distribution function
    (CenterPoint Houston) is reported in the Electric
    Transmission & Distribution business segment. Natural
    Gas Distribution consists of intrastate natural gas sales to,
    and natural gas transportation and distribution for,
    residential, commercial, industrial and institutional customers.
    Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services represents the
    Company’s non-rate regulated gas sales and services
    operations, which consist of three operational functions:
    wholesale, retail and intrastate pipelines. Beginning in the
    fourth quarter of 2006, the Company is reporting its interstate
    pipelines and field services businesses as two separate business
    segments, the Interstate Pipelines business segment and the
    Field Services business segment. These business segments were
    previously aggregated and reported as the Pipelines and Field
    Services business segment. The Interstate Pipelines includes the
    interstate natural gas pipeline operations. The Field Services
    business segment includes the natural gas gathering operations.
    Other Operations consists primarily of other corporate
    operations which support all of the Company’s business
    operations. The Company’s generation operations, which were
    previously reported in the Electric Generation business segment,
    are presented as

discontinued operations within these consolidated financial
    statements. All prior periods have been recast to conform to the
    2006 presentation.

    unconsolidated subsidiaries. Intersegment sales are eliminated
    in consolidation.

On February 1, 2007, the Company’s board of directors
    declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per
    share of common stock payable on March 6, 2007, to
    shareholders of record as of the close of business on
    February 16, 2007.

In February 2007, the Company’s 8.257% Junior Subordinated
    Deferrable Interest Debentures having an aggregate principal
    amount of $103 million were redeemed at 104.1285% of their
    principal amount and the related 8.257% capital securities
    issued by HL&P Capital Trust II were redeemed at
    104.1285% of their aggregate liquidation value of
    $100 million.

In February 2007, the Company issued $250 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an
    interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying its
    $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the
    conversion and redemption of its 2.875% Convertible Notes.

In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an
    interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior
    notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of
    receivables under CERC Corp.’s $375 million
    receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased
    liquidity and capital resources for CERC’s general
    corporate purposes.

we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of
    our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our

    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding disclosure.

There has been no change in our internal controls over financial
    reporting that occurred during the three months ended

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of
    CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, and have issued our report thereon dated
    February 28, 2007 (which report expresses an unqualified
    opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the
    Company’s adoption of new accounting standards for defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006 and
    conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005), and
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 and the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, and have issued our report thereon dated
    February 28, 2007; such reports are included elsewhere in
    this

Form 10-K.

Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement
    schedules the Company listed in the index at Item 15
    (a)(2). These consolidated financial statement schedules are the

    responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In
    our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules,
    when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

CENTERPOINT
    ENERGY, INC.

SCHEDULE I —
    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (PARENT
    COMPANY)

(1) The condensed parent company financial statements and
    notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
    financial statements and notes of CenterPoint Energy, Inc.
    (CenterPoint Energy or the Company) appearing in the Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Bank facilities at CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and
    CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., indirect wholly owned
    subsidiaries of the Company, limit debt, excluding transition
    bonds, as a percentage of their total capitalization to
    65 percent. These covenants could restrict the ability of
    these subsidiaries to distribute dividends to the Company.

(2) Prior to repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
    Act of 1935, effective February 8, 2006, CenterPoint Energy
    was a registered public utility holding company under that act.

(3) In July 2004, the Company announced its agreement to
    sell its majority owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco
    LLC. In December 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its
    fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to
    Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the
    sale, Texas Genco distributed $2.231 billion in cash to the
    Company. Texas Genco’s principal remaining asset was its
    ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility. The final
    step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a
    subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash
    payment to the Company of $700 million, was completed in
    April 2005. The Company recorded after tax losses of
    $366 million and $14 million in 2004 and 2005,
    respectively, related to the sale of Texas Genco.

(4) In March 2006, the Company replaced its $1 billion
    five-year revolving credit facility with a $1.2 billion
    five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first
    drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
    60 basis points based on the Company’s current credit
    ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points for
    borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility contains
    covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    covenant.

Under the credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 10
    basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the
    facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR fluctuates based
    on the borrower’s credit rating. Borrowings under the
    facility are subject to customary terms and conditions. However,
    there is no requirement that the Company makes representations
    prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse
    changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material
    adverse effect. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject
    to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that
    the Company consider customary.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings and
    approximately $28 million of outstanding letters of credit
    under its $1.2 billion credit facility. Additionally, the
    Company was in compliance with all covenants as of
    December 31, 2006.

On May 19, 2003, the Company issued $575 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due
    May 15, 2023 with an interest rate of 3.75%. As of
    December 31, 2006, holders could convert each of their
    notes into shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock at a
    conversion rate of 88.3833 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time prior to maturity
    under the following circumstances: (1) if the last reported
    sale price of CenterPoint Energy common stock for at least 20
    trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter
    is greater than or equal to 120% or, following May 15,
    2008, 110% of the conversion price per share of CenterPoint
    Energy common stock on such last trading day, (2) if the
    notes have been called for redemption, (3) during any
    period in which the credit ratings assigned to the notes by both
    Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), a
    division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, are lower than Ba2 and
    BB, respectively, or the notes are no longer rated by at least
    one of these ratings services or their successors, or
    (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions, including the distribution to all holders of
    CenterPoint Energy common stock of certain rights entitling them
    to purchase shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock at less
    than the last reported sale price of a share of CenterPoint
    Energy common stock on the trading day prior to the declaration
    date of the distribution or the distribution to all holders of
    CenterPoint Energy common stock of the Company’s assets,
    debt securities or certain rights to purchase the Company’s
    securities, which distribution has a per share value exceeding
    15% of the last reported sale price of a share of CenterPoint
    Energy common stock on the trading day immediately preceding



the declaration date for such distribution. The notes originally
    had a conversion rate of 86.3558 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes. However, effective
    February 16, 2006 and November 17, 2006, the
    conversion rate increased to 87.4094 and 88.3833, respectively,
    in accordance with the terms of the notes due to quarterly
    common stock dividends in excess of $0.10 per share.

Holders have the right to require the Company to purchase all or
    any portion of the notes for cash on May 15, 2008,
    May 15, 2013 and May 15, 2018 for a purchase price
    equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes. The
    convertible senior notes also have a contingent interest feature
    requiring contingent interest to be paid to holders of notes
    commencing on or after May 15, 2008, in the event that the
    average trading price of a note for the applicable
    five-trading-day period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal
    amount of the note as of the day immediately preceding the first
    day of the applicable six-month interest period. For any
    six-month period, contingent interest will be equal to 0.25% of
    the average trading price of the note for the applicable
    five-trading-day period.

In August 2005, the Company accepted for exchange approximately
    $572 million aggregate principal amount of its
    3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 (Old Notes) for an
    equal amount of its new 3.75% convertible senior notes due
    2023 (New Notes). Old Notes of approximately $3 million
    remain outstanding. Under the terms of the New Notes, which are
    substantially similar to the Old Notes, settlement of the
    principal portion will be made in cash rather than stock.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, the
    3.75% convertible senior notes have been included as
    current portion of long-term debt in the Condensed Balance
    Sheets because the last reported sale price of CenterPoint
    Energy common stock for at least 20 trading days during the
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the fourth quarter of 2006 was greater than or equal to
    120% of the conversion price of the 3.75% convertible
    senior notes and therefore, during the first quarter of 2007,
    the 3.75% convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make
    them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of
    these notes.

On December 17, 2003, the Company issued $255 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due
    January 15, 2024 with an interest rate of 2.875%. As of
    December 31, 2006, holders could convert each of their
    notes into shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock at a
    conversion rate of 79.8969 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes. The notes originally had a
    conversion rate of 78.0640 shares of common stock per
    $1,000 principal amount of notes. However, effective
    February 16, 2006 and November 17, 2006, the
    conversion rate increased to 79.0165 and 79.8969, respectively,
    in accordance with the terms of the notes due to quarterly
    common stock dividends in excess of $0.10 per share. As of
    December 31, 2006, these notes were classified as current
    portion of other long-term debt in the Condensed Balance Sheets.

In December 2006, the Company called the 2.875% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2024 (2.875% Convertible Notes) for
    redemption on January 22, 2007 at 100% of their principal
    amount. The 2.875% Convertible Notes became immediately
    convertible at the option of the holders upon the call for
    redemption and were convertible through the close of business on
    the redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million
    aggregate principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes were
    converted. The $255 million principal amount of the
    2.875% Convertible Notes was settled in cash and the excess
    value due converting holders of $97 million was settled by
    delivering approximately 5.6 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock.

(6) CenterPoint Energy Intrastate Pipelines, Inc.,
    CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. and other wholly owned
    subsidiaries of CERC Corp. provide comprehensive natural gas
    sales and services to industrial and commercial customers which
    are primarily located within or near the territories served by
    the Company’s pipelines and distribution subsidiaries. In
    order to hedge their exposure to natural gas prices, these CERC
    Corp. subsidiaries have entered standard purchase and sale
    agreements with various counterparties. CenterPoint Energy has
    guaranteed the payment obligations of these subsidiaries under
    certain of these agreements, typically for one-year terms. As of
    December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Energy had guaranteed
    $128 million under these agreements.
