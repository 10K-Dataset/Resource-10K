Houston Electric T&D (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

Houston Electric is a transmission and distribution electric utility that operates wholly within the state of Texas and is a member of ERCOT. ERCOT serves as the independent system operator and regional reliability coordinator for member electric power systems in most of Texas. The ERCOT market represents approximately 90% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s largest power markets. The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards developed by the NERC, approved by the FERC and monitored and enforced by the Texas RE. The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the state’s main interconnected power transmission grid. Houston Electric does not make direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or own or operate any electric generating facilities.

Electric Transmission

On behalf of REPs, Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kV in locations throughout Houston Electric’s certificated service territory. Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT.


The ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Houston Electric’s transmission business, along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas, supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan, design, obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.

Electric Distribution

In ERCOT, end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs. Houston Electric’s distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lower-voltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer through distribution feeders. Houston Electric’s operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and call center operations. Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT. PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants. Rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT.

Bond Companies

Houston Electric has special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which it consolidates. These consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of Securitization Bonds, and conducting activities incidental thereto. The Securitization Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electric’s service territory. For further discussion of the Securitization Bonds and the outstanding balances as of

December 31, 2019

and


, see

Note 14

to the consolidated financial statements.

Customers

Houston Electric serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston metropolitan area. As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric’s customers consisted of approximately


REPs, which sell electricity to approximately

2.5 million

metered customers in Houston Electric’s certificated service area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electric’s certificated service area. Each REP is licensed by, and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by, the PUCT. Houston Electric does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers. It operates using a continuous billing cycle, with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day. For information regarding Houston Electric’s major customers, see

Note 19

to the consolidated financial statements. The table below reflects the number of metered customers in Houston Electric’s service area as of

December 31, 2019

:

Utility Technology

Houston Electric’s Smart Grid is comprised of the AMS, IG, ADMS and private telecommunications network. Houston Electric has deployed fully operational advanced meters to virtually all of its approximately

2.5 million

metered customers, automated 95 substations, installed 1,603 IG Switching Devices and other automation devices on more than 450 circuits, built a wireless radio frequency mesh telecommunications network across Houston Electric’s 5,000-square mile footprint, and enabled real-time grid monitoring and control, which leverages information from smart meters and field sensors to manage system events through the ADMS. The Smart Grid continues to improve electric distribution service reliability and restoration, enhance the consumer experience, support the growth of renewable energy and help the environment by reducing carbon emissions.

In addition, Houston Electric has implemented leading capabilities with customer service applications and mobile data applications including the PAS. The PAS notification tool alerts over 1.2 million registered customers of power delivery events at or near their home or facility via text, email or phone call.


Competition

There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electric’s service area. For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electric’s territory, it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT and, depending on the location of the facilities, may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities. Houston Electric is not aware of any other party intending to enter this business in its service area at this time. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electric’s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.

Seasonality

Houston Electric’s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP. Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes.

Properties

All of Houston Electric’s properties are located in Texas. Its properties consist primarily of high-voltage electric transmission lines and poles, distribution lines, substations, service centers, service wires, telecommunications network and meters. Most of Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law.

All real and tangible properties of Houston Electric, subject to certain exclusions, are currently subject to:

•

the lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) dated November 1, 1944, as supplemented; and

•

the lien of a General Mortgage (the General Mortgage) dated October 10, 2002, as supplemented, which is junior to the lien of the Mortgage.

For information related to debt outstanding under the Mortgage and General Mortgage, see

Note 14

to the consolidated financial statements.

Electric Lines - Transmission and Distribution.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric owned and operated the following electric transmission and distribution lines:

Substations.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric owned 236 major substation sites having a total installed rated transformer capacity of 68,053 Mva.

Service Centers.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric operated 15 regional service centers located on a total of 345 acres of land. These service centers consist of office buildings, warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business of transmitting and distributing electricity.

Franchises

Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its


electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 40 years.

Indiana Electric Integrated (CenterPoint Energy)

Upon consummation of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy added Indiana Electric Integrated as a new reportable segment. Indiana Electric Integrated consists of SIGECO’s electric transmission and distribution services, including its power generating and wholesale power operations. As of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric supplied electric service to the following:

System Load

Total load and the related reserve margin at the time of the system summer peak on September 12, 2019, is presented below in MW, except for reserved margin at peak.

The winter peak load for the 2018-2019 season of approximately 757 MW occurred on January 30, 2019.

Coal Purchases

Coal for coal-fired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby coal mines as there are substantial coal reserves in the southern Indiana area. Approximately 2.6 million tons were purchased for generating electricity during


. Indiana Electric’s coal inventory was approximately 664,000 tons as of

December 31, 2019

. The average cost of coal per ton purchased and delivered in


was $50.67. Since August 2014, Indiana Electric has purchased substantially all of its coal from Sunrise Coal, LLC.

Firm Purchase Supply

As part of its power portfolio, Indiana Electric is a 1.5% shareholder in the OVEC, and based on its participation in the ICPA between OVEC and its shareholder companies, many of whom are regulated electric utilities, Indiana Electric has the right to 1.5% of OVEC’s generating capacity output, which, as of

December 31, 2019

, was approximately 32 MWs. Per the ICPA, Indiana Electric is charged demand charges which are based on OVEC’s operating expenses, including its financing costs. Those demand charges are eligible to pass through to customers under Indiana Electric’s fuel adjustment clause. Under the ICPA, and while OVEC’s plants are operating, Indiana Electric is severally responsible for its share of OVEC’s debt obligations. Based on OVEC’s current financing, as of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric’s 1.5% share of OVEC’s debt obligation equates to between

$20 million

and $25 million, depending on revolving capacity commitments. Despite the bankruptcy proceedings of one of OVEC’s shareholders that holds a 4.9% interest under the ICPA, OVEC has represented it has both liquidity and financing capability that will allow it to continue to operate and provide power to its participating members, who include American Electric Power Company Inc., Duke Energy Corporation, and PPL Corporation. In 2019, Indiana Electric purchased approximately 121 GWh from OVEC. If a default were to occur by a member, any reallocation of the existing debt requires consent of the remaining ICPA participants. If any such reallocation were to occur, Indiana Electric would expect to recover any related costs through the fuel adjustment clause, as it does currently for its 1.5% share. In July 2019, the Ohio Legislature enacted House Bill 6, which provides for financial support to the members of OVEC serving Ohio customers.

In April 2008, Indiana Electric executed a capacity contract with Benton County Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 30 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton County, Indiana, with IURC approval. The contract expires in 2029. Indiana


Electric purchased approximately 71 GWh in


under this contract. In December 2009, Indiana Electric executed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 50 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton and Tippecanoe Counties in Indiana, with the approval of the IURC. Indiana Electric purchased approximately 126 GWh in


under this contract. In total, wind resources provided 4% of total GWh sourced in


.

MISO Related Activity

Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC approved regional transmission organization. The MISO serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission facilities as well as other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, where it bids its generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procures power for its retail customers at LMP as determined by the MISO market. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position. During


, in intervals when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO, the net purchases were 447 GWh. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, in intervals when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO, the net sales were 377 GWh.

Interconnections

As of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric had interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Duke Energy Shared Services, Inc., Indianapolis Power & Light Company, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 900 MW during peak load periods. Indiana Electric, as required as a member of the MISO, has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets to the MISO. Indiana Electric, in conjunction with the MISO, must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards. As a result, interchange capability varies based on regional transmission system configuration, generation dispatch, seasonal facility ratings and other factors. Indiana Electric is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by the NERC.

Properties

Generating Capacity.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric had

1,167

MW of installed generating capacity, as set forth in the following table.

(1)

SIGECO and AGC own a 300 MW unit at the Warrick Power Plant as tenants in common.


(2)

The Northeast Gas Turbines with 20 MW of combined capacity were retired in April 2019. Broadway Avenue Unit 2 with 65 MW of capacity was retired in December 2019.

(3)

Brown Unit 3 is also equipped to burn oil.

Electric Lines - Transmission and Distribution.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric owned and operated the following electric transmission and distribution lines:

(1)

These assets interconnect with Louisville Gas and Electric Company’s transmission system at Cloverport, Kentucky and with Big Rivers Electric Cooperative at Sebree, Kentucky.

Substations.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Indiana Electric’s transmission system also includes 33 substations with an installed capacity of approximately 4,900 Mva. In addition, Indiana Electric’s distribution system includes 81 distribution substations with an installed capacity of approximately 2,200 Mva and 55,727 distribution transformers with an installed capacity of 2,522 Mva.

Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD engages in regulated intrastate natural gas sales and natural gas transportation and storage for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers. See the detail of customers by state below.  CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD also provides unregulated services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales.

Upon consummation of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy added the legacy natural gas utility services of Vectren, which includes the natural gas utility operations of Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO and provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about 20% of Ohio, primarily in the west-central area. The Indiana and Ohio service areas contain diversified manufacturing and agriculture-related enterprises.

Customers

In


, approximately 35% and 39% of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s total throughput was to residential customers and approximately 65% and 61% was to commercial and industrial and transportation customers, respectively.


The table below reflects the number of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD customers by state as of

December 31, 2019

:

The largest metropolitan areas served in each state are Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; Lawton, Oklahoma; Evansville, Indiana and Dayton, Ohio.

Seasonality

The demand for natural gas sales to residential customers and natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal and affected by variations in weather conditions. In


, approximately 67% of CenterPoint Energy’s NGD’s total throughput and 69% of CERC’s NGD total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters. These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months.

Supply and Transportation.

In


, CenterPoint Energy’s NGD purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years. Certain contracts are firm commitments under five- and ten-year arrangements. Major suppliers are those that account for greater than 10% of CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s annual natural gas supply purchases. In


, CenterPoint Energy and CERC purchased 53% and 46% of their natural gas supply from four and three major suppliers, respectively. Numerous other suppliers provided the remainder of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply requirements.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD transports their natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions, varying from one to sixteen years. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to and/or filed with each of its state regulatory authorities. These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices (e.g., fixed price, costless collars and caps) with CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s physical gas suppliers. Their gas supply plans generally call for 50–75% of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion.

The regulations of the states in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD operates allow them to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas, including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the index-priced physical supply, to their customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in their tariffs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from monthly to semi-annually. The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD uses various third-party storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propane-air plant production.


As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s NGD owned and operated the following natural gas facilities:

The table below reflects CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD contracted upstream storage services as of December 31, 2019:

On an ongoing basis, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet their customer requirements. However, it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2023. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs.

Assets

As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD owned approximately 98,000 and 76,000 linear miles of natural gas distribution and transmission mains, respectively, varying in size from one-half inch to 24 inches in diameter.  CenterPoint Energy’s NGD in Indiana and Ohio includes approximately 22,000 miles of distribution and transmission mains, all of which are located in Indiana and Ohio except for pipeline facilities extending from points in northern Kentucky to points in


southern Indiana so that gas may be transported to Indiana and sold or transported to customers in Indiana. Generally, in each of the cities, towns and rural areas served by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD, they own the underground gas mains and service lines, metering and regulating equipment located on customers’ premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance. With a few exceptions, the measuring stations at which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD receives gas are owned, operated and maintained by others, and their distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment. These facilities, including odorizing equipment, are usually located on land owned by suppliers.

Competition

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers.

Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CERC offers competitive variable and fixed-priced physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities through CES and its subsidiary, CEIP, collectively, Energy Services.

In


, CES marketed approximately 1,305 Bcf of natural gas (including approximately 47 Bcf to affiliates) and provided related energy services and transportation to approximately

31,000

customers in over


states. CES customers vary in size from small commercial customers to large utility companies. Not included in the 2019 customer count are approximately

66,000

natural gas customers that are served under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility. These customers are not included in customer count so as not to distort the significant margin impact from the remaining customer base.

CES offers a variety of natural gas management services to gas utilities, large industrial customers, electric generators, smaller commercial and industrial customers, municipalities, educational institutions, government facilities and hospitals. These services include load forecasting, supply acquisition, daily swing volume management, invoice consolidation, storage asset management, firm and interruptible transportation administration and forward price management. CES also offers a portfolio of physical delivery services designed to meet customers’ supply and risk management needs. These services include (1) through CEIP, permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies and (2) through MES, temporary delivery of LNG and CNG throughout the lower 48 states, utilizing a fleet of customized equipment to provide continuity of natural gas service when pipeline supply is not available.

In addition to offering natural gas management services, CES procures and optimizes transportation and storage assets. CES maintains a portfolio of natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation and storage agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its customers. CES aggregates supply from various producing regions and offers contracts to buy natural gas with terms ranging from one month to over five years. In addition, CES actively participates in the spot natural gas markets to balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations. Natural gas supply and transportation capabilities are leveraged through contracts for ancillary services including physical storage and other balancing arrangements.

As described above, CES offers its customers a variety of load following services. In providing these services, CES uses its customers’ purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases, storage and transportation services to serve customers’ natural gas requirements. As a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity, CES will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers’ purchase commitments. These supply imbalances arise each month as customers’ natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by CES for delivery to those customers. CES’s processes and risk control policy are designed to measure and value imbalances on a real-time basis to ensure that CES’s exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum. The value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate VaR.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s risk control policy, which is overseen by CenterPoint Energy’s Risk Oversight Committee, defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits. CES is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools, including pipeline and storage capacity, financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts, to support its sales. CES optimizes its use of these various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading. CES currently operates within a VaR limit set by CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, consistent with CES’ operational objective of matching its aggregate sales obligations (including the swing associated with load following services) with its supply portfolio in a manner that minimizes its total cost of supply. Should CES exceed this VaR limit, management is required to notify CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors.


Assets

As of

December 31, 2019

, CEIP owned and operated over 210 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas. In addition, CES leases transportation capacity on various interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage to service its shippers and end users.

Competition

CES competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas marketers, including the marketing divisions of natural gas producers and utilities. In addition, CES competes with intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market areas.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy)

Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly-owned subsidiaries Miller Pipeline, LLC and Minnesota Limited, LLC. Infrastructure Services provides services to many utilities, including CenterPoint Energy’s utilities, as well as other industries.

Backlog represents the amount of revenue Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Infrastructure Services operates primarily under two types of contracts, blanket contracts and bid contracts. Under blanket contracts, customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services; however, the Company expects to be chosen to perform work needed by a customer in a given time frame. These contracts are typically awarded on an annual or multi-year basis. For blanket work, backlog represents an estimate of the amount of revenue that Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed in the next twelve months on either existing contracts or contracts it reasonably expects to be renewed or awarded based upon recent history or discussions with customers. Under bid contracts, customers are contractually committed to a specific service to be performed for a specific price, whether in total for a project or on a per unit basis.

Projects included in backlog can be subject to delays or cancellation as a result of regulatory requirements, adverse weather conditions and certain customer requirements, among other factors. Such delays or cancellations could cause realized revenue amounts to differ significantly from that which was originally expected.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Midstream

Investments (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment consists of its equity method investment in Enable. Enable is a publicly traded MLP, jointly controlled by CenterPoint Energy (indirectly through CNP Midstream) and OGE as of

December 31, 2019

.

On September 4, 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin of its equity investment in Enable, consisting of Enable common units and its interests in Enable GP, to CenterPoint Energy.  For further discussion of the Internal Spin, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Enable.

Enable owns, operates and develops midstream energy infrastructure assets strategically located to serve its customers. Enable’s assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) gathering and processing and (ii) transportation and storage. Enable’s gathering and processing segment primarily provides natural gas gathering and processing to its producer customers and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services to its producer and refiner customers. Enable’s transportation and storage segment provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to its producer, power plant, local distribution company and industrial end-user customers.

Enable’s Gathering and Processing segment.

Enable owns and operates substantial natural gas and crude oil gathering and natural gas processing assets in five states. Enable’s gathering and processing operations consist primarily of natural gas gathering


and processing assets serving the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins, crude oil and condensate gathering assets serving the Anadarko Basin and crude oil and produced water gathering assets serving the Williston Basin. Enable provides a variety of services to the active producers in its operating areas, including gathering, compressing, treating, and processing natural gas, fractionating NGLs, and gathering crude oil and produced water. Enable serves shale and other unconventional plays in the basins in which it operates.

Enable’s gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. Competition for crude oil, condensate, produced water and extracted NGL services also includes trucking and railroad transportation companies. In the process of selling NGLs, Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Enable’s primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where it operates. Enable’s management views the principal elements of competition for its gathering and processing systems as gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead.

Enable’s Transportation and Storage segment.

Enable owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems across nine states. Enable’s transportation and storage systems consist primarily of its interstate systems, its intrastate system and its investment in SESH. Enable’s transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, local distribution companies and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Enable’s transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers.

Enable’s interstate and intrastate pipelines compete with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines across its operating areas in providing transportation and storage services, including several pipelines with which it interconnects. Enable’s management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.

For information related to CenterPoint Energy’s equity method investment in Enable, see

Note 2

(c) and

Note 11

to the consolidated financial statements.

Corporate and Other Operations (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other Operations reportable segment consists of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects, through ESG, home repair protection plans through a third party and other corporate support operations that support CenterPoint Energy’s business operations. CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other Operations also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.

CERC’s Corporate and Other Operations reportable segment consists primarily of corporate operations which support all of the business operations of CERC and includes unallocated corporate costs and inter-segment eliminations.

REGULATION

The Registrants are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies, including the regulations described below. The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants’ businesses and CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable as of

December 31, 2019

.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

The FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA, as amended, to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales. The FERC regulates, among other things, the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of these facilities. The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERC-regulated transactions, to conduct audits and investigations, and to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment markets natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to blanket authority granted by the FERC.

Indiana Electric is a “public utility” under the FPA and is subject to regulation by the FERC. The FERC regulates, among other things, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, mergers, acquisitions and corporate transactions by electricity companies, energy markets, reliability standards and the issuance of short-term debt. The FERC also


has authority to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders. Houston Electric is not a “public utility” under the FPA and, therefore, is not generally regulated by the FERC, although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system (Electric Entities). The ERO and the FERC have authority to (a) impose fines and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply with approved standards and (b) audit compliance with approved standards. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE and in the MISO to ReliabilityFirst Corporation. Neither Houston Electric nor Indiana Electric anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will have a material adverse impact on their operations. To the extent that Houston Electric is required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards, it is anticipated that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT and the MISO, respectively, for electric transmission provided.

As a public utility holding company, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, CenterPoint Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances.

For a discussion of the Registrants’ ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

State and Local Regulation – Electric Transmission & Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

Houston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities. The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under cost-of-service rate regulation. Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 40 years.

Houston Electric’s distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered, whereas distribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand. All REPs in Houston Electric’s service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services. This regulated delivery charge includes the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal franchise fees), a distribution recovery mechanism for recovery of incremental distribution-invested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate, a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility, an EECR charge, and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets, stranded costs and restoration costs relating to Hurricane Ike. Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under “postage stamp” rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted. All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services.

With the IURC’s approval, Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC-approved regional transmission organization.  The MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission and generation facilities as well as those of other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market. Indiana Electric also receives transmission revenue that results from other members’ use of Indiana Electric’s transmission system. Generally, these transmission revenues, along with costs charged by the MISO, are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from or refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms.

For a discussion of certain of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.


State and Local Regulation – Electric Generation (CenterPoint Energy)

Indiana Electric owns and operates

1,000

MW of coal-fired generation,


MW of gas-fired generation and


MW of solar generation. Indiana Electric also is party to two purchase power agreements, entitling it to the delivery of up to 80 MW of electricity produced by wind turbines. The energy and capacity secured from Indiana Electric’s available generation resources are utilized primarily to serve the needs of retail electric customers residing within Indiana Electric’s franchised service territory. Costs of operating Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are recovered through IURC-approved base rates as well as periodic rate recovery mechanisms including the CECA, DSMA, ECA, FAC, MCRA, RCRA Mechanism and TDSIC. Costs that are deemed unreasonable or imprudent by the IURC may not be recoverable through retail electric rates. Indiana Electric also receives revenues from the MISO to compensate it for benefits the generation facilities provide to the transmission system. Proceeds from the sales of energy from Indiana Electric’s generation facilities that exceed the requirements of retail customers are shared by Indiana Electric and retail electric customers.

The generation facilities owned and operated by Indiana Electric are subject to various environmental regulations enforced by the EPA and the IDEM. Operation of Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are subject to regulation by the EPA and the IDEM as it pertains to the discharge of constituents from the generation facilities. For further discussion, see “Our Business — Environmental Matters” below.

State and Local Regulation – Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

In almost all communities in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD provides natural gas distribution services, they operate under franchises, certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 10 to 30 years, although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD expects to be able to renew expiring franchises. In most cases, franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive.

Substantially all of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD is subject to cost-of-service rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas, by those municipalities served by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD that have retained original jurisdiction.  In certain of the jurisdictions in which they operate, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital, earned returns on equity or actual margins realized.

For a discussion of certain of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

Department of Transportation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

In December 2006, Congress enacted the 2006 Act, which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act.  These programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety, and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration.

Pursuant to the 2006 Act, PHMSA, an agency of the DOT, issued regulations, effective February 12, 2010, requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines, but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines. Operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by August 2, 2011.  CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas distribution systems met this deadline.

Pursuant to the 2002 Act and the 2006 Act, PHMSA has adopted a number of rules concerning, among other things, distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities, requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs.  PHMSA also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective January 1, 2011.

In December 2011, Congress passed the 2011 Act. This act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions; required the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety; required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure; and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements. In 2016, the 2016 Act reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority, including the


ability to issue emergency orders, to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities, as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of as-yet-incomplete PHMSA actions required by the 2011 Act. Congress did not pass a bill reauthorizing PHMSA in 2019, and PHMSA is operating under a continuing resolution until a new bill is passed. PHMSA did receive federal funding for fiscal year 2020.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSA’s regulations, performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the facilities. In particular, the cost of compliance with the DOT’s integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas, may also affect the costs incurred. Implementation of the 2011 and 2016 Acts, or implementation of future acts, by PHMSA may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs. In addition, CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOT’s enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations.

Midstream Investments – Rate and Other Regulation (CenterPoint Energy)

Federal, state, and local regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services may affect certain aspects of Enable’s business and the market for its products and services, as discussed below.

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation

Enable’s interstate pipeline systems—EGT, MRT and SESH—are subject to regulation by the FERC and are considered “natural gas companies” under the NGA. Under the NGA, the rates for service on Enable’s interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. Rate and tariff changes for these facilities can only be implemented upon approval by the FERC. Enable’s interstate pipelines business operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural gas, the available supply and relative price of natural gas in the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions.

Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements

The EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA and the FPA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior as prescribed in FERC rules, which were subsequently issued in FERC Order No. 670. The EPAct of 2005 also amends the NGA, the FPA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC’s regulations, rules, and orders, of up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation. Should Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. In addition, the CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and other authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1.2 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA. These maximum penalty levels are also subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation.

Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Regulation

Intrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place. However, an intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates, terms, and conditions of such transportation service comply with Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERC’s regulations. Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every five years. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service, or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by the FERC and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as described under  “—Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements” above.


Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation

Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities Enable considers to be natural gas gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a natural gas  gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are natural gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations.

States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, anti-discrimination requirements, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Enable’s natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate.

Enable’s gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.

Interstate Crude Oil Gathering Regulation

Enable’s crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin transport crude oil in interstate commerce pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with FERC regulatory requirements.  Crude oil gathering pipelines that transport crude oil in interstate commerce may be regulated as common carriers by the FERC under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory or not conferring any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.

Intrastate Crude Oil and Condensate Gathering Regulation

Enable’s crude oil and condensate gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is located in Oklahoma and is subject to limited regulation by the OCC. Crude oil and condensate gathering systems are common carriers under Oklahoma law and are prohibited from unjust or unlawful discrimination in favor of one customer over another. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. Enable’s crude oil and condensate gathering results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.

Safety and Health Regulation

Certain of Enable’s facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. All natural gas transmission facilities, such as Enable’s interstate natural gas pipelines, are subject to PHMSA’s regulations, but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines. In addition, several NGL pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines.

Pursuant to various federal statutes, including the NGPSA, the DOT, through PHMSA, regulates pipeline safety and integrity. NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act which requires PHMSA to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines. If future DOT pipeline regulations were to require that Enable expand its integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operations.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants’ businesses as of

December 31, 2019

. The Registrants’ operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, steam electric generation systems and the facilities that support these systems, the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants’ business activities in many ways, including, but not limited to:

•

restricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;

•

limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species;

•

requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants’ operations or attributable to former operations;

•

enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and

•

impacting the demand for the Registrants’ services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.

To comply with these requirements, the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to, among other activities:

•

construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;

•

acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;

•

modify, upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment; and

•

decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to assess, clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and/or property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.

The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently anticipated. The Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations.

Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations, the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability. The Registrants cannot assure you that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues, laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants’ operations. The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations.

Global Climate Change

There is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change. As a result, from time to time, regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or


regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state, federal, or international level. Some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. One such rule, the ACE rule, which was finalized by the EPA in 2019, requires states to establish heat rate performance standards for steam electric generating facilities. Under the ACE rule, a state has three years to finalize its program and the EPA then has 18 months to approve, making compliance by Indiana Electric’s generating units required in 2023-2024.

Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Nevertheless, CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within Houston Electric’s service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants’ services. Conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gas-related businesses. At this point in time, however, it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions, either positive or negative, on the Registrants’ businesses.

To the extent climate changes may occur and such climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants’ or Enable’s service territories, financial results from the Registrants’ and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity for cooling. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes. Since many of the Registrants’ facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants’ financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants’ future financial results may be adversely impacted.

Air Emissions

The Registrants’ operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions. The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.

The EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGLs production, processing and transportation activities. Under the NESHAPS, the EPA established the RICE MACT rule. Compressors and back up electrical generators used by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD, and back up electrical generators used by CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, are substantially compliant with these laws and regulations. Similarly, the EPA also established the MATS rule, which sets emission limits for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from steam electric generating facilities. Indiana Electric’s generating units are in full compliance with the MATS rule.


Water Discharges

The Registrants’ operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The unpermitted discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants’ pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations.

Waters of the United States

Under the Obama administration, the EPA promulgated a set of rules that included a comprehensive regulatory overhaul of defining “waters of the United States” for the purposes of determining federal jurisdiction. The Trump administration signaled its intent to repeal and replace the Obama-era rules. In accordance with this intent, the EPA promulgated a rule in early 2018 that postponed the effectiveness of the Obama-era rules until 2020. Thereafter, the EPA proposed a new set of rules that would narrow the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, which were released in January 2020 and will become final upon publication in the Federal Register. Environmental stakeholders and certain states have indicated their intent to challenge the new rule and further litigation is likely. The potential impact of any new “waters of the United States” regulations on the Registrants’ business, liabilities, compliance obligations or profits and revenues is uncertain at this time.

ELG

In 2015 the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds.  These new standards are applied at the time of permit renewal and an affected facility must comply no later than December 31, 2023. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s ELG compliance plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, and Indiana Electric is currently finalizing its ELG compliance plan for the remainder of its affected units as part of its ongoing IRP process.

Cooling Water Intake Structures

Section 316 of the federal Clean Water Act requires steam electric generating facilities use “best technology available” to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water. In May 2014 EPA finalized a regulation requiring installation of BTA to mitigate impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in cooling water intake structures. Indiana Electric is currently completing the required ecological studies and anticipates timely compliance in 2021-2022.

Hazardous Waste

The Registrants’ operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.

Coal Ash

Indiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. In 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates coal ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be reused. Under the existing CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place. In March 2018, Indiana Electric began posting ground water data monitoring reports annually to its public website in accordance with the requirements of the CCR Rule. This data preliminarily indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric’s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing.The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18,


2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric is required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by August 2020. Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding, including the imposition of fines and penalties. For further discussion about Indiana Electric’s ash ponds, please see Note 16(e) to the consolidated financial statements.

Liability for Remediation

CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment. Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills. Although petroleum, as well as natural gas, is expressly excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of the Registrants’ ordinary operations they do, from time to time, generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a “hazardous substance.” CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Under CERCLA, the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released, for damages to natural resources, and for associated response and assessment costs, including for the costs of certain health studies.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC, SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company, the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries and its interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries.

Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition

CenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.

CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds all of its assets through, its subsidiaries, including its interests in Enable. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. For a description of these restrictions and further information on ring-fencing measures that may adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric as well as other financial impacts, please read “—The imposition of certain


ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations.”

Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, future growth and earnings and dividend goals depend on the performance of its utility and non-utility (such as CES, Infrastructure Services and ESG) subsidiaries which contribute to a portion of its consolidated earnings and which may not perform at expected or forecasted levels or do not achieve the projected growth in these businesses as anticipated. As part of their non-utility businesses, CenterPoint Energy and CERC also offer home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas and Louisiana (through a third-party provider) and provide home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota. For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives with respect to its interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects.”

CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy.

If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or

refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.

Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs, (iii) distributions from CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable and (iv) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common and/or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy.  We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy had $15.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $977 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on maturities through 2024, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;

•

volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;

•

investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;

•

the future performance of our and Enable’s businesses;

•

integration of Vectren’s businesses into CenterPoint Energy;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;

•

our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;

•

incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and

•

provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric had approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, up to 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately $3.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2019. However, Houston Electric


has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. As of

December 31, 2019

, SIGECO had approximately $293 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding. SIGECO may issue additional bonds under its Mortgage Indenture up to 60% of currently unfunded property additions. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately $1.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis. However, under certain circumstances Indiana Electric is limited in its ability to issue additional bonds under the Mortgage Indenture due to a provision in its parent’s, VUHI, indentures.

The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2019 and to date in 2020 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms.

The imposition of certain ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations.

As part of its most recent base rate proceeding, Houston Electric has agreed, as part of a settlement, to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. As part of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric and CenterPoint Energy are subject to various ring-fencing measures. For further information about the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. Additionally, further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. As a result of such ring-fencing measures, CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments.

The LIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021.  It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR reference rates become unavailable, any LIBOR borrowings under the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities would convert at the end of the applicable interest period to alternate base rate loans and any future borrowings thereunder would be made as alternate base rate loans. Alternate base rate loans generally constitute a higher cost of capital.

Certain of CenterPoint Energy’s credit and term loan facilities provide for a mechanism to amend such facility to reflect the establishment of an alternative reference rate upon the inability to determine the LIBOR-based Eurodollar rate or occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR. However, we have not yet pursued any technical amendment or other contractual alternative to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement or unavailability of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.

Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require CenterPoint Energy to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy has increased the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based on future adverse changes to the acquired businesses or general market conditions.


In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at their Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the carrying value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the fair value. As a result, CenterPoint Energy and CERC evaluated long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, for recoverability and the goodwill within the reporting units was tested for impairment as of December 31, 2019.  The long-lived assets within the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were determined to be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of December 31, 2019, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized an impairment loss of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) of their respective Energy Services reporting unit exceeded fair value as of December 31, 2019. Following the impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill remaining in the Energy Services reporting unit is $62 million as of December 31, 2019.  CenterPoint Energy did not recognize any impairments on its Infrastructure Services reporting unit in 2019.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit.  As a result, certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities. CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $85 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020. The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.

Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reporting unit. Certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities and certain assets and liabilities within the reporting unit that will be retained by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate recording an impairment loss, consisting of both goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, on assets held for sale of approximately $80 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.

For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if Enable’s common unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, CenterPoint Energy could determine that it is unable to recover the carrying value of its equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. Such an impairment occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price that year, among other factors impacting the midstream oil and gas industry. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s total investment in Enable is

$10.29

per unit and Enable’s common unit price closed at

$10.03

per unit (approximately

$61 million

below carrying value). Based on an analysis of its investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of its investment is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of

$2.4 billion

will be recovered. On February 24, 2020, Enable’s common unit price closed at $7.63 (approximately $622 million below carrying value). A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy again recording impairment charges in the future.

For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for as investments without a readily determinable fair value, such as the Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment, the carrying value of the asset may be adjusted to fair value, resulting in a gain or loss in the period, if a transaction on an identical or similar investment in Enable is observed.  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy considers qualitative impairment triggers, such as significant deterioration in earnings performance, significant decline in market condition and other factors that raise significant concerns about Enable’s ability to continue as a going concern, to determine if an impairment analysis should be performed on its investment.

Should the annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction, as described above, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.


Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.

CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.

CenterPoint Energy, through Infrastructure Services, also contributes to several multi-employer pension plans. If Infrastructure Services withdraws from these plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay an amount based on the allocable share of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits, referred to as the withdrawal liability. This could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.

The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through self-insured and insured plans. In recent years, the costs of providing these benefits per beneficiary increased due to higher health care costs and higher levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims. We anticipate that such costs will continue to rise. Further, the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts, which are likely to be passed on to us, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.

The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by the Registrants or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact the Registrants’ results of operations and those of Enable.

The Registrants use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks. The Registrants or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. Additionally, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows.

CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2019. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($75 million in the aggregate, or $5.28 per ZENS, as of

December 31, 2019

) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2019, deferred taxes of approximately $429 million would have been payable in 2019, based on 2019 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2019 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $149 million would have been payable in 2019. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns


or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.

Dividend requirements associated with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock that CenterPoint Energy issued to fund a portion of the Merger subject it to certain risks.

CenterPoint Energy has issued 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 19,550,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energy’s Series B Preferred Stock. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock.

The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock further provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.

Risk Factors Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.

Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. For Indiana Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan, which expires on December 31, 2023. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates, in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

For instance, on April 5, 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates, seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million, excluding a rider to refund approximately $40 million annually over three years. This rate filing was based on a rate base of $6.4 billion, a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE. Houston Electric also requested a prudency determination on all capital investments made since January 1, 2010; the establishment of a rider to refund approximately $119 million to its customers over three years resulting from the TCJA; updated depreciation rates; and approval to clarify and update various non-rate tariff provisions. After a five-day hearing in June 2019, and following the issuance of a PFD by the administrative law judges who heard the case, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. On February 14, 2020, the PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, which established rates based on a $13 million increase in annual revenues, a capital structure of 42.5% equity/57.5% debt and a 9.4% ROE. The Stipulation and Settlement Agreement requires Houston Electric to file another case within 48 months of the final order and removes the possibility that the deadline would be extended. For more information on Houston Electric’s base rate case, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.


The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For Houston Electric, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and distribution-related intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year and not during a comprehensive base rate proceeding.  In connection with the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed not to file its DCRF in 2020. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available to Houston Electric twice per calendar year. However, neither of these mechanisms provides for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses.

Similarly, for Indiana Electric, the TDSIC rate mechanism allows electric utilities (that have an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan) to request incremental rate increases every six months to pay for the projects included in that plan, subject to IURC approval. However, the TDSIC allows the utility to recover 80% of the costs as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred as regulatory assets to be recovered in the next base rate case. TDSIC rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues from the prior year. Indiana Electric recovers transmission costs through a FERC-approved formula rate and reflects charges and costs associated with participation in MISO through the MCRA mechanism, which is filed annually. Other non-fuel purchased power costs are recovered annually via the RCRA Mechanism. Electricity suppliers are required to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years. Indiana Electric recovers program and administrative costs of these plans, including lost revenues and financial incentives, via its annual DSMA mechanism. The DSMA is subject to IURC approval.

Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Unlike Houston Electric, Indiana Electric must seek approval by the IURC for long-term financing authority and by the FERC for its short-term financing authority. This authority allows Indiana Electric the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or the FERC do not approve Indiana Electric’s financing authority, Indiana Electric may not be able to fully execute its financing plans and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.

Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.

A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.


A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.

Indiana Electric’s execution of its IRP and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments, increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns.

Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years, unless extended, to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period on a periodic basis. Indiana Electric’s 2016 IRP modeling projects that the lowest cost and least risk generation portfolio to serve customers over the next 20 years involves retirement of a significant portion of its current generating fleet and replacing that generation capacity with other resources. Implementation of Indiana Electric’s IRP will likely require recovery of new capital investments, as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet, including any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets.  In February 2018, as part of its electric generation transition plan, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace certain existing generation capacity at an approximate cost of $900 million, which included the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the facility, among other things. While the IURC approved the construction of a 50 MW universal solar array and the plan to retrofit its largest, most efficient coal-fired generation unit (Culley Unit 3), the IURC denied Indiana Electric’s request to construct a 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility. The IURC urged Indiana Electric to utilize its next IRP planning cycle to evaluate the merits of a more diverse generation portfolio.

During the 2019 Indiana legislative session, certain proposed legislation would have prohibited the construction of new generation assets 250 MW or larger until 2021, among other prohibitions, by directing the IURC to not issue any final orders in proceedings requesting such construction. Although this proposed legislation was ultimately defeated, a similar moratorium on the construction of new generation assets in Indiana could be reintroduced in a subsequent legislative session. Legislation has been proposed in 2020 that would require IURC approval to retire coal-fired generation. This legislation, by its terms, would sunset in early 2021 and is not expected to impact Indiana Electric as currently drafted.

With respect to its upcoming IRP, Indiana Electric has conducted a request for proposals targeting 10 to 700 MW of capacity and unit-contingent energy and anticipates filing its 2019/2020 IRP in mid-2020. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP.  Depending on comments received on the IRP, the filing of any future requests for generating facilities could be delayed. Further, certain legislative activities such as the proposed moratorium in 2019 or other legislation restricting or delaying new generation could negatively affect Indiana Electric’s ability to construct new generation facilities and execution of its capital plan. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the construction of any new generation exist, including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements. Further, there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electric’s future filed petitions relating to its IRP.

Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash and/or other contaminants with a significant environmental impact. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. Currently, its coal supply is purchased largely from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.

Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards,


under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2019, Houston Electric did business with approximately


REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2019 was $192 million. Approximately 32% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.

Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Rate regulation of NGD may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.

NGD’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of NGD’s control. NGD has pending, or anticipates the filing of, rate cases in Indiana, Minnesota and Texas during 2020. NGD can make no assurance that these respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates, full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings could cause NGD to recover its investments at rates below its requested level, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions.

The rates that NGD is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede NGD’s ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by NGD.

Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, providing for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year. In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling program, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. Further, in Indiana, NGD may file a CSIA every six months to seek rate increases to recover certain federally mandated project costs (e.g., pipeline safety). The TDSIC (recovered


through the CSIA), allows the utility to recover 80% of its project costs associated with an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred until the next base rate case, and rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues. In Ohio, the DRR is an annual mechanism that allows a utility to recover its investments in utility plant and operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast-iron pipelines, as well as certain other infrastructure investments. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body.

In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year until a general rate case is filed. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five and a half years after the initial GRIP implementation date.

NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of NGD’s costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGD’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for NGD’s customers.

NGD depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of NGD’s natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If NGD is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGD’s requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in NGD’s service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect NGD’s businesses. Further, to the extent that NGD’s natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then NGD’s operations could be negatively affected.

NGD and CES are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of their suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

NGD and CES are subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact their businesses, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements. Increases in natural gas prices might affect NGD’s and CES’s ability to collect balances due from their customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which NGD and CES operate, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that NGD’s and CES’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral required under hedging arrangements. AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval, and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.


A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.

If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

NGD’s and CES’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.

NGD’s and CES’s revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Thus, their revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.

The states in which NGD provides service may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on NGD’s ability to operate.

From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which NGD does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.

These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on NGD’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for NGD and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.

NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

NGD and CES compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with NGD and CES for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by NGD and CES as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.

Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industries are competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Infrastructure Services and ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (e.g., federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for ESG), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services or ESG operate could adversely impact operating results.

Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts, some of which are fixed price. Other risks that could adversely affect Infrastructure Services include, but are not limited to: failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure; loss of significant customers or a significant decline in related customer revenues; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; changes in the timing of projects; the inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers; and changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas and state regulatory requirements that mandate pipeline replacement programs that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction and/or the project margin realized on projects. For ESG, other risks include, but are not limited to: discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs;


the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; and cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects.

In addition, Infrastructure Services has supported CenterPoint Energy’s utilities pursuant to service contracts.  In most instances, the ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance it will be able to obtain future service contracts, or that existing arrangements will not be revisited.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

ESG’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy.

In the normal course of business, ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy has and will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guaranties do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guaranties of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral.  Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guaranties.

Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (53.7% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of

December 31, 2019

), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP. As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors” that are applicable to Enable.

CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects or if it reduces its ownership in Enable.

Both CenterPoint Energy and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units. CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units.  For the Enable Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. Additionally, distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:

•

the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;

•

the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;

•

the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;

•

the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;

•

cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;

•

margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;


•

the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;

•

adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;

•

the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and

•

prevailing economic conditions.

In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:

•

the level and timing of its capital expenditures;

•

the cost of acquisitions;

•

its debt service requirements and other liabilities;

•

fluctuations in its working capital needs;

•

its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;

•

restrictions contained in its debt agreements;

•

the amount of cash reserves established by Enable GP;

•

distributions paid on the Enable Series A Preferred Units;

•

any impact on cash levels should any sale of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable occur, as discussed further below; and

•

other business risks affecting its cash levels.

Additionally, although it has no current plan to do so, CenterPoint Energy may also reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute any sale of Enable common units is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the timing, pricing and terms of any such sale.  Any sales of Enable common units CenterPoint Energy owns could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units. Further, CenterPoint Energy’s sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enable’s ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions. Any reduction in CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable and decrease income, which may adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its payment obligations and pay dividends on its Common Stock. Further, any sales of Enable common units would result in a significant amount of taxes due, which could also significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s determination to execute any sale. There can be no assurances that any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed. Any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses, including, in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount.  CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in its investment in Enable. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, including following certain changes in the methodology employed by rating agencies whereby the Enable Series A Preferred Units are no longer eligible for the same or a higher amount of “equity credit” attributed to the Enable Series A Preferred Units on their original issue date (referred to as a “rating event”), Enable has the option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from such redemption in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as the Enable Series A Preferred Units.


The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to CenterPoint Energy on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.

The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.

Enable is required to, or may at its option, redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.

As a holder of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, CenterPoint Energy may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Enable Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.

Additionally, Enable may redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units under certain circumstances, including following a rating event. Upon a rating event, the Enable Series A Preferred Units may be considered by Enable to be an expensive form of indebtedness.  If Enable does not have sufficient funds to exercise its option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units upon a rating event, then such inability could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.

CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.

Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP.  The board of directors of Enable GP is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by CenterPoint Energy, the president and chief executive officer of Enable GP and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable.

Although CenterPoint Energy jointly controls Enable with OGE, CenterPoint Energy may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject it to claims that CenterPoint Energy has breached its fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.

CenterPoint Energy and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP, as well as limited partner interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP.  CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units. Conflicts of interest may arise between CenterPoint Energy and Enable and its unitholders. CenterPoint Energy’s joint control of Enable GP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, CenterPoint Energy may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject CenterPoint Energy to claims that, in favoring its own interests and those of its affiliates, CenterPoint Energy breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders.

Enable is subject to various operational risks, all of which could affect Enable’s ability to make cash distributions to CenterPoint Energy.

The execution of Enable’s businesses is subject to a number of operational risks, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Contract Renewal

: Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected;

•

Customers

: Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers or the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation


and storage services and adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;

•

Third-Party Drilling and Production Decisions

: Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the natural gas and crude oil drilling and production market conditions and decisions of others, over which Enable has no control. Further, sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation and fluctuations in energy prices could lead to further reductions in the utilization of Enable’s systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. It may also become more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time;

•

Competition

: Enable competes with similar enterprises, some of which include public and private energy companies with greater financial resources and access to natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies, in its respective areas of operation, primarily through rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Increased competitive pressure in Enable’s industry, which is already highly competitive, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;

•

Cost Recovery of Capital Improvements

: Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2019

, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $160 million to $240 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $110 million to $130 million for the year ending December 31, 2020;

•

Commodity Prices

: Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Factors affecting prices are beyond Enable’s control and include the following: (i) demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, (ii) the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, (iii) actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, (iv) the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, (v) the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, (vi) the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and (vii) the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Further, Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2019, 4%, 26% and 70% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected;

•

Credit Risk of Customers:

Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers, whether through severe financial problems or otherwise, could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;

•

“Negotiated Rate” Contracts

: Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts, which are authorized by the FERC, that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform these services exceeds the revenues received from these contracts. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately 37% of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 93% of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT, was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts. The majority of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity and all of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity under negotiated rate contracts on MRT are subject to the FERC’s rate case approval. As a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under these contracts, and if Enable’s costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease;


•

Unavailability of Interconnected Facilities

: If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities (including those providing transportation of natural gas and crude oil, transportation and fractionation of NGLs and electricity for compression, among other things) become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; and

•

Land Ownership

: Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate, which could disrupt its operations or result in increased costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.

Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.

Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, CVR Energy, Inc., Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture.

Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:

•

Enable shares certain approval rights over major decisions and may not be able to control decisions, including control of cash distributions to Enable from the joint venture;

•

Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners, including leaving Enable liable for the other joint venture partners’ shares of joint venture liabilities if those partners do not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations;

•

Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;

•

Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;

•

Enable’s joint venture partners may take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and

•

disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.

The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.

Under certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s ownership interest in SESH at fair market value.

Enable owns a 50% ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50% ownership interest is held by Enbridge Inc. CenterPoint Energy owns 53.7% of Enable’s common units, 100% of the Enable Series A Preferred Units and a 40% economic interest in Enable GP. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, CenterPoint


Energy has a right to receive less than 50% of Enable’s distributions through its interests in Enable and Enable GP, or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.

Enable’s ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.

Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable’s cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.

To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.

Enable depends, in part, on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although it has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from operations. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.

Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.

As of December 31, 2019, Enable had approximately $4.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on their senior notes, $155 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $250 million outstanding under the Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission, LLC 6.25% senior notes due 2020, excluding unamortized premium. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with no borrowings outstanding, of which approximately $1.59 billion in borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2020, Enable had $119 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $1.63 billion of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:

•

the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;

•

a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;

•

Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and

•

Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.

Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.

Further, any reductions in Enable’s credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. Enable cannot assure that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a


rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable’s credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs, and Enable or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.

Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.

Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:

•

permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;

•

incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;

•

dispose of assets;

•

merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and

•

change the nature of its business.

Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.

Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.

Enable’s businesses are exposed to various regulatory risks.

Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:

•

Rate Regulation

: The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer.

•

FERC Revised Policy Statement and NOPR

: In a series of related issuances on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. On July 18, 2018, FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in a March 15, 2018 NOPR implementing the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with certain clarifications and modifications. For more information, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. If FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either its natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders. With regard to FERC-jurisdictional


rates on Enable’s crude oil pipelines, the FERC plans to address the Revised Policy Statement and corporate tax rate reduction in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index, which will occur in 2020 and become effective July 1, 2021. The potential rate impacts from the revision are currently uncertain.

•

Permits, Licenses and Approvals

: Enable may be unable to obtain or renew federal or state permits, licenses or approvals necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Further, to obtain new permits or renew permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to potential adverse impact of a proposed project. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable’s project construction schedules;

•

Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation

: Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas or crude oil production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; and

•

Jurisdictional Characterization of Assets

: Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under ICA. FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. Natural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.

Other Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses and/or CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP

The success of the Merger depends, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process.

The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe, including operating efficiencies, growth opportunities, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services. The integration process could be complex, costly and time consuming, including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto, and may result in the following challenges, among other things:

•

unanticipated delays, disruptions, issues or costs in integrating operations, financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;

•

inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;

•

differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and

•

loss of or difficulties retaining talented employees or valuable third-party relationships.

CenterPoint Energy must also successfully adapt its systems of internal controls to continue to accurately provide reliable financial reports, including reporting of its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If CenterPoint Energy’s efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls throughout integration are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, CenterPoint Energy’s operating results could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energy’s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities.


Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CenterPoint Energy may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits, including any expected revenue or synergy opportunities. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enable’s business, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems.

Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.

Cyber-attacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. Neither we nor Enable are fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

As domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of state-sponsored attacks, terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities, restore service  and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.

In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.

We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, steam electric generating facilities


and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

•

restricting the way we manage hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;

•

limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;

•

requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;

•

limiting airborne emissions from electric generating facilities, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO


), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO


) and mercury, and the disposal non-hazardous substances such as CCRs, among other things;

•

restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation;

•

imposing requirements on or restricting the operations of facilities under the terms of permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and

•

impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.

To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:

•

construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;

•

acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;

•

modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and

•

decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.

In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non­‑hazardous material under the RCRA. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to complete integrity assessments and groundwater monitoring studies. In January 2018, Indiana Electric completed its first annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. This report identified localized impacts to groundwater near Indiana Electric’s coal impoundments. Further analysis is ongoing. In October 2018, Indiana Electric completed the CCR Rule’s required evaluation of the placement of Indiana Electric’s coal ash ponds. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric must cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by August 31, 2020. Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow it to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to obtain these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including imposition of fines and penalties. Further, a release of coal ash that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of the environment could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs and reputational damage, all of which could adversely affect the financial condition of Indiana Electric.


The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.

Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.

In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in their respective businesses of gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, including:

•

damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties;

•

inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment;

•

leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;

•

ruptures, fires and explosions; and

•

other safety hazards affecting our operations.

These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enable’s operations.

Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.


Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.

Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:

•

operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;

•

the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;

•

operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;

•

labor disputes;

•

information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;

•

information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and

•

catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.

Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Our and Enable’s success depends upon our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.

We and Enable depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our and Enable’s success depends on our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. On February 19, 2020, our president and chief executive officer resigned from CenterPoint Energy. As a result of this departure, our board of directors is currently conducting a search to fill the role of chief executive officer. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our and Enable’s operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our and Enable’s management team, our and Enable’s future success depends in part on our and Enable’s ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our and Enable’s strategies.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our and Enable’s results of operations.

Our and Enable’s businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our and Enable’s costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our and Enable’s businesses. If we and Enable are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our and Enable’s results of operations could be negatively affected.

Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enable’s services, including certain local initiatives to prohibit new NGD service and increase electrification initiatives.

Regulatory agencies have adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and


internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.  Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.

In August 2018, the EPA proposed a CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized in July 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years to develop state plans to implement the ACE Rule, and we do not expect a state ACE plan to be finalized and approved by the EPA until 2024. We are currently unable to predict the effect of a state plan to implement the ACE Rule but do not anticipate that such a plan would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, the ACE Rule is currently subject to legal challenges.  At this time, we are unable to determine what effect, if any, the legal challenges will have on the ACE Rule.

Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, NGD’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Additionally, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses’ revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “— Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses —NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”

Moreover, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and NGD businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s NGD operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new NGD facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations.

Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enable’s businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.

A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or ice storms.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. Further, we may be subject to climate change lawsuits, which could result in substantial penalties or damages.

NGD and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.

Certain of NGD’s and Enable’s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The DOT’s PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a


leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including NGD and Enable, to, among other things:

•

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;

•

develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment;

•

identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area;

•

improve data collection, integration, and analysis;

•

develop processes for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication;

•

repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and

•

implement preventive and mitigating action.

Failure to comply with PHMSA or analogous state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on NGD’s and Enable’s operations. Both NGD and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations, which may not be recoverable in rates.

Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on NGD and Enable. Changes to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently. For example, PHMSA published a final rule in October 2019 that extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (e.g., period assessments, leak detection and repairs) regardless of proximity to a high consequence area. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us and Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.

Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.

We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Further, with respect to NGD’s operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.

Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described below:

•

The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 66 related to employees of Houston Electric is scheduled to expire in May 2020, for which negotiations are anticipated to begin in March 2020;

•

The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13-227 and 13-1 related to NGD’s employees in Texas are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and July 2022, respectively;

•

The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to NGD employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in April 2020, December 2020, May 2021 and March 2021, respectively, and negotiations with Gas Workers Union Local 340 are currently in progress and expected to be completed before the April 2020 expiration;


•

The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1393, USW Locals 12213 and 7441 related to employees of NGD in Indiana are scheduled to expire in December 2020;

•

The collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 135 and Utility Workers Union Local 175 related to employees of Indiana Electric were recently renegotiated and are scheduled to expire in September 2021 and October 2021, respectively; and

•

The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 702 related to employees of Indiana Electric is scheduled to expire in June 2022.

Additionally, Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations.  The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA.  These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborer’s International Union of North America, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, and Teamsters.  The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.  These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.

Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.

We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.

From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For


further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated.

Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated. As discussed in Note 16(d) to the consolidated financial statements, the existing CERC Corp. guarantees supporting CES’s obligations under natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts will not terminate upon closing of the transaction.  While the buyer has an obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause CERC Corp. to be released from the guarantees as of and following closing, if the buyer is unable to do so, CERC Corp. would continue to have significant exposure under the guarantees. Following closing, if CES were to default on the payment obligations still guaranteed by CERC Corp., CERC Corp. could be obligated for such amounts.

Further, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:

•

acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;

•

acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;

•

we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;

•

we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and

•

acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our or Enable’s ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.

The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results.

The Registrants could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that they have transferred to others.

Under some circumstances, the Registrants could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:

•

merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and

•

Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.

In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of the Registrants. Such indemnities have applied in various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time and cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets, including in the gas market manipulation cases described in Note 16(e) to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. However, because of the settlement and discharge of certain of GenOn’s indemnity obligations in 2019 in


its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the Registrants will no longer have the benefit of any settled or discharged indemnities and could incur liabilities in matters that previously would have been indemnified.

In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and CenterPoint Energy would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by CenterPoint Energy, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits CenterPoint Energy has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by CenterPoint Energy, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.

We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories and changes in customers’ perceptions from recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.

Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.

Declines in demand for natural gas in NGD’s territories due to recent pipeline incidents of other utilities and for electricity as a result of economic downturns in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.

For example, Houston Electric’s business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although Houston, Texas has a diverse economy, employment in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2019 among various sectors. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.  These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.

In the event economic conditions further decline, the respective rates of growth in Houston, Indiana and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Changing market conditions, including changing regulation, changes in market prices of oil or other commodities, or changes in government regulation and assistance, may cause certain industrial customers to reduce or cease production and thereby decrease consumption of natural gas and/or electricity. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition. Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.

We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and


negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We expect our and Enable’s businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.

Factors Influencing Our Businesses and Industry Trends

We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries. On February 1, 2019, we acquired Vectren for approximately

$6 billion

in cash. Through its subsidiaries, Vectren’s operations consist of utility and non-utility businesses. The utility operations include three public utilities, Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO, which, in the aggregate, provide natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly 67% of Indiana and about 20% of Ohio and electric transmission and distribution services to southwestern Indiana, including power generating and wholesale power operations. In total, these utility operations supply natural gas and electricity to over one million customers in Indiana and Ohio. The non-utility operations include Infrastructure Services and ESG. Infrastructure Services, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provides underground pipeline and repair services to many utilities, including our utilities, as well as other industries. ESG provides energy services through performance-based energy contracting operations and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects. ESG assists schools, hospitals, governmental facilities and other private institutions with reducing energy and maintenance costs by upgrading their facilities with energy-efficient equipment. ESG operates throughout the United States. Concurrent with the completion of the Merger, we added two new reportable segments, Indiana Electric Integrated and Infrastructure Services. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows, among other things, from our reportable segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. From an operational standpoint, we monitor operation and maintenance expense, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance.

The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.

To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. For example, Houston Electric is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country.  Despite Houston, Texas having a diverse economy, employment


in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2019 among various sectors. Although the Houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the eight states we serve.  Each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. Our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint.  In Minnesota, for instance, education and health services are  the state’s largest sectors, whereas Arkansas has a large food manufacturing industry. Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.  These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings; plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment; metal specialties; glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.

Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Long-term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. However, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed.To the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. Multifamily residential customer growth is affected by the cyclical nature of apartment construction. Beginning in 2019, a new construction cycle in Houston helped overall residential customer growth to return to the long-term trend of 2%. Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment is approximately 1%. CERC’s NGD customer growth was 1.3% for 2019, which is slightly higher than in previous years.

Performance of the Houston Electric T&D reportable segment and the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment is significantly influenced by energy usage per customer, which is significantly impacted by weather conditions. For Houston Electric, revenues are generally higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes. For CERC’s NGD, demand for natural gas for heating purposes is generally higher in the colder months. Therefore, we compare our results on a weather-adjusted basis.

In 2019, the Houston area experienced weather that was closer to normal compared to 2018. Although the summer months, particularly August and September, were hotter than normal, this was offset during the remaining months of the year due to milder than normal weather. While overall rainfall was higher than normal in 2019 largely due to Tropical Storm Imelda, it did not rise to the record rainfall levels experienced in 2017 that occurred largely due to Hurricane Harvey. After a return to more normal weather in 2018, our NGD service territories experienced warmer weather in 2019 in all areas except Minnesota.

Historically, both CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s NGD have utilized weather hedges to help reduce the impact of mild weather on their financial results. CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s NGD entered into a weather hedge for the  2018–2019 and 2019–2020 winter heating seasons in Texas where no weather normalization mechanisms exist. In CERC’s non-Texas jurisdictions, weather normalization mechanisms or decoupling in the Minnesota division help to mitigate the impact of abnormal weather on our financial results.

In Minnesota and Arkansas for CERC’s NGD, there are rate adjustment mechanisms to counter the impact of declining usage from energy efficiency improvements. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and Minnesota, as applicable to each registrant, we have benefited from growth in the number of customers, which could mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions’ economies continue to grow. The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and natural gas distribution rates.

Sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers by Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather. Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as these utilities have implemented conservation programs.

In our NGD Indiana and Ohio service territories, normal temperature adjustment and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. Our NGD operations in Ohio has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers. This rate design mitigates approximately 90% of the Ohio service territory’s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small


customer classes. While Indiana Electric has neither a normal temperature adjustment mechanism nor a decoupling mechanism, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that operates in tandem with conservation initiatives.

On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates. A settlement has been reached and a final order from the PUCT is expected during the first quarter of 2020. For details related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings and orders related to the TCJA in 2019 and to date in 2020, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

We believe the long-term outlook for ESG’s performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure opportunities remains strong with continued national focus expected on energy conservation and sustainability, renewable energy and security as power prices across the country rise and customer focus on new, efficient and clean sources of energy grows.

The regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s businesses. In accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations, CenterPoint Energy and CERC are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in their service territories, which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe, reliable and growing natural gas system. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations. Consequently, new rates in the areas they serve are necessary to recover these increasing costs.

Consistent with the regulatory treatment of pension costs, the Registrants defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in the Registrants’ base rates for the Electric T&D reportable segment and Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment in their Texas jurisdictions. CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately $83 million to its pension plans in 2020.

Factors Influencing Our Businesses Proposed for Divestiture

The Energy Services reportable segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers throughout the United States. The segment is impacted by price differentials on both a regional and seasonal basis, as well as fluctuations in regional daily natural gas prices driven by weather and other market factors. While this business utilizes financial derivatives to mitigate the effects of price movements, it does not enter into risk management contracts for speculative purposes and evaluates VaR daily to monitor significant financial exposures to realized income. Energy Services experienced instances of decreased margin in 2019 due to fewer opportunities to optimize natural gas supply costs as compared to 2018. Specifically, weather-facilitated market impacts in various regions of the continental United States during the three months ended March 31, 2018 allowed Energy Services to increase its margins in the first quarter of 2018. On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Demand for Infrastructure Services remains high due to the aging infrastructure and evolving safety and reliability regulations across the United States. The long-term focus for Infrastructure Services is recurring work in both the distribution and transmission businesses. The timing and recurrence of large transmission projects is less predictable and may create volatility in its year-over-year results.  On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Factors Influencing Midstream Investments (CenterPoint Energy)

The results of CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment are dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems. These volumes depend significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to Enable’s systems across a number of U.S. mid-continent markets. Aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities. Production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time.

Enable expects its business to continue to be impacted by the trends affecting the midstream industry. Enable’s outlook is based on its management’s assumptions regarding the impact of these trends that it has developed by interpreting the information currently available to it. If Enable management’s assumptions or interpretation of available information prove to be incorrect, Enable’s future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from its expectations.


Enable’s business is impacted by commodity prices, which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable’s systems. In addition, Enable’s processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. Enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges, focusing on contracting fee-based business and converting existing commodity-based contracts to fee-based contracts.

Enable’s long-term view is that natural gas and crude oil production in the U.S. will increase. Advancements in technology have allowed producers to efficiently extract natural gas and crude oil from tight gas formations and shale plays. As a result, the proven reserves of natural gas and crude oil in the United States have significantly increased. As proven reserves of natural gas and crude oil have continued to increase, the supply growth has outpaced demand growth, resulting in oversupply. The oversupply of natural gas and crude oil has resulted in price declines over the last year. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy demand in the U.S. Enable’s management believes that, although oversupply will continue in the near term, the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable over the long term and will be driven by population and economic growth, the continued displacement of coal-fired power plants by natural gas-fired power plants due to the price of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal and the continued development of a global export market for LNG. Enable’s management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term, both within the United States and in the global export market for LNG, will continue to drive demand for Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Compared to


Net Income.

CenterPoint Energy reported income available to common shareholders of

$674 million

(

$1.33

per diluted common share) for


compared to

$333 million

($0.74 per diluted common share) for


.

The

increase

in income available to common shareholders of

$341 million

was primarily due to the following key factors:

•

a  $395 million increase in operating income, discussed below by reportable segment in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment;

•

a $304 million increase in gain on marketable securities, included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;

•

a $20 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of the Securitization Bonds; and

•

an $8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below, partially offset by higher income before income taxes.

These

increases

were partially offset by:

•

a $167 million increase in interest expense, primarily as a result of higher outstanding long-term debt used to finance the Merger and additional long-term debt acquired in the Merger, discussed further in Notes 4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements;

•

an $82 million increase in preferred stock dividend requirements primarily as a result of the Merger;


•

a $77 million decrease to equity in earnings from the investment in Enable, which includes CenterPoint Energy’s share  ($46 million) of Enable’s goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 discussed further in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements; and

•

a $60 million increase in losses on the underlying value of the indexed debt securities related to the ZENS included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above.

Income Tax Expense

. CenterPoint Energy reported an effective tax rate of 15% and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The lower effective tax rate of 15% is due to an increase in the amount of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions, the effect of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes, and the impact of the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.


Compared to


Net Income.

CenterPoint Energy reported income available to common shareholders of

$333 million

(

$0.74

per diluted common share) for


compared to

$1,792 million

(

$4.13

per diluted common share) for


.

The

decrease

in income available to common shareholders of

$1,459 million

was primarily due to the following key factors:

•

an $875 million increase in income tax expense, resulting from a reduction in income tax expense of $1,113 million due to tax reform in 2017, discussed further in

Note 15

to the consolidated financial statements, offset by a $238 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to a reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the TCJA in 2018 and lower income before income taxes year over year;

•

a $305 million decrease in operating income, discussed below by reportable segment in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment;

•

a $281 million increase in losses on indexed debt securities related to the ZENS, resulting from a loss of $11 million from Meredith’s acquisition of Time in March 2018, a loss of $242 million from AT&T’s acquisition of TW in June 2018 and reduced gains of $28 million in the underlying value of the indexed debt securities;

•

a $48 million increase in interest expense primarily due to higher outstanding other long-term debt and the amortization of Bridge Facility fees of $24 million;

•

a $35 million increase in preferred stock dividend requirements; and

•

a $29 million increase in losses on marketable securities.

These

decreases

were partially offset by:

•

a $42 million increase in equity earnings from the investment in Enable, discussed further in

Note 11

to the consolidated financial statements;

•

a $25 million increase in interest income on investments included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;

•

a $17 million decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement costs included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;

•

an $18 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of the Securitization Bonds;

•

a $6 million increase in miscellaneous other non-operating income included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;

•

a $4 million increase in dividend income on CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS-Related Securities included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above; and

•

a $2 million increase in gains on interest rate economic hedges included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above.


Income Tax Expense.

CenterPoint Energy reported an effective tax rate of

28%

and

(69)%

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.  The effective tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as prescribed by the TCJA and the amortization of EDIT. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized prior to expiration after the Internal Spin. The effective tax rate was also increased for state law changes that resulted in remeasurement of state deferred taxes in those jurisdictions.

HOUSTON ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Houston Electric’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity. Houston Electric’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates Houston Electric charges, debt service costs, income tax expense, Houston Electric’s ability to collect receivables from REPs and Houston Electric’s ability to recover its regulatory assets.


Compared to


Net Income.

a $24 million increase in Other income (expense), net primarily due to increased interest income of $22 million mainly from investments in the CenterPoint Energy money pool;

•

a $14 million increase in TDU operating income discussed below in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment, exclusive of an $8 million gain from weather hedges recorded at CenterPoint Energy; and

•

a $9 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below,  partially offset by higher income before income taxes.

These

increases

to net income were partially offset by a $26 million increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding other long-term debt.

Income Tax Expense.

Houston Electric reported an effective tax rate of 18% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The lower effective tax rate of 18% is due to an increase in the amount of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators.

Note 15

to the consolidated financial statements, offset by a $60 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to a reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the TCJA in 2018; and

•

a $10 million increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding other long-term debt.

These

decrease

in net income were partially offset by the following:

•

a $5 million decrease in non-service cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement costs included in Other expense, net shown above; and

•

an $8 million increase in TDU operating income resulting from a $7 million increase discussed below in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment and increased usage of $1 million, primarily due to a return to more normal weather, which was not offset by the weather hedge loss recorded on CenterPoint Energy.

Income Tax Expense.

Houston Electric reported an effective tax rate of

21%

and

(2)%

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. The effective tax rate of

21%

is primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as prescribed by the TCJA and the amortization of EDIT. See

Note 15

to the consolidated financial statements for a more in-depth discussion of the 2018 impacts of the TCJA.

CERC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CERC’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and price movements of energy commodities as well as natural gas basis differentials. CERC’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various federal, state and local governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates CERC charges, competition in CERC’s various business operations, the effectiveness of CERC’s risk management activities, debt service costs and income tax expense.


Compared to


Net Income.

CERC reported net income of

$212 million

for


compared to

•

an $8 million decrease in income tax expense due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations ; and

•

a $6 million decrease in interest and other finance charges.


These

increases

were partially offset by a $138 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, discussed further in Notes 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Income Tax Expense.

CERC’s effective tax rate reported on income from continuing operations was 6% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The lower effective tax rate of 6% on income from continuing operations is due to an increase in the amount of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions, the effect of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes, and the impact of the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.

. Included in revenues by reportable segment below are intersegment sales, which are accounted for as if the sales were to third parties at current market prices. These revenues are eliminated during consolidation. See

Note 19

to the consolidated financial statements for details of reportable segments by registrant.

Operating Income (Loss) by Reportable Segment

(1)

Operating income for CenterPoint Energy’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment differs from operating income for Houston Electric due to weather hedge gains (losses) recorded at CenterPoint Energy that are not recorded at Houston Electric. Weather hedge gains (losses) of $6 million, $(2) million and $(1) million were recorded at CenterPoint Energy’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the weather hedge.

(2)

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

(3)

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.


Houston Electric T&D (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

The following table provides summary data of the Houston Electric T&D reportable segment:

(1)

Operating income for CenterPoint Energy’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment differs from operating income for Houston Electric due to weather hedge gains (losses) recorded at CenterPoint Energy that are not recorded at Houston Electric. Weather hedge gains (losses) of $6 million, $(2) million and $(1) million were recorded at CenterPoint Energy’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the weather hedge.

(2)

Operating income from the Bond Companies, together with $5 million, $4 million and $2 million of interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are necessary to pay interest on the Securitization Bonds.


Compared to


.

The Houston Electric T&D reportable segment reported operating income of

$624 million

for


, consisting of

$34 million

related to the Bond Companies. For


, operating income totaled

$623 million

, consisting of

$568 million

from the TDU and

$55 million

related to the Bond Companies.

TDU operating income

increased

$22 million

primarily due to the following key factors:

•

higher transmission-related revenues of $74 million, exclusive of the TCJA impact mentioned below, partially offset by higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $57 million;

•

decreased operation and maintenance expenses of $34 million, net of $10 million of Merger-related severance costs and $12 million of write offs for rate case expenses associated with the settlement of Houston Electric’s rate case, primarily due to lower labor and benefits costs and lower support services costs;

•

customer growth of $28 million from the addition of over 48,000 customers;


•

rate increases of $20 million related to distribution capital investments, exclusive of the TCJA impact mentioned below; and

•

higher miscellaneous revenues of $14 million primarily related to right-of-way revenues.

The increase in operating income was partially offset by the following:

•

lower equity return of $29 million, primarily related to the annual true-up of transition charges to correct over-collections that occurred during the preceding 12 months and due to the winding up of Transition Bond Company II;

•

higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily because of ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $26 million;

•

lower usage of $20 million due to lower residential use per customer and lower demand in our large commercial and small industrial classes in part due to less favorable weather in early 2019; and

•

lower revenue of $15 million related to the impact of the TCJA.

Lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to AMS of $28 million were offset by a corresponding decrease in related revenues.

increased

$7 million

primarily due to the following key factors:

•

higher transmission-related revenues of $37 million, exclusive of the TCJA impact, and lower transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $32 million;

•

customer growth of $31 million from the addition of over 41,000 customers;

•

rate increases of $36 million related to distribution capital investments, exclusive of the TCJA;

•

higher equity return of $32 million, primarily related to the annual true-up of transition charges correcting for under-collections that occurred during the preceding 12 months;

•

higher miscellaneous revenues of $9 million largely due to right-of-way and fiber and wireless revenues; and

•

higher usage of $8 million, primarily due to a return to more normal weather.

The

increase

to operating income was partially offset by the following:

•

increased operation and maintenance expenses of $79 million, excluding transmission costs billed by transmission providers, primarily due to the following:

◦

contract services of $24 million, largely due to increased resiliency spend and services related to fiber and wireless;

◦

support services of $23 million, primarily related to technology projects;

◦

labor and benefits costs of $14 million;

◦

other miscellaneous operation and maintenance expenses of $12 million; and

◦

damage claims from third parties of $6 million;

•

lower revenues of $79 million due to the recording of a regulatory liability and a corresponding decrease to revenue of $31 million reflecting the difference in revenues collected under customer rates at the pre-TCJA tax rate and the revenues


that would have been collected had rates been adjusted to the lower corporate tax rate upon TCJA enactment and lower revenues of $48 million due to lower transmission and distribution rate filings as a result of the TCJA; and

•

higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily because of ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $17 million.

Lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to AMS of $21 million were offset by a corresponding decrease in related revenues.

•

a $30 million increase in revenues for weather and usage, partially driven by the timing of a decoupling mechanism in Minnesota in CERC’s NGD service territory;

•

a $14 million increase in revenues associated with customer growth from the addition of over 42,000 new customers in CERC’s NGD service territories;

•

a $12 million increase in rates, exclusive of the TCJA impacts discussed below, from rate filings in CERC’s NGD service territories; and

•

a $6 million increase in revenue due to a reduction in TCJA-related revenue offsets that were recorded in 2018 in CERC’s NGD service territories.

The increase in operating income was partially offset by the following:

•

increased depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million, due to ongoing additions to plant-in-service in CERC’s NGD service territories; and

•

higher operation and maintenance expenses of $1 million, consisting of $10 million of Merger-related severance and incentive compensation costs associated with CERC’s NGD, which were offset by a $9 million decline in materials and supplies, contracts and services and bad debt expenses.


Decreased operation and maintenance expense related to energy efficiency programs of $14 million and increased other taxes expense related to gross receipt taxes of $2 million were offset by a corresponding decrease and increase in the related revenues in CERC’s NGD service territories, respectively.

support services expenses of $16 million, primarily related to technology projects;

◦

and other miscellaneous operation and maintenance expenses of $10 million;

•

higher labor and benefits costs of $30 million, resulting from the recording in 2017 of regulatory assets (and a corresponding reduction in expense) to recover $16 million of prior post-retirement expenses in future rates established in the Texas Gulf rate order and additional maintenance activities;

•

increased depreciation and amortization expense of $17 million, primarily due to ongoing additions to plant-in-service;

•

decreased revenue of $10 million, primarily driven by timing of weather normalization adjustments; and

•

higher other taxes of $2 million, primarily due to higher property taxes.

The

decrease

in operating income was partially offset by:

•

rate increases of $46 million, primarily in the Texas, Minnesota and Arkansas jurisdictions, exclusive of the TCJA impact discussed above;

•

an increase in non-volumetric revenues of $10 million; and

•

a $10 million increase associated with customer growth from the addition of over 36,000 customers.

Increased operation and maintenance expense related to energy efficiency programs of $10 million and increased other taxes expense related to gross receipt taxes of $7 million were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues.

The increase in operating income was partially offset by the following:

•

a $48 million goodwill impairment charge. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information; and

•

a $22 million decrease in margin due to fewer opportunities to optimize natural gas costs relative to 2018, primarily in the first quarter of 2019. Weather-driven market impacts in various regions of the continental United States provided increased margins during  the first quarter of 2018 which were not repeated in 2019.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment.

Future Sources and Uses of Cash

The liquidity and capital requirements of the Registrants are affected primarily by results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for electric and natural gas distribution operations. These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety, increase resiliency and expand our systems through value-added projects.  In addition to dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, and in addition to interest payments on debt, the Registrants’ principal anticipated cash requirements for


include the following:

The Registrants expect that anticipated


cash needs will be met with borrowings under their credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, term loans or common stock, anticipated cash flows from operations, with respect to CenterPoint Energy and CERC, proceeds from commercial paper and with respect to CenterPoint Energy, distributions from Enable.  Additionally, proceeds from the expected closing of the transactions underlying the Securities Purchase Agreement and Equity Purchase Agreement will be used to repay outstanding debt. Discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity securities of CenterPoint Energy or debt securities of the Registrants in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities or term bank loans. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available on acceptable terms.

Regulatory Matters

Houston Electric Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates, seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million, excluding a rider to refund approximately $40 million annually over three years discussed below. This rate filing is based on a rate base of $6.4 billion, a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE. Houston Electric last filed for a base rate increase on June 30, 2010, with a test year ending December 31, 2009. Houston Electric also requested a prudency determination on all capital investments made since January 1, 2010, the establishment of a rider to refund over three years to its customers approximately $119 million of unprotected EDIT resulting from the TCJA, updated depreciation rates and approval to clarify and update various non-rate tariff provisions. Recovery of all reasonable and necessary rate case expenses for this case and certain prior rate case proceedings were severed into a separate proceeding. A hearing was held June 24–28, 2019.

On September 16, 2019, the ALJs issued a PFD. The PUCT began deliberating on the PFD (which is prepared by ALJs at a different state agency) during its November 14, 2019 open meeting but delayed final determination for further consideration.  The PUCT again discussed the Houston Electric rate case at its December 13, 2019 open meeting and concluded that the PUCT would consider settlement a reasonable approach to resolving the rate case and noted that Houston Electric had indicated settlement negotiations were already underway. Houston Electric updated the PUCT at its January 16, 2020 open meeting regarding the status of settlement discussions, indicating that the parties were working on a settlement and anticipated a final settlement in the near future. On January 23, 2020, Houston Electric filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the PUCT that provides for the following, among other things:

•

an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million;

•

an ROE of 9.4%;

•

a capital structure of 57.5% debt/42.5% equity;

•

a refund of unprotected EDIT of $105 million plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and

•

recovery of all retail transmission related costs through the TCRF.

Also, Houston Electric is not required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its TCOS and DCRF mechanisms. Future TCOS filings will take into account both ADFIT and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding. No rate base items are required to be written off; however, approximately $12 million in rate case expenses were written off in 2019. A base rate application must be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order in the proceeding. Additionally, Houston Electric will not file a DCRF in 2020, nor will a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets.

Furthermore, under the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed to adopt certain ring-fencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy, which include the following:

•

Houston Electric’s credit agreements and indentures shall not contain cross-default provisions by which a default by CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates would cause a default at Houston Electric;


•

The financial covenant in Houston Electric’s credit agreement shall not be related to any entity other than Houston Electric.  Houston Electric shall not include in its debt or credit agreements any financial covenants or rating agency triggers related to any entity other than Houston Electric;

•

Houston Electric shall not pledge its assets in respect of or guarantee any debt or obligation of any of its affiliates. Houston Electric shall not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, or grant a lien upon the property of Houston Electric except pursuant to an exception in effect in Houston Electric’s current credit agreement, such as Houston Electric’s first mortgage and general mortgage;

•

Houston Electric shall maintain its own stand-alone credit facility, and Houston Electric shall not share its credit facility with any regulated or unregulated affiliate;

•

Houston Electric shall maintain ratings with all three major credit ratings agencies;

•

Houston Electric shall maintain a stand-alone credit rating;

•

Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds shall be secured only with assets of Houston Electric;

•

No Houston Electric assets may be used to secure the debt of CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates;

•

Houston Electric shall not hold out its credit as being available to pay the debt of any affiliates (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Houston Electric is not considered to be holding its credit out to pay the debt of affiliates, or in breach of any other ring-fencing measure, with respect to the $68 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds that currently serve as collateral for certain outstanding CenterPoint Energy pollution control bonds);

•

Without prior approval of the PUCT, neither CenterPoint Energy nor any affiliate of CenterPoint Energy (excluding Houston Electric) may incur, guarantee, or pledge assets in respect of any incremental new debt that is dependent on: (1) the revenues of Houston Electric in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of CenterPoint Energy; or (2) the equity of Houston Electric;

•

Houston Electric shall not transfer any material assets or facilities to any affiliates, other than a transfer that is on an arm’s length basis consistent with the PUCT’s affiliate standards applicable to Houston Electric;

•

Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not commingle its assets with those of other CenterPoint Energy affiliates;

•

Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not lend money to or borrow money from CenterPoint Energy; and

•

Houston Electric shall notify the PUCT if its issuer credit rating or corporate credit rating as rated by any of the three major rating agencies falls below investment grade.

The PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement at its February 14, 2020 open meeting. A final order from the PUCT is currently expected during the first quarter of 2020; however, motions for rehearing, if granted, could result in the order being issued after the first quarter of 2020. The rates are expected to be implemented 45 days after the final order is issued.

CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric record pre-tax expense for (i) probable disallowances of capital investments and (ii) customer refund obligations and costs deferred in regulatory assets when the amounts are no longer considered probable of recovery.

Brazos Valley Connection Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

Houston Electric completed construction on and energized the Brazos Valley Connection in March 2018, ahead of the original June 1, 2018 energization date. The final capital costs of the project reported to the PUCT in December 2018 were $281 million, which was within the estimated range of approximately $270-$310 million in the PUCT’s original order. In a filing with the PUCT in September 2018, Houston Electric applied for interim recovery of project costs incurred through July 31, 2018, which were not previously included in rates. Houston Electric received approval for interim recovery in November 2018. Final approval of the project costs occurred in Houston Electric’s base rate case discussed above.


Bailey to Jones Creek Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

In April 2017, Houston Electric submitted a proposal to ERCOT requesting its endorsement of the Bailey to Jones Creek Project. On December 12, 2017, Houston Electric received approval from ERCOT. In September 2018, Houston Electric filed a certificate of convenience and necessity application with the PUCT that included capital cost estimates for the project that ranged from approximately $482-$695 million, which were higher than the initial cost estimates. The revised project cost estimates include additional costs associated with the routing of the line to mitigate environmental and other land use impacts and structure design to address soil and coastal wind conditions. The actual capital costs of the project will depend on those factors as well as other factors, including land acquisition costs, construction costs and the ultimate route approved by the PUCT. On the request of the PUCT, ERCOT intervened in the proceeding and performed a re-evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project. Based on that re-evaluation, ERCOT reaffirmed the recommended transmission option for the project. An unopposed settlement agreement was filed on August 15, 2019, under which Houston Electric would construct the project at an estimated cost of approximately $483 million. The PUCT issued its final approval of the certificate of convenience and necessity application on November 21, 2019. Houston Electric has commenced pre-construction activities on the project, and anticipates beginning construction in early 2021 and energizing the line in early 2022.

Indiana Electric Generation Project (CenterPoint Energy)

Indiana Electric must make substantial investments in its generation resources in the near term to comply with environmental regulations. On February 20, 2018, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace the baseload capacity of its existing generation fleet at an approximate cost of $900 million, which includes the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the plant.

As a part of this same proceeding, Indiana Electric also sought recovery under Indiana Senate Bill 251 of costs to be incurred for environmental investments to be made at its F.B. Culley generating plant to comply with ELG and CCR rules. The F.B. Culley investments, estimated to be approximately $95 million, began in 2019 and will allow the F.B. Culley Unit 3 generating facility to comply with environmental requirements and continue to provide generating capacity to Indiana Electric’s customers. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric sought authority to recover 80% of the approved costs, including a return, using a tracking mechanism, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding.

On April 24, 2019, the IURC issued an order approving the environmental investments proposed for the F.B. Culley generating facility, along with recovery of prior pollution control investments made in 2014. The order denied the proposed gas combined cycle generating facility. Indiana Electric is conducting a new IRP, expected to be completed in mid-2020, to identify an appropriate investment of capital in its generation fleet to satisfy the needs of its customers and comply with environmental regulations.

Indiana Electric Solar Project (CenterPoint Energy)

On February 20, 2018, Indiana Electric announced it was finalizing details to install an additional 50 MW of universal solar energy, consistent with its IRP, with a petition seeking authority to recover costs associated with the project pursuant to Indiana Senate Bill 29. Indiana Electric filed a settlement agreement with the intervening parties whereby the energy produced by the solar farm would be set at a fixed market rate over the life of the investment and recovered within Indiana Electric’s CECA mechanism. On March 20, 2019, the IURC approved the settlement. Indiana Electric reached an agreement with the other settling parties to amend the settlement agreement to ensure the project would not cause negative tax consequences. Indiana Electric filed the amended settlement agreement with the IURC on September 16, 2019, and on January 29, 2020 the IURC approved the amended settlement agreement.

Indiana Electric A.B. Brown Ash Pond Remediation (CenterPoint Energy)

On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed a petition with the IURC, seeking approval, as a federally mandated project, for the recovery of costs associated with the clean closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond pursuant to Indiana Senate Bill 251. This project, expected to last approximately 14 years, would result in the full excavation and recycling of the ponded ash through agreements with a beneficial reuse entity, totaling approximately $160 million. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric seeks authority to recover via a tracking mechanism 80% of the approved costs, with a return on eligible capital investments needed to allow for the extraction of the ponded ash, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding. On December 19, 2019 and subsequently on January 10, 2020, Indiana Electric filed a settlement agreement with the intervening parties whereby the costs would be recovered as requested, with an additional commitment by Indiana Electric to offset the federally mandated costs by at least $25 million, representing a combination of total cash proceeds received from the


ash reuser and total insurance proceeds to be received from Indiana Electric’s insurers in confidential settlement agreements in the pending Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief filing. The settlement agreement is pending before the IURC, with an order expected in the first half of 2020. If approved, Indiana Electric would expect recovery of the approved costs to commence in 2021.

Rate Change Applications

The Registrants are routinely involved in rate change applications before state regulatory authorities. Those applications include general rate cases, where the entire cost of service of the utility is assessed and reset. In addition, Houston Electric is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms (TCOS and DCRF) and annually files to adjust its EECRF. CERC is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Texas (GRIP), its cost of service adjustments in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma (FRP, RSP, RRA and PBRC, respectively), its decoupling mechanism in Minnesota, and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi and Oklahoma (EECR, CIP, EECR and EECR, respectively). CenterPoint Energy is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Indiana (CSIA for gas and TDSIC for Electric) and Ohio (DRR), its decoupling mechanism in Indiana (SRC for gas), and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Indiana (EEFC for gas and DSMA for electric) and Ohio (EEFR).

The table below reflects significant applications pending or completed during


and to date in


for the Registrants.

Represents proposed increases (decreases) when effective date and/or approval date is not yet determined. Approved rates could differ materially from proposed rates.

Tax Reform

TCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds are currently included in the Registrants’ existing rates and are therefore reducing the Registrants’ current annual revenue. The TCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds for Houston Electric were completed in September 2019. However, in Houston Electric’s rate case filed in April 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric will return unprotected EDIT net regulatory liability balance to customers, through a separate rider and its wholesale transmission tariff over approximately three years. The balance of unprotected EDIT was $105 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, Houston Electric’s TCJA-related protected EDIT balance as of December 31, 2018 is $563 million and must be returned to customers over ARAM.

CenterPoint Energy’s electric and natural gas utilities in Indiana and Ohio, which were acquired during the Merger, currently recover corporate income tax expense in approved rates charged to customers. The IURC and the PUCO both issued orders which initiated proceedings to investigate the impact of the TCJA on utility companies and customers within Indiana and Ohio, respectively. In addition, the IURC and PUCO have ordered each utility to establish regulatory liabilities to record all estimated impacts of tax reform starting January 1, 2018 until the date when rates are adjusted to capture these impacts. In Indiana, in response to Vectren’s pre-Merger filing for proposed changes to its rates and charges to consider the impact of the lower federal income tax rates, the IURC approved an initial reduction to current rates and charges, effective June 1, 2018, to capture the immediate impact of the lower corporate federal income tax rate. The refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities commenced in November 2018 for Indiana electric customers and in January 2019 for Indiana gas customers. In Ohio, the initial rate reduction to current rates and charges became effective upon conclusion of its pending base rate case  on August 28, 2019. In January 2019, an application was filed with PUCO in compliance with its October 2018 order requiring utilities to file for a request to adjust rates to reflect the impact of the TCJA, requesting authority to implement a rider to flow back to customers the tax benefits realized under the TCJA, including the refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities. CenterPoint Energy expects this proceeding to be approved in 2020.


ELG (CenterPoint Energy)

Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA sets technology-based guidelines for water discharges from new and existing electric generation facilities. In September 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric ELG setting stringent technology-based water discharge limits for the electric power industry. The EPA focused this rulemaking on wastewater generated primarily by pollution control equipment necessitated by the comprehensive air regulations, specifically setting strict water discharge limits for arsenic, mercury and selenium for scrubber waste waters. The ELG will be implemented when existing water discharge permits for the plants are renewed. In the case of Indiana Electric’s water discharge permits, in 2017 the IDEM issued final renewals for the F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown power plants. IDEM agreed that units identified for retirement by December 2023 would not be required to install new treatment technology to meet ELG, and approved a 2020 compliance date for dry bottom ash and a 2023 compliance date for flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment standards for the remaining coal-fired unit at F.B. Culley.

On April 13, 2017, as part of the U.S. President’s Administration’s regulatory reform initiative, which is focused on the number and nature of regulations, the EPA granted petitions to reconsider the ELG rule, and indicated it would stay the current implementation deadlines in the rule during the pendency of the reconsideration. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing certain interim compliance dates by two years, but did not postpone the final compliance deadline of December 31, 2023. In April 2018, the EPA published an effluent guidelines program plan that anticipated a December 2019 rule revising the effluent limitations and pre-treatment standards for existing sources in the 2015 rule. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the ELG rule that selected impoundment as the best available technology for legacy wastewater and leachate. It is not clear what revisions to the ELG rule the EPA will implement, or what effect those revisions may have. As Indiana Electric does not currently have short-term ELG implementation deadlines in its recently renewed wastewater discharge permits, it does not anticipate immediate impacts from the EPA’s two-year extension of preliminary implementation deadlines due to the longer compliance time frames granted by IDEM and will continue to work with IDEM to evaluate further implementation plans. On November 4, 2019, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of proposed revisions to the CCR and ELG rules. CenterPoint Energy will evaluate the proposals to determine potential impacts to current compliance plans for its A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley generating stations.

CPP and ACE Rule (CenterPoint Energy)

On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its CPP Rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the U.S. Supreme Court staying implementation of the rule. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published its proposed CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized on July 8, 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years to develop state plans to implement the ACE rule, and CenterPoint Energy does not expect a state ACE rule to be finalized and approved by the EPA until 2024. CenterPoint Energy is currently unable to predict the effect of a state plan to implement the ACE rule but does not anticipate that such a plan would have a material effect.

Impact of Legislative Actions & Other Initiatives (CenterPoint Energy)

At this time, compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in GHG emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. While the requirements of a state ACE rule remain uncertain, Indiana Electric will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its electric generating units.

FERC Revised Policy Statement (CenterPoint Energy)

The regulation of midstream energy infrastructure assets has a significant impact on Enable’s business. For example, Enable’s interstate natural gas transportation and storage assets are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA. In March 2018, the FERC announced a Revised Policy Statement stating that it would no longer allow pipelines organized as a master limited partnership to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. In July 2018, the FERC issued new regulations which required all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information. In October 2018, Enable Gas Transmission, LLC filed its Form No. 501-G and filed a statement that it intended to take no other action. On March 8, 2019, the FERC terminated the 501-G proceeding and required no other action. MRT did not file a FERC Form No. 501-G because it had filed a general rate case in June 2018. In July 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting MRT’s proposed rate increases subject to refund upon a final determination of MRT’s rates and ordering MRT to refile its rate case to reflect the elimination of an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. On August 30, 2018, MRT submitted a supplemental filing to comply with the FERC’s order. MRT has appealed the FERC’s order to eliminate the income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. The FERC set MRT’s re-filed rate case for hearing. The procedural schedule has been suspended to afford MRT


time to file a settlement.  If a settlement is not filed or all of the participants do not agree to a settlement, then the proceeding may advance to hearing. On November 5, 2019, as supplemented on December 13, 2019, MRT filed an uncontested proposed settlement for its 2018 rate case. On October 30, 2019, MRT filed a second general rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the NGA. The 2019 rate case was necessary because at the time of filing the 2019 rate case, the proposed settlement of the 2018 rate case was still being contested, requiring that new maximum rates be established for the non-settling parties reflecting the turnback of capacity. On November 5, 2019, MRT filed an uncontested proposed settlement for the 2019 rate case. Subsequently, MRT reached agreement with 100% of the parties participating in the MRT rate cases, and these rate case settlements are pending at the FERC. The FERC may accept or reject the proposed settlements in the 2018 and 2019 rate cases as to all of the parties, or may reject one or both of the settlements and set one or both of the rate cases for hearing.

Other Matters

Credit Facilities

The Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, please see

Note 14

to the consolidated financial statements.

Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, the Registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately

$5.1 billion

as of December 31, 2019. As of

February 19, 2020

, the Registrants had the following revolving credit facilities and utilization of such facilities:

(1)

The credit facility was issued by VUHI and is guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO.

(2)

The credit facility was issued by VCC and is guaranteed by Vectren.

Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the five revolving credit facilities.

Long-term Debt

For detailed information about the Registrants’ debt issuances in


, see

Note 14

to the consolidated financial statements.

Securities Registered with the SEC

On January 31, 2017, the Registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC, as amended on September 24, 2018, registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric’s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp.’s senior debt securities


and CenterPoint Energy’s senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts  and equity units. The joint shelf registration statement expired on January 31, 2020. For information related to the Registrants’ debt and equity security issuances in


, see Notes


and


to the consolidated financial statements.

Temporary Investments

As of

February 19, 2020

, the Registrants had no temporary investments.

Money Pool

The Registrants participate in a money pool through which they and certain of their subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the CenterPoint Energy money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CenterPoint Energy’s commercial paper. The net funding requirements of the CERC money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CERC’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CERC’s commercial paper. The money pool may not provide sufficient funds to meet the Registrants’ cash needs.

The table below summarizes CenterPoint Energy money pool activity by Registrant as of

February 19, 2020

:

Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings

The interest on borrowings under the Registrants’ credit facilities is based on their credit ratings. The interest on borrowings under the credit facilities is based on each respective borrower’s credit ratings. On October 25, 2019, Moody’s downgraded VUHI’s and Indiana Gas’ senior unsecured debt rating to A3 from A2 and SIGECO’s senior secured debt rating to A1 from Aa3. The outlooks of VUHI, Indiana Gas and SIGECO were revised to stable from negative. On November 18, 2019, Moody’s withdrew the ratings of Indiana Gas. On November 21, 2019, Moody’s placed the A3 senior unsecured rating, A3 Issuers rating, and A1 senior secured rating of Houston Electric on review for downgrade. On February 19, 2020, Fitch downgraded Houston Electric’s senior secured debt to A from A+ with a negative outlook and affirmed CenterPoint Energy’s BBB rating with a negative outlook. As of

February 19, 2020

, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of the Registrants:

(1)

A Moody’s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer’s rating over the medium term.

(2)

An S&P outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.

(3)

A Fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period.

The Registrants cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings


are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Registrants’ securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the Registrants’ commercial strategies.

A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities. If the Registrants’ credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by S&P and Moody’s from the ratings that existed as of

December 31, 2019

, the impact on the borrowing costs under the five revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the Registrants’ ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market.  Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments.

CES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC operating in the Energy Services reportable segment, provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities throughout the United States. To economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES.  Similarly, mark-to-market exposure offsetting and exceeding the credit threshold may cause the counterparty to provide collateral to CES.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the amount posted by CES as collateral aggregated approximately

$92 million

. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. CenterPoint Energy and CERC estimate that as of

December 31, 2019

, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregated

$467 million

, and

none

of such amount was utilized.

Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper’s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months’ charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as

$181 million

as of

December 31, 2019

. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.

ZENS and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy)

If CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS holders thought its liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, some ZENS holders might decide to exchange their ZENS for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and shares of ZENS-Related Securities would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of ZENS-Related Securities are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the ZENS. If all ZENS had been exchanged for cash on

December 31, 2019

, deferred taxes of approximately

$429 million

would have been payable in


. If all the ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on

December 31, 2019

, capital gains taxes of approximately

$149 million

would have been payable in


. For additional information about ZENS, see

Note 12

to the consolidated financial statements.

Cross Defaults

Under each of CenterPoint Energy’s, Houston Electric’s and CERC’s respective revolving credit facilities, as well as under CenterPoint Energy’s term loan agreement, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding

$125 million

by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries’ debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.


Under each of VUHI’s and VCC’s respective revolving credit facilities and term loan agreements, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $50 million by the borrower, any of their respective subsidiaries or any of the respective guarantors of a credit facility or term loan agreement will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement.

Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures

From time to time, the Registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. The Registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the Registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions.

CenterPoint Energy previously disclosed that it may reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy has no intention to reduce its ownership of Enable common units and currently plans to hold such Enable common units and to utilize any cash distributions received on such Enable common units to finance a portion of CenterPoint Energy’s capital expenditure program. CenterPoint Energy may consider or alter its plans or proposals in respect of any such plans in the future.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Enable Midstream Partners (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

In September 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin

, after which CERC’s equity investment in Enable met the criteria for discontinued operations classification. As a result, the operations have been classified as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented. For further information, see

Note 11

to the consolidated financial statements.

CenterPoint Energy receives quarterly cash distributions from Enable on its common units and Enable Series A Preferred Units. A reduction in the cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives from Enable could significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s liquidity.  For additional information about cash distributions from Enable, see Notes


and


to the consolidated financial statements.

Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt Issuances

From time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the U.S. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. For further information, see

Note 9

(a) to the consolidated financial statements.

Weather Hedge (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy and CERC have historically entered into partial weather hedges for certain NGD jurisdictions and electric operations’ Texas service territory to mitigate the impact of fluctuations from normal weather. CenterPoint Energy and CERC remain exposed to some weather risk as a result of the partial hedges. For more information about weather hedges, see

Note 9

(a) to the consolidated financial statements.


Collection of Receivables from REPs (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. Before conducting business, a REP must register with the PUCT and must meet certain financial qualifications. Nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows. In the event of a REP’s default, Houston Electric’s tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for Houston Electric to request that the PUCT suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, Houston Electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against Houston Electric involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, Houston Electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, PUCT regulations authorize utilities, such as Houston Electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.

Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements

In addition to the above factors, the Registrants’ liquidity and capital resources could be affected by:

•

cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments;

•

acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);

•

increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);

•

increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans;

•

various legislative or regulatory actions;

•

incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);

•

the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp., to satisfy their obligations to CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric;

•

slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices or changing economic conditions (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);

•

the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;

•

the outcome of litigation;

•

contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•

restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and

•

various other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.


Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money

Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants’ and certain of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities, see

Note 14

to the consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the Registrants’ financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in the Registrants’ historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require the Registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that the Registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants’ operating environment changes. The Registrants’ significant accounting policies are discussed in

Note 2

to the consolidated financial statements. The Registrants believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors.

Accounting for Rate Regulation

Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Electric T&D reportable segment, CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment, and CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution reportable segments apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see

Note 7

to the consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition Accounting

The Registrants evaluate acquisitions to determine when a set of acquired activities and assets represent a business. When control of a business is obtained, the Registrants apply the acquisition method of accounting and record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest obtained based on fair value at the acquisition date.

The fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting provisions and earning a regulated return generally approximate their carrying values. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, are determined using the income and market approach, which estimation methods may require the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices.  Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.  The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income beginning on the date of the acquisition.

On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash.  The Merger is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations,


with CenterPoint Energy as the accounting acquirer of Vectren. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date.

Vectren’s regulated operations, comprised of electric generation and electric and natural gas delivery services, are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the IURC and the PUCO, and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost-recovery provisions currently in place for Vectren’s regulated operations provide revenues designed to recover the cost of providing utility service and a return on and recovery of investment in rate base assets and liabilities. Thus, the fair values of Vectren’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets nor liabilities acquired reflect any adjustments related to these amounts. The fair value of regulatory assets not earning a return have been determined using the income approach and include the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs.

The fair value of Vectren’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, and the allocation of fair value to reporting units on the Merger Date was determined under the income approach using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow income approach, and for the measurement of certain assets and liabilities, the market approach was utilized.

Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses required the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which included expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the Merger Date. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of the identified intangible assets and/or the resulting amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit. CenterPoint Energy utilized a third-party valuation specialist in determining the key assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets acquired and the allocation of goodwill to each of its reporting units on the Merger Date.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Identifiable Intangibles, Goodwill, Equity Method Investments, and Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair Value

The Registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.  Unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value due to changes in observable or estimated market value, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters could result in an impairment charge. The Registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, equity method investments, or readily determinable fair value during 2019, 2018 and 2017.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized goodwill impairment losses, discussed below, during 2019, and the Registrants recorded no impairments to goodwill in 2018 and 2017.

Fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.

Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses requires the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests. CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized a third-party valuation specialist to determine the key assumptions used in the estimate of fair value for each of its reporting units on the date of its annual goodwill impairment test.

Annual goodwill impairment test

CenterPoint Energy and CERC completed their 2019 annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2019 and determined, based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches, that no goodwill impairment charge


was required for any reporting unit based on the annual test. The fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, with the exception of CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated, Infrastructure Services and ESG reporting units. Indiana Electric Integrated’s fair value exceed its carrying value by 13%, and it had total goodwill of $1,008 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. Infrastructure Services’ fair value exceeded its carrying values by 6%, and it had total goodwill of $355 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. ESG’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8%, and it had total goodwill of $127 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. These reporting units are comprised entirely of businesses acquired in the Merger in February 2019, when assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value and as a result, carrying values approximate fair value at that time. The measurement period for the initial purchase price accounting for the reporting units acquired in the Merger, including CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated, Infrastructure Services and ESG reporting units, remained open as of the date of the annual impairment test date. Upon conclusion of the measurement period in the fourth quarter of 2019, CenterPoint Energy retrospectively evaluated the impact that the measurement period adjustments had on its annual impairment test and identified no material differences to the results, except CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 7%, and it had total goodwill of $1,121 million.  The primary driver for the excess fair value in the businesses acquired in the Merger at the annual goodwill impairment test date is a decline in market discounts rates, a key valuation assumption, from February 1, 2019 to July 1, 2019.

Although no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2019 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale (the “Disposal Group”) at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.  If the Disposal Group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.  A disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the Registrant, is also reflected as discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.

December 31, 2019 goodwill impairment assessments

In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the carrying value. As a result, CenterPoint Energy and CERC evaluated long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, for recoverability and the goodwill within the reporting units were tested for impairment as of December 31, 2019.  The long-lived assets within the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were determined to be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of December 31, 2019, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.  The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $123 million within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer.

The fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit was estimated as of December 31, 2019 using a market approach utilizing the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.  As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities


of $123 million) by approximately $21 million or 2%. As a result, CenterPoint Energy did not record a goodwill impairment on its Infrastructure Services reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.

In February 2020, certain assets and liabilities representing the businesses within the Infrastructure Services reporting unit that will be transferred under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the disposal group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities included within the reporting unit.  Upon classifying the Disposal Group as held for sale in the first quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $85 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss in 2020 may be materially different from the preliminary amount.

The fair value of the Energy Services reporting unit was estimated as of December 31, 2019 using a combination of the market approach and the income approach.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.  Certain assets groups not constituting a business within the reporting unit were valued using an income approach, as there was limited indication of value from market participants as of December 31, 2019 for these assets and liabilities.  As a result, Energy Services recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) of the Energy Services reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of December 31, 2019.  Following the impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill remaining in the Energy Services reporting unit is $62 million as of December 31, 2019.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $25 million within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer.

In February 2020 certain assets and liabilities representing substantially all of the businesses within CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reporting unit met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the disposal group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities and certain assets and liabilities within the reporting unit that will be retained by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing.  Upon classifying the disposal group as held for sale in the first quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an aggregate impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $80 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.

For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in value of an investment has occurred and the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment.

Based on an analysis of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of Enable is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of $2.4 billion will be recovered. CenterPoint Energy considers the severity and duration of the impairment, management’s intent and ability to hold the investment to recovery, significant events and conditions of Enable, including its investment grade credit rating and planned expansion projects, along with other factors, to conclude that the investment is not other than temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019. A sustained low Enable common unit price or further declines in such price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording an impairment charge in future periods. If the decrease in value of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment will be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value of the investment in Enable over its estimated fair value. Management would evaluate and likely weight both the income approach and market approach to estimate the fair value of the total investment in Enable, which includes CenterPoint Energy’s holdings of Enable common units, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. The determination of fair value will consider a number of relevant factors including Enable’s


forecasted results, recent comparable transactions and the limited float of Enable’s publicly traded common units. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of CenterPoint Energy’s total investment in Enable was $10.29 per unit. On December 31, 2019, Enable’s common unit price closed at $10.03, based on its publicly traded common units which represent approximately 21% of total outstanding units, (an aggregate of approximately $61 million below carrying value). On February 24, 2020, Enable’s common unit price closed at $7.63 (approximately $622 million below carrying value).

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates.  Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services. The contracts are generally less than one year in duration and consist of fixed price, unit, and time and material customer contracts. Under unit or time and material contracts, services are billed to customers monthly or more frequently for work completed based on units completed or the costs of time and material incurred and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Infrastructure Services has the right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the performance obligation satisfied, and therefore recognizes revenue at a point in time in the amount to which it has the right to invoice, which results in accrued unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period. Under fixed price contracts, Infrastructure Services performs larger scale construction and repair services. Services performed under fixed price contracts are typically billed per the terms of the contract, which can range from completion of specific milestones to scheduled billing intervals. Billings occur monthly or more frequently for work completed and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized over time as control is transferred using the input method, considering costs incurred relative to total expected cost. Total expected cost is therefore a significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

Pension and Other Retirement Plans

CenterPoint Energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. CenterPoint Energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, CenterPoint Energy’s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. Please read “— Other Significant Matters — Pension Plans” for further discussion.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2(u) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the Registrants.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS

Pension Plans (CenterPoint Energy).

As discussed in

Note 8

(b) to the consolidated financial statements, CenterPoint Energy maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.

Under the terms of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plan, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. CenterPoint Energy’s funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA.


Additionally, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.

CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately

$76 million

to the qualified pension plans and contributions aggregating approximately

$7 million

to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans in


.

Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.

As the sponsor of a plan, CenterPoint Energy is required to (a) recognize on its Consolidated Balance Sheet  an asset for the plan’s over-funded status or  a liability for the plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.

The projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was

$2.5 billion

and

$2.0 billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans by

$448 million

. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during


could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.

Houston Electric and CERC participate in CenterPoint Energy’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. Pension cost and the impact to pre-tax earnings, after capitalization and regulatory impacts, by Registrant were as follows:

The calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

As of December 31,


, CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

5.75%

, which is

0.25

% lower than the

6.00%

rate assumed as of

December 31, 2018

. The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. CenterPoint Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.

As of December 31,


, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of

3.20%

, which is

1.15%

lower than the

4.35%

discount rate assumed as of

December 31, 2018

. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on


high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s plans.

CenterPoint Energy’s actuarially determined pension and other postemployment expense for


and


that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in certain Texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.  Pension cost for


, including the nonqualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be

$45 million

, of which CenterPoint Energy expects approximately

$52 million

to impact pre-tax earnings after effecting such deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of

5.75%

and a discount rate of

3.20%

as of

December 31, 2019

. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from

5.75%

to

5.25%

,


pension cost would increase by approximately

$10 million

.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded nonqualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by

$448 million

.  If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from

3.20%

to

2.70%

, the assumption change would increase CenterPoint Energy’s projected benefit obligation by approximately

$127 million

and decrease its


pension cost by approximately

$5 million

. The expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. In addition, the assumption change would impact CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of

December 31, 2019

by

$110 million

and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in


of

$13 million

, net of tax of

$4 million

, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact CenterPoint Energy’s future pension expense and liabilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Impact of Changes in Interest Rates, Equity Prices and Energy Commodity Prices

The Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements. Most of the revenues and income from the Registrants’ business activities are affected by market risks. Categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non-trading activities, interest rates and equity prices. A description of each market risk is set forth below:

•

Interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates.

•

Equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities (CenterPoint Energy).

•

Commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and price volatilities of commodities, such as natural gas, NGLs and other energy commodities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

Management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks.

Interest Rate Risk

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Registrants had outstanding long-term debt and lease obligations and CenterPoint Energy had obligations under its ZENS that subject them to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates.

CenterPoint Energy’s floating rate obligations aggregated

$3.9 billion

and

$210 million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  If the floating interest rates were to increase by 10% from

December 31, 2019

rates, CenterPoint Energy’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $9 million annually.

Houston Electric did not have any floating rate obligations as of either

December 31, 2019

or


.

CERC’s floating rate obligations aggregated

$376 million

and

$210 million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 10% from

December 31, 2019

rates, CERC’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $1 million annually.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, CenterPoint Energy had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) aggregating

$11.2 billion

and

$9.0 billion

, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of

$12.2 billion

and

$9.2 billion

,


respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately

$344 million

if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of

December 31, 2019

.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Houston Electric had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating

$5.0 billion

and

$4.8 billion

, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of approximately

$5.5 billion

and

$4.8 billion

, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose Houston Electric to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately

$179 million

if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of

December 31, 2019

.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, CERC had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating

$2.2 billion

and

$2.2 billion

, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of

$2.5 billion

and

$2.3 billion

, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CERC to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately

$77 million

if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels at

December 31, 2019

.

In general, such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Registrants were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.

As discussed in

Note 12

to the consolidated financial statements, the ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of

$19 million

at

December 31, 2019

was a fixed-rate obligation and, therefore, did not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately

$2 million

if interest rates were to decline by 10% from levels at

December 31, 2019

. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component, a

$893 million

recorded liability at

December 31, 2019

, are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income and, therefore, it is exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10% from

December 31, 2019

levels, the fair value of the derivative component liability would decrease by approximately

$1 million

, which would be recorded as an unrealized gain in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Equity Market Value Risk (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy is exposed to equity market value risk through its ownership of

10.2 million

shares of AT&T Common and

0.9 million

shares of Charter Common, which CenterPoint Energy holds to facilitate its ability to meet its obligations under the ZENS. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS. A decrease of 10% from the

December 31, 2019

aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of less than

$1 million

, which would be recorded as a loss on debt securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Commodity Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy and CERC use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in their businesses. The commodity risk created by these instruments, including the offsetting impact on the market value of natural gas inventory, is described below. CenterPoint Energy and CERC measure this commodity risk using a sensitivity analysis. For purposes of this analysis, CenterPoint Energy and CERC estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price to their net open fixed price position (including forward fixed price physical contracts, natural gas inventory and fixed price financial contracts) at the end of each period. As of

December 31, 2019

, the recorded fair value of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s non-trading energy derivatives was a net asset of

$73 million

(before collateral), all of which is related to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment. A $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price would have had a combined impact of

$13 million

on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s non-trading energy derivatives net asset and the market value of natural gas inventory.

Commodity price risk is not limited to changes in forward NYMEX prices. Variation of commodity pricing between the different indices used to mark to market portions of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas inventory (Gas Daily) and the related fair value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s net income. Over time, any gains or losses on the sale of storage gas inventory would be offset by gains or losses on the fair value hedges.


CenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations in Indiana have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas, coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations, which, subject to compliance with those regulations, allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms. CenterPoint Energy’s utility natural gas operations in Indiana have regulatory authority to lock in pricing for up to 50% of annual natural gas purchases using arrangements with an original term of up to 10 years. This authority has been utilized to secure fixed price natural gas using both physical purchases and financial derivatives. As of

December 31, 2019

, the recorded fair value of non-trading energy derivative liabilities was

$22 million

for CenterPoint Energy’s utility natural gas operations in Indiana, which is offset by a regulatory asset.

Although CenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk, natural gas and coal prices have other effects on working capital requirements, interest costs, and some level of price-sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered. Constructive regulatory orders, such as those authorizing lost margin recovery, other innovative rate designs and recovery of unaccounted for natural gas and other natural gas-related expenses, also mitigate the effect natural gas costs may have on CenterPoint Energy’s financial condition. In 2008, the PUCO approved an exit of the merchant function in CenterPoint Energy’s Ohio natural gas service territory, allowing Ohio customers to purchase substantially all natural gas directly from retail marketers rather than from CenterPoint Energy.


Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Acquisitions - Vectren Corporation - Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company completed the acquisition of Vectren Corporation (“Vectren”) for $6 billion in cash on February 1, 2019. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including intangible assets and goodwill of $4.6 billion. Of the intangible assets acquired, $297 million was allocated to identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade name with the remainder of $4.3 billion being recorded as goodwill. Management estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. In addition, the determination of the business fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and future cash flows. Determining the discount rates for the nonregulated businesses acquired required management to estimate the appropriate entity specific risk premiums for those nonregulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks which included expectations about future market or economic conditions.


Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the amount of the identified intangible assets, the resulting amount of goodwill, or both.

Given the fair value determination of intangible assets acquired required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the company specific risk premium affecting the discount rate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows and company specific risk premium affecting the discount rate for the intangible assets of the nonregulated businesses acquired included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over acquisition valuation, including management’s controls over the forecasts of future cash flows and selection of the company specific risk premium assumption used in the determinations of the discount rates.

•

We considered the impact of changes to the discount rate and long-term growth rate on the fair value.

•

We evaluated the value at which acquired assets were recorded under the applicable accounting guidance based on the regulated nature of the entity.

•

We assessed the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:

◦

Historical revenues and operating margins.

◦

Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.

◦

Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.

•

We evaluated whether the estimated future cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

•

We involved our fair value specialists who assisted in:

◦

Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used to determine the customer relationship intangible assets and the company specific risk premiums.

◦

Testing the determined discount rates by independently estimating a discount rate for each business using a process consistent with generally accepted valuation practices.

Goodwill - Refer to Note 6 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In its annual goodwill impairment test on July 1, 2019 (“measurement date”) and as triggering events are identified, the Company used the discounted cash flow model and a market approach to estimate fair value of each reporting unit, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and operating margins based on certain assumptions including (i) future capital expenditures and rate base growth, (ii) estimated future rate changes, (iii) discount rates, and (iv) long-term growth rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of a reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company’s goodwill is $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, of which $4.3 billion resulted from the acquisition of Vectren. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.

Given the significant assumptions used by management to estimate fair value including (i) future capital expenditures and rate base growth, (ii) estimated future rate changes, (iii) discount rates, and (iv) long-term growth rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin, specifically for reporting units containing unregulated business units and Vectren rate regulated jurisdictions, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve fair value specialists.


How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the assumptions used to forecast future revenue and operating margin used by management within the discounted cash flow model included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future capital expenditures, future rate base growth, estimated future rate changes, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:

◦

Historical revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, rate base growth, and rate changes.

◦

Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.

◦

Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.

•

We compared future rate changes to the Company’s scheduled rate filings and the amount of capital expenditures for the regulated entities to communications with regulators including integrated resource plans.

•

We compared actual revenue growth and capital expenditures results for 2019 to the planned results as of the acquisition date.

•

We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the measurement date to December 31, 2019.

•

We involved our fair value specialists who assisted in:

◦

Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used to determine the company specific risk premiums in calculating the discount rate.

◦

Testing the determined discount rates by independently estimating a discount rate for each business using a process consistent with generally accepted valuation practices.

◦

Evaluating the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate through a comparison to industry reports and peer companies.

Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company, through its regulated electric and gas subsidiaries is subject to rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas by the Railroad Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, “the Commissions”), and those municipalities (in Texas only) served by the Company. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment, net; regulatory assets and liabilities; utility revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization expense; and income tax expense.

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes by certain municipalities and the Commissions. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.


We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory actions on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of capital investments made by the Company and (3) refunds to customers. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due its inherent complexities.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refund or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•

We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•

For matters with a high degree of subjectivity, we read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in the states the Company operates in, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.

•

For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commission and the filings with the Commission by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.

•

We evaluated management’s plans regarding property, plant, and equipment for indications of potential impairment. We inspected the capital-projects budget and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management’s assertion regarding probability of a disallowance of long-lived assets.

•

We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects and inquired of management to assess whether capitalized costs are probable of disallowance.

•

We obtained an analysis from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy, indirectly through CNP Midstream, owned approximately

53.7

%

of the common units representing limited partner interests in Enable,


%

of the management rights and


%

of the incentive distribution rights in Enable GP and also directly owned an aggregate of

14,520,000

Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b)

Principles of Consolidation

The accounts of the Registrants and their wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation, except as described below.

Businesses within the Infrastructure Services reportable segment provide underground pipeline construction and repair services for customers that include NGD utilities. In accordance with consolidation guidance in ASC 980—Regulated Operations, costs incurred by NGD utilities for these pipeline construction and repair services are not eliminated in consolidation when capitalized and included in rate base by the NGD utility. Fees incurred by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD for pipeline construction and repair services that were capitalized totaled

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, for the 11 months ended December 31, 2019.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had VIEs consisting of the Bond Companies, which are consolidated. The consolidated VIEs are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose entities that were formed solely for the purpose of securitizing transition and system restoration related property. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have no recourse to any assets or revenues of the Bond Companies. The bonds issued by these VIEs are payable only from and secured by transition and system restoration property and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric.

(c)

Equity and Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair Value (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which it has an ownership interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant influence. CenterPoint Energy also uses the equity method for investments in which it has ownership percentages greater than 50%, when it exercises significant influence, does not have control and is not considered the primary beneficiary, if applicable.

Under the equity method, CenterPoint Energy adjusts its investments each period for contributions made, distributions received, respective shares of comprehensive income and amortization of basis differences, as appropriate. CenterPoint Energy evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate there is a loss in value of the investment that is other than a temporary decline.


CenterPoint Energy considers distributions received from equity method investments which do not exceed cumulative equity in earnings subsequent to the date of investment to be a return on investment and classifies these distributions as operating activities in its Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. CenterPoint Energy considers distributions received from equity method investments in excess of cumulative equity in earnings subsequent to the date of investment to be a return of investment and classifies these distributions as investing activities in its Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Investments without a readily determinable fair value will be measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable prices changes of an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

(d)

Revenues

The Registrants record revenue for electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services under the accrual method and these revenues are recognized upon delivery to customers. Electricity deliveries not billed by month-end are accrued based on actual AMS data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Natural gas sales not billed by month-end are accrued based upon estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and currently effective tariff rates. Revenue for some pipeline construction services are based on the percentage of completion method. For further discussion, see

Note 5

.

(e)

MISO Transactions

Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position, meaning net purchases within that interval are recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income in Utility natural gas, fuel and purchased power, and net sales within that interval are recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income in Utility revenues. On occasion, prior period transactions are resettled outside the routine process due to a change in the MISO’s tariff or a material interpretation thereof. Expenses associated with resettlements are recorded once the resettlement is probable and the resettlement amount can be estimated. Revenues associated with resettlements are recognized when the amount is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

(f)

Guarantees

CenterPoint Energy recognizes guarantee obligations at fair value. CenterPoint Energy discloses parent company guarantees of a subsidiary’s obligation when that guarantee results in the exposure of a material obligation of the parent company even if the probability of fulfilling such obligation is considered remote. See Note 16(c) and (d).

(g)

Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangibles

The Registrants record property, plant and equipment at historical cost and expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred.

The Registrants periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  For rate regulated businesses, recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by determining if a capital disallowance from a regulator is probable through monitoring the outcome of rate cases and other proceedings.  For non-rate regulated businesses, recoverability is assessed based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets compared to the carrying value of the assets.  As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, determined that the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets associated with the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of that date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets.  No long-lived asset or intangible asset impairments were recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Subsequent to the Registrant’s adoption of ASU 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment on January 1, 2018, CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognize a goodwill impairment by the amount a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill within that reporting unit. CenterPoint Energy includes deferred tax assets and liabilities within its reporting unit’s carrying value for the purposes of annual and interim impairment tests, regardless of whether the estimated fair value reflects the disposition of such assets and liabilities. For further information about the goodwill impairment tests during 2019, see Note 6.


(h)

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell and a sale is expected to be completed within one year.  The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.  If the disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.  A disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the Registrant, is also reflected as discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.

(i)

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Registrants apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations to the Houston Electric T&D reportable segment, Indiana Electric Integrated segment and the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment. The Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may collect revenues subject to refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues, estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings.

The Registrants’ rate-regulated businesses recognize removal costs as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with regulatory treatment. In addition, a portion of the amount of removal costs collected from customers that relate to AROs has been reflected as an asset retirement liability in accordance with accounting guidance for AROs.

For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see

Note 7

.

(j)

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

The Registrants compute depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on economic lives or regulatory-mandated recovery periods. Amortization expense includes amortization of certain regulatory assets and other intangibles.

(k)

Capitalization of Interest and AFUDC

The Registrants capitalize interest and AFUDC as a component of projects under construction and amortize it over the assets’ estimated useful lives once the assets are placed in service. AFUDC represents the composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction for subsidiaries that apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations. Although AFUDC increases both utility plant and earnings, it is realized in cash when the assets are included in rates.

(1)

Included in Interest and other finance charges on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.

(2)

Included in Other Income (Expense) on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.

(l)

Income Taxes

Houston Electric and CERC are included in CenterPoint Energy’s U.S. federal consolidated income tax return. Houston Electric and CERC report their income tax provision on a separate entity basis pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with CenterPoint Energy. Current federal and certain state income taxes are payable to or receivable from CenterPoint Energy.

The Registrants use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax


assets for which management believes realization is not considered to be more likely than not. The Registrants recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense (benefit), as applicable, in their respective Statements of Consolidated Income. CenterPoint Energy reports the income tax provision associated with its interest in Enable in income tax expense (benefit) in its Statements of Consolidated Income.

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law comprehensive tax reform legislation informally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, or TCJA, which resulted in significant changes to federal tax laws effective January 1, 2018. See

Note 15

for further discussion of the impacts of tax reform implementation.

To the extent certain EDIT of the Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may be recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded, respectively.

The Registrants use the portfolio approach to recognize income tax effects on other comprehensive income from accumulated other comprehensive income.

Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the approximate lives of the related property.

(m)

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management reviews the outstanding accounts receivable, as well as the bad debt write-offs experienced in the past, and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.

The table below summarizes the Registrants’ provision for doubtful accounts for


,


and


:

(n)

Inventory

The Registrants’ inventory consists principally of materials and supplies, and for CERC, natural gas, and for CenterPoint Energy, coal inventory. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Materials and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to plant when installed. Natural gas inventories of CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment at locations qualifying for and utilizing the fair value hedge accounting election are valued at fair value; inventories at locations not qualifying for or not utilizing the fair value hedge accounting election are valued at the lower of average cost or market. During


,


and


, CERC recorded write-downs of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market which are disclosed on the respective Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

(o)

Derivative Instruments

The Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. The Registrants utilize derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on operating results and cash flows. Such derivatives are recognized in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value unless the Registrant elects the normal purchase and sales exemption for qualified physical transactions. A derivative may be designated as a normal purchase or normal sale if the intent is to physically receive or deliver the product for use or sale in the normal course of business. CenterPoint Energy and CERC have elected to record changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness immediately in their Statements of Consolidated Income.

CenterPoint Energy has a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate and reportable segment officers that oversees commodity price, weather and credit risk activities, including the Registrants’ marketing, risk management services and hedging activities. The committee’s duties are to establish the Registrants’ commodity risk policies, allocate board-approved commercial risk limits, approve the use of new products and commodities, monitor positions and ensure compliance with the Registrants’ risk


management policies and procedures and limits established by CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors. The Registrants’ policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments. A leveraged financial instrument, for this purpose, is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument.

(p)

Investments in Equity Securities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy and CERC report equity securities at estimated fair value in their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded as Other Income (Expense) in their respective Statements of Consolidated Income.

(q)

Environmental Costs

The Registrants expense or capitalize environmental expenditures, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. The Registrants expense amounts that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not have future economic benefit. The Registrants record undiscounted liabilities related to these future costs when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

(r)

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Registrants consider cash equivalents to be short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Bond Companies (VIEs) solely to support servicing the Securitization Bonds as of

December 31, 2019

and


are reflected on CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In connection with the issuance of Securitization Bonds, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric were required to establish restricted cash accounts to collateralize the bonds that were issued in these financing transactions. These restricted cash accounts are not available for withdrawal until the maturity of the bonds and are not included in cash and cash equivalents. For more information on restricted cash see

Note 20

.

(s)

Preferred Stock and Dividends

Preferred stock is evaluated to determine balance sheet classification, and all conversion and redemption features are evaluated for bifurcation treatment. Proceeds received net of issuance costs are recognized on the settlement date. Cash dividends become a liability once declared. Income available to common stockholders is computed by deducting from net income the dividends accumulated and earned during the period on cumulative preferred stock.

(t)

Purchase Accounting

The Registrants evaluate acquisitions to determine when a set of acquired activities and assets represent a business. When control of a business is obtained, the Registrants apply the acquisition method of accounting and record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest obtained based on fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income beginning on the date of the acquisition.

(u)

New Accounting Pronouncements

The following table provides an overview of certain recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements applicable to all the Registrants, unless otherwise noted.


Management believes that other recently adopted standards and recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.

Property, Plant and Equipment

(a) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the following:


(1)

SIGECO and AGC own a 300 MW unit at the Warrick Power Plant (Warrick Unit 4) as tenants in common. SIGECO’s share of the cost of this unit as of December 31, 2019, is

$


million

with accumulated depreciation totaling

$


million

. AGC and SIGECO share equally in the cost of operation and output of the unit. SIGECO’s share of operating costs is included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

(2)

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

(3)

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

(b) Depreciation and Amortization

The following table presents depreciation and amortization expense for


,


and


:

(c) AROs

The Registrants recorded AROs associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in its buildings, including substation building structures. CenterPoint Energy recorded AROs relating to the closure of the ash ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric also recorded AROs relating to treated wood poles for electric distribution, distribution transformers containing PCB (also known as Polychlorinated Biphenyl), and underground fuel storage tanks. CenterPoint Energy and CERC also recorded AROs relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place. The estimates of future liabilities were developed using historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors.


A reconciliation of the changes in the ARO liability recorded in Other non-current liabilities on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:

(1)

Reflected in Regulatory assets on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

In 2019, the Registrants reflected an increase in their respective ARO liability, which is primarily attributable to decreases in the long-term interest rates used for discounting in the ARO calculation and increased estimated closure costs for CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation. In 2018, CenterPoint Energy and CERC reflected a decrease in their respective ARO liability, which is primarily attributable to increases in the long-term interest rates used for discounting in the ARO calculation.

(4)

Mergers and Acquisitions (CenterPoint Energy)

Merger with Vectren.

On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the previously announced Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately

$


billion

in cash. Each share of Vectren common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing was canceled and converted into the right to receive

$

72.00

in cash per share, without interest. At the closing, each stock unit payable in Vectren common stock or whose value is determined with reference to the value of Vectren common stock, whether vested or unvested, was canceled with cash consideration paid in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. These amounts did not include a stub period cash dividend of

$

0.41145

per share, which was declared, with CenterPoint Energy’s consent, by Vectren’s board of directors on January 16, 2019, and paid to Vectren stockholders as of the record date of February 1, 2019.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and immediately subsequent to the close of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy cash settled

$


million

in outstanding share-based awards issued prior to the Merger Date by Vectren to its employees. As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy assumed a liability for these share-based awards of

$


million

and recorded an incremental cost of

$


million

in Operation and maintenance expenses on its Statements of Consolidated Income during the year ended

December 31, 2019

for the accelerated vesting of the awards in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

Subsequent to the close of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy recognized severance totaling

$


million

to employees terminated immediately subsequent to the Merger close, inclusive of change of control severance payments to executives of Vectren under existing agreements, and which is included in Operation and maintenance expenses on its Statements of Consolidated Income during the year ended

December 31, 2019

. Total severance cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 was

$


million

.

In connection with the Merger, VUHI and VCC made offers to prepay certain outstanding guaranteed senior notes as required pursuant to certain note purchase agreements previously entered into by VUHI and VCC. See

Note 14

for further details.

Following the closing, shares of Vectren common stock, which previously traded under the ticker symbol “VVC” on the NYSE, ceased trading on and were delisted from the NYSE.

The Merger is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, with CenterPoint Energy as the accounting acquirer of Vectren. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date.

Vectren’s regulated operations, comprised of electric generation and electric and natural gas energy delivery services, are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the IURC and the PUCO, and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost-recovery provisions currently in place for Vectren’s regulated operations provide revenues derived from costs including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Thus, the fair value of Vectren’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting


provisions approximate their carrying values on the Merger Date.  The fair value of regulatory assets not earning a return have been determined using the income approach and are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs.

The fair value of Vectren’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, have been determined using the income approach and the market approach. The valuation of Vectren’s long-term debt is primarily considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. All other valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices.

The following table presents the purchase price allocation as of

December 31, 2019

(in millions):

CenterPoint Energy completed a final valuation analysis necessary to determine the fair market values of all of Vectren’s assets and liabilities and the allocation of its purchase price. Changes from the preliminary purchase price allocation originally reported in the first quarter of 2019 primarily included additional information obtained related to intangible assets and the allocation of the fair value between reporting units.

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill, which is primarily attributable to significant potential strategic benefits to CenterPoint Energy, including growth opportunities for more rate-regulated investment, more customers for existing products and services and additional products and services for existing customers. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy believes the Merger will increase geographic and business diversity as well as scale in attractive jurisdictions and economies. The value assigned to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.

The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and related useful lives as included in the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2019 include:

Amortization expense related to the operation and maintenance agreements and construction backlog was

$


million

in


, and is included in Non-utility cost of revenues, including natural gas on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.


Amortization expense related to customer relationships and trade names was

$


million

in


and is included in Depreciation and amortization expense on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

The results of operations for Vectren included in CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the Merger Date for the year ended

December 31, 2019

are as follows:

, which were included in Operation and maintenance expenses in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Acquisition of Utility Pipeline Construction Company.

An acquisition was made during the year ended

December 31, 2019

by CenterPoint Energy’s Infrastructure Services reportable segment, resulting in goodwill and intangible assets of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The intangible assets primarily relate to backlog and customer relationships. The allocation of the

$


million

purchase price has been finalized. The results of operations for the acquired company have been included in CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are not significant to the consolidated financial results of CenterPoint Energy. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisition because the effects of the acquisition were not significant to CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial results for all periods presented.

(5)

Revenue Recognition

The Registrants adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for those contracts that were not completed as of the date of adoption. Application of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Registrants expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services.


The following tables disaggregate revenues by reportable segment and major source:

CenterPoint Energy

(1)

Reflected in Utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

(2)

Reflected in Non-utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

(3)

Primarily consists of income from ARPs and leases. ARPs are contracts between the utility and its regulators, not between the utility and a customer. The Registrants recognize ARP revenue as other revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. Upon recovery of ARP revenue through incorporation in rates charged for utility service to customers, ARP revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers. The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.

(4)

Reflects revenues from Vectren subsidiaries for the period from February 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

Houston Electric


(1)

Primarily consists of income from ARPs and leases. ARPs are contracts between the utility and its regulators, not between the utility and a customer. The Registrants recognize ARP revenue as other revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. Upon recovery of ARP revenue through incorporation in rates charged for utility service to customers, ARP revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers. The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.

CERC

Primarily consists of income from ARPs and leases. ARPs are contracts between the utility and its regulators, not between the utility and a customer. The Registrants recognize ARP revenue as other revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. Upon recovery of ARP revenue through incorporation in rates charged for utility service to customers, ARP revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers. The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.

Revenues from Contracts with Customers

Houston Electric T&D (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric).

Houston Electric distributes electricity to customers over time and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by the PUCT, is recognized as electricity is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services


requested by customers are provided at a point in time with control transferring upon the completion of the service. Revenue for discretionary services is recognized upon completion of service based on the tariff rates set by the PUCT. Payments for electricity distribution and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis. Houston Electric performs transmission services over time as a stand-ready obligation to provide a reliable network of transmission systems. Revenue is recognized upon time elapsed, and the monthly tariff rate set by the PUCT. Payments are received on a monthly basis.

Indiana Electric Integrated (CenterPoint Energy).

Indiana Electric generates, distributes and transmits electricity to customers over time, and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by state regulators, is recognized as electricity is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Customers are billed monthly and payment terms, set by the regulator, require payment within a month of billing.

Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

CERC distributes and transports natural gas to customers over time, and customers consume the natural gas when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by the state governing agency for that service area, is recognized as natural gas is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services requested by the customer are satisfied at a point in time and revenue is recognized upon completion of service and the tariff rates set by the applicable state regulator. Payments of natural gas distribution, transportation and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis.

Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

The majority of CES natural gas sales contracts are considered a derivative, as the contracts typically have a stated minimum or contractual volume of delivery.

For contracts in which CES delivers the full requirement of the natural gas needed by the customer and a volume is not stated, a contract as defined under ASC 606 is created upon the customer’s exercise of its option to take natural gas. CES supplies natural gas to retail customers over time as customers consume the natural gas when delivered. For wholesale customers, CES supplies natural gas at a point in time because the wholesale customer is presumed to have storage capabilities. Control is transferred to both types of customers upon delivery of natural gas. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis based on the estimated volume of natural gas delivered and the price agreed upon with the customer. Payments are received on a monthly basis.

AMAs are natural gas sales contracts under which CES also assumes management of a customer’s physical storage and/or transportation capacity. AMAs have two distinct performance obligations, which consist of natural gas sales and natural gas delivery because delivery could occur separate from the sale of natural gas (e.g., from storage to customer premises). Most AMAs’ natural gas sales performance obligations are accounted for as embedded derivatives. The transaction price is allocated between the sale of natural gas and the delivery based on the stand-alone selling price as stated in the contract. CES performs natural gas delivery over time as customers take delivery of the natural gas and recognizes revenue on an aggregated monthly basis based on the volume of natural gas delivered and the fees stated within the contract. Payments are received on a monthly basis.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy).

Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services. The contracts are generally less than one year in duration and consist of fixed price, unit, and time and material customer contracts. Under unit or time and material contracts, Infrastructure Services performs construction and repair services under specific work-orders at prices established by master service agreements. The performance obligation is defined at the work-order level. These services are billed to customers monthly or more frequently for work completed based on units completed or the costs of time and material incurred and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Infrastructure Services has the right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the performance obligation satisfied, and therefore recognizes revenue at a point in time in the amount to which it has the right to invoice, which results in accrued unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period.

Under fixed price contracts, Infrastructure Services performs larger scale construction and repair services. Each contract is typically accounted for as a single performance obligation. Services performed under fixed price contracts are typically billed per the terms of the contract, which can range from completion of specific milestones to scheduled billing intervals. Billings occur monthly or more frequently for work completed and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized over time as control is transferred using the input method, considering costs incurred relative to total expected cost. Total expected cost is therefore a significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Infrastructure Services’ revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds or warranty obligations.


On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

Contract Balances.

When the timing of delivery of service is different from the timing of the payments made by customers and when the right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time, the Registrants recognize either a contract asset (performance precedes billing) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Those customers that prepay are represented by contract liabilities until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Registrants’ contract assets are included in Accrued unbilled revenues in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an aggregate basis as of

December 31, 2019

, the Registrants’ contract assets primarily relate to contracts in the Infrastructure Services segment where revenue is recognized using the input method. The Registrants’ contract liabilities are included in Accounts payable and Other current liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an aggregate basis as of December 31, 2019, the Registrants’ contract liabilities primarily relate to ESG contracts where revenue is recognized using the input method.

The opening and closing balances of accounts receivable, other accrued unbilled revenue, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as follows:

CenterPoint Energy

(1)

Opening balances related to Vectren are as of February 1, 2019, and are thus excluded from the opening balance as of December 31, 2018.

The amount of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability was

$


million

. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between CenterPoint Energy’s performance and the customer’s payment, plus the addition of obligations acquired in the Merger.

Houston Electric

The amount of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability was

$


million

. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between Houston Electric’s performance and the customer’s payment.

CERC

CERC does not have any opening or closing contract asset or contract liability balances.


Remaining Performance Obligations (CenterPoint Energy).

The table below discloses (1) the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period for contracts and (2) when CenterPoint Energy expects to recognize this revenue. Such contracts include fixed price contracts and energy performance and sustainable infrastructure services contracts of ESG, which are included in Corporate and Other.

Practical Expedients and Exemption.

Sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers are excluded from the transaction price.

For contracts for which revenue from the satisfaction of the performance obligations is recognized in the amount invoiced, the practical expedient was elected and revenue expected to be recognized on these contracts has not been disclosed.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy’s goodwill by reportable segment as of December 31, 2018 and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill  as of

December 31, 2019

are as follows:

(1)

This represents the allocation of goodwill to reportable segments from the Merger, changes from preliminary amounts previously reported and includes the final determination of fair value for each reportable segment. See

Note 4

.

(2)

Amount presented is net of the accumulated goodwill impairment charge of

$


million

recorded in 2012. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC identified a triggering event to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment on their Energy Services reporting unit which is included in Goodwill impairment on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

CERC’s goodwill by reportable segment as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

is as follows:

(1)

Amount presented is net of the accumulated goodwill impairment charge of

$


million

recorded in 2012.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation for goodwill is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The reporting units approximate the reportable segments, with the exception of ESG, which is a separate reporting unit but included


in CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other reportable segment. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is primarily determined based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess amount is the impairment charge that should be recorded, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 2(g) for further discussion.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed the annual goodwill impairment test on July 1 of each of


and


and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit in its annual test.

In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the carrying value.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.  The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately

$


million

within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer. For further information, see Note 23.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reporting unit. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. For further information, see Note 23.

The fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit was estimated using a market approach deriving an estimated fair value as of December 31, 2019 based on the economic terms agreed upon within the Securities Purchase Agreement, a Level 2 fair value measurement.  As of December 31, 2019 the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of

$


million

) and no impairment loss was recognized.

The fair value of the Energy Services reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the market approach and the income approach as of December 31, 2019, a Level 3 fair value measurement.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.  Certain assets groups not constituting a business within the reporting unit were valued using an income approach.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized an impairment loss on their Energy Services reporting unit of

$


million

, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of

$


million

) exceeded the fair value as of December 31, 2019.

Regulatory Matters

The following is a list of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

and


.  The “amortization through” columns indicate the latest year when a regulatory asset or regulatory liability category will be fully amortized:

(a)

Pension and postretirement-related regulatory assets balances are measured annually, and the ending amortization period may change based on the actuarial valuation.

(b)

The recovery and amortization of these amounts are to be determined upon receipt of the final order.

(c)

The recovery and amortization of a portion of these amounts are expected to be determined in the next rate case.


(d)

Other regulatory assets not-earning a return includes items with different amortization periods; therefore, the amortization is accounted for through various periods.

(1)

Current regulatory assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

The unrecognized equity return will be recognized as it is recovered in rates through 2024. The timing of CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s recognition of the equity return will vary each period based on amounts actually collected during the period. The actual amounts recognized are adjusted at least annually to correct any over-collections or under-collections during the preceding 12 months.

(3)

Substantially all of these regulatory assets are not earning a return.

(4)

The EDIT and deferred revenues will be recovered or refunded to customers as required by tax and regulatory authorities. See

Note 15

for additional information.

(5)

Regulatory assets acquired in the Merger and not earning a return were recorded at fair value as of the Merger Date. Such fair value adjustments are recognized over time until the regulatory asset is recovered.


(6)

Current regulatory liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Houston Electric Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)

On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately

$


million

, exclusive of the EDIT refund discussed below.

The key proposals of the base rate case included:

•

a rate base of

$

6.4

billion

with a


%

debt/


%

equity capital structure and a

10.4

%

ROE;

•

a prudency determination on all capital investments made by Houston Electric since January 1, 2010;

•

the establishment of a rider to refund unprotected EDIT resulting from the TCJA; and

•

updated depreciation rates and approval to recover other costs.

On September 16, 2019, the ALJs issued a PFD. The PUCT began deliberating on the PFD (which is prepared by ALJs at a different state agency) during its November 14, 2019 open meeting, but delayed final determination for further consideration. The PUCT again discussed the Houston Electric rate case at its December 13, 2019 open meeting and concluded that the PUCT would consider settlement a reasonable approach to resolving the rate case and noted that Houston Electric had indicated settlement negotiations were already underway. Houston Electric updated the PUCT at its January 16, 2020 open meeting regarding the status of settlement discussions, indicating that the parties were working on a settlement and anticipated a final settlement in the near future. On January 23, 2020, Houston Electric filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the PUCT, which provides for the following, among other things:

•

an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately

$


million

;

•

an ROE of

9.4

%

;

•

a capital structure of

57.5

%

debt/

42.5

%

equity;

•

a refund of unprotected EDIT of

$


million

plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and

•

recovery of all retail transmission related costs through the TCRF.

Also, Houston Electric is not required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its TCOS and DCRF mechanisms. Future TCOS filings will take into account both ADFIT and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding. No rate base items are expected to be written off; however, approximately

$


million

in rate case expenses were written off in 2019. A base rate case application must be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order in the proceeding. Additionally, Houston Electric will not file a DCRF in 2020, nor will a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets.

Furthermore, under the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed to adopt certain ring-fencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy, which include the following:

•

Houston Electric’s credit agreements and indentures shall not contain cross-default provisions by which a default by CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates would cause a default at Houston Electric;

•

The financial covenant in Houston Electric’s credit agreement shall not be related to any entity other than Houston Electric.  Houston Electric shall not include in its debt or credit agreements any financial covenants or rating agency triggers related to any entity other than Houston Electric;

•

Houston Electric shall not pledge its assets in respect of or guarantee any debt or obligation of any of its affiliates. Houston Electric shall not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, or grant a lien upon the property of Houston Electric except pursuant to an exception in effect in Houston Electric’s current credit agreement, such as Houston Electric’s first mortgage and general mortgage;


•

Houston Electric shall maintain its own stand-alone credit facility, and Houston Electric shall not share its credit facility with any regulated or unregulated affiliate;

•

Houston Electric shall maintain ratings with all three major credit ratings agencies;

•

Houston Electric shall maintain a stand-alone credit rating;

•

Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds shall be secured only with assets of Houston Electric;

•

No Houston Electric assets may be used to secure the debt of CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates;

•

Houston Electric shall not hold out its credit as being available to pay the debt of any affiliates (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Houston Electric is not considered to be holding its credit out to pay the debt of affiliates, or in breach of any other ring-fencing measure, with respect to the

$


million

of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds that currently serve as collateral for certain outstanding CenterPoint Energy pollution control bonds);

•

Without prior approval of the PUCT, neither CenterPoint Energy nor any affiliate of CenterPoint Energy (excluding Houston Electric) may incur, guarantee, or pledge assets in respect of any incremental new debt that is dependent on: (1) the revenues of Houston Electric in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of CenterPoint Energy; or (2) the equity of Houston Electric;

•

Houston Electric shall not transfer any material assets or facilities to any affiliates, other than a transfer that is on an arm’s length basis consistent with the PUCT’s affiliate standards applicable to Houston Electric;

•

Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not commingle its assets with those of other CenterPoint Energy affiliates;

•

Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not lend money to or borrow money from CenterPoint Energy; and

•

Houston Electric shall notify the PUCT if its issuer credit rating or corporate credit rating as rated by any of the three major rating agencies falls below investment grade.

The PUCT approved the settlement at its February 14, 2020 open meeting.  A final order from the PUCT is currently expected during the first quarter of 2020; however, motions for rehearing, if granted, could result in the order being issued after the first quarter of 2020. The rates are expected to be implemented 45 days after the final order is issued.

CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric record pre-tax expense for (i) probable disallowances of  capital investments and (ii) customer refund obligations and costs deferred in regulatory assets when recovery of such amounts is no longer considered probable.

Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit Plans

(a) Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy has LTIPs that provide for the issuance of stock-based incentives, including stock options, performance awards, restricted stock unit awards and restricted and unrestricted stock awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors.  Approximately


million

shares of Common Stock are authorized under these plans for awards. CenterPoint Energy issues new shares of its Common Stock to satisfy stock-based payments related to LTIPs. Equity awards are granted to employees without cost to the participants.

Compensation costs for the performance and stock unit awards granted under LTIPs are measured using fair value and expected achievement levels on the grant date. For performance awards with operational goals, the achievement levels are revised as goals are evaluated.  The fair value of awards granted to employees is based on the closing stock price of CenterPoint Energy’s Common Stock on the grant date. The compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical averages and estimates are updated periodically throughout the vesting period.


The performance awards granted in


,


and


are distributed based upon the achievement of certain objectives over a three-year performance cycle. The stock unit awards granted in


,


and


are service based. The stock unit awards generally vest at the end of a three-year period, provided, however, that stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vested at the end of a one-year period (for awards granted in 2017) or vested immediately upon grant (for awards granted in 2019 and 2018). Upon vesting, both the performance and stock unit awards are issued to the participants along with the value of dividend equivalents earned over the performance cycle or vesting period.

The following table summarizes CenterPoint Energy’s expenses related to LTIPs for

As of

December 31, 2019

, there was

$


million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance and stock awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.7

years.

(b) Pension Benefits (CenterPoint Energy)

CenterPoint Energy maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees, with benefits determined using a cash balance formula. In addition to the non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under CenterPoint Energy’s non-contributory qualified pension plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.

As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy now also maintains three additional qualified defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new participants and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. The defined benefit pension plans cover eligible full-time regular employees and retirees of Vectren and are primarily non-contributory.

CenterPoint Energy’s net periodic cost includes the following components relating to pension, including the non-qualified benefit plans:

(1)

Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals and amounts capitalized.

(2)

Amounts presented in the table above are included in Other, net in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals.

(3)

A one-time, non-cash settlement cost is required when the total lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic cost for that year.  In 2019, CenterPoint Energy recognized a non-cash settlement cost due to lump sum settlement payments.


(4)

A curtailment gain or loss is required when the expected future services of a significant number of employees are reduced or eliminated for the accrual of benefits. In 2019, CenterPoint Energy recognized a pension curtailment gain related to employees who were terminated after the Merger closed.

CenterPoint Energy used the following assumptions to determine net periodic cost relating to pension benefits:

In determining net periodic benefit cost, CenterPoint Energy uses fair value, as of the beginning of the year, as its basis for determining expected return on plan assets.

The following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets, the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as the key assumptions of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans. The measurement dates for plan assets and obligations were

December 31, 2019

and


.


(1)

Significant sources of loss for 2019 include the decrease in discount rate from

4.35

%

to

3.20

%

. Significant sources of gain for 2018 include the increase in discount rate from

3.65

%

to

4.35

%

and the mortality projection scale change from MP2017 to MP2018.

(2)

The discount rate assumption was determined by matching the projected cash flows of CenterPoint Energy’s plans against a hypothetical yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to 99 years.

(3)

The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of CenterPoint Energy’s plans and the expected return for each asset class.

The following table displays pension benefits related to CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets was

$

2,420

million

and

$

1,991

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Multi-employer Pension Plan

CenterPoint Energy, through its Infrastructure Services reportable segment, participates in several industry wide multi-employer pension plans for its collective bargaining employees which provide for monthly benefits based on length of service. The risks of participating in multi-employer pension plans are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (1) assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (2) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to such withdrawing employer may be borne by the remaining participating employers and (3) if CenterPoint Energy stops participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay those plans an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

Expense is recognized as payments are accrued for work performed or when withdrawal liabilities are probable and estimable. Expense associated with multi-employer plans of

$


million

during the year ended

December 31, 2019

. During


, CenterPoint Energy made contributions to these multi-employer plans on behalf of employees that participate in approximately


local unions. Contracts with these unions are negotiated with trade agreements through two primary contractor associations. These trade agreements have varying expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2022. The average contribution related to these local unions was less than

$


million

, and the largest contribution was approximately

$


million

. Multiple unions can contribute to a single multi-employer plan. CenterPoint Energy made contributions to at least


plans in 2019,

eight

of which are considered significant plans based on, among other things, the amount of the contributions, the number of employees participating in the plan, and the funded status of the plan.

CenterPoint Energy’s participation in the significant plans is outlined in the following table. The EIN / Pension Plan Number column provides the EIN and three-digit pension plan numbers. The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available in 2019 is for the plan year end at January 31, 2019 for the Central Pension Fund, May 31, 2019 for the Indiana Pension Laborers Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Pipeline Industry Benefit Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Laborers District Council & Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio, April 30, 2019 for the Ohio Operating Engineers Pension Fund, April 30, 2019 for the Operating Engineers Local 324 Fringe Benefit Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Minnesota Laborers Pension Fund, and December 31, 2018 for the Laborers’ Combined Fund of Western Pennsylvania. Generally, plans in the red zone are less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending / Implemented column indicates plans for which a FIP or RP is either pending or has been implemented. The multi-employer contributions listed in the table below are CenterPoint Energy’s multi-employer contributions made in 2019.

Federal law requires pensio

n plans in endangered status to adopt a FIP and plans in critical status to adopt a RP aimed at


restoring the financial health of the plan. In December 2014, the Multi-employer Pension Reform Act of 2014 was passed and permanently extended the Pension Protection Act of 2006 multi-employer plan critical and endangered status funding rules, among other things, including providing a provision for a plan sponsor to suspend or reduce benefit payments to preserve plans in critical and declining status.

(1)

The Operating Engineers Local #324 Fringe Benefits Fund was certified to be in “critical” status for the plan year ending April 30, 2019. In an effort to improve the plan’s funding situation, on March 17, 2011, the trustees adopted a plan amendment, which reduced benefit accruals and eliminated some ancillary benefits, and adopted an RP that will be effective from May 1, 2013 through April 30, 2023 or until the plan is no longer in critical status. On April 27, 2015, the trustees updated the RP to change the annual standard for meeting the requirements of the RP. The trustees further updated the RP on January 29, 2019. The annual standard is that actuarial projections updated for each year show the fund is expected to remain solvent for a 20-year projection period.

(2)

The Laborers’ Combined Fund of Western Pennsylvania was previously deemed in critical status. The trustees adopted a FIP that is scheduled to run through December 31, 2020 and provided for changes in adjustable benefits and increases in the employer contribution rate.

While not considered significant to CenterPoint Energy, there are

four

plans in red zone status receiving CenterPoint Energy contributions. There are also

five

other plans where CenterPoint Energy contributions exceed


%

of each plan’s total contributions; however,

none

of these plans are considered significant to CenterPoint Energy.

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. As a result, CenterPoint Energy will no longer participate in the multi-employer pension plans discussed above.

(c) Postretirement Benefits

CenterPoint Energy provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees on both a contributory and non-contributory basis. The Registrants’ employees (other than employees of Vectren and its subsidiaries) who were hired before January 1, 2018 and who have met certain age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans, are eligible to participate in these benefit plans. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2018 are not eligible for these benefits, except that such employees represented by IBEW Local Union 66 are eligible to participate in certain of the benefits, subject to the applicable age and service requirements. With respect to retiree medical and prescription drug benefits, employees represented by the IBEW Local Union 66 who retire on or after January 1, 2017, and their dependents, receive any such benefits exclusively through the NECA/IBEW Family Medical Care Plan pursuant to the terms of the renegotiated collective bargaining agreement entered into in May 2016. Houston Electric and CERC are required to fund a portion of their obligations in accordance with rate orders. All other obligations are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.


As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy now maintains an additional postretirement benefit plan. The postretirement benefit plan provides health care and life insurance benefits, which are a combination of self-insured and fully insured programs, to eligible Vectren retirees on both a contributory and non-contributory basis.

Postretirement benefits are accrued over the active service period of employees. The net postretirement benefit cost includes the following components:

(1)

Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in each of the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals and amounts capitalized.

(2)

Amounts presented in the table above are included in Other, net in each of the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals.

The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic cost relating to postretirement benefits:


The following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets, the amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets and the key assumptions of the postretirement plans. The measurement dates for plan assets and benefit obligations were

December 31, 2019

and


.

(1)

Significant sources of gain for 2019 include favorable cost trend rates and benefit claims experience in addition to the change in mortality projection scale from MP2018 to MP2019. Significant sources of gain for 2018 include the increase in the discount rate from

3.60

%

to

4.35

%

, favorable benefit claims experience and cost trend rates in addition to the change in mortality projection scale from MP2017 to MP2018.


(2)

The discount rate assumption was determined by matching the projected cash flows of the plans against a hypothetical yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to 99 years.

(3)

The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of the plans and the expected return for each asset class.

(d) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy recognizes the funded status of its pension and other postretirement plans on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent this obligation exceeds amounts previously recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Income, CenterPoint Energy records a regulatory asset for that portion related to its rate regulated utilities. To the extent that excess liability does not relate to a rate regulated utility, the offset is recorded as a reduction to equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss (gain) consist of the following:

The changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income during


are as follows:

(e) Pension Plan Assets (CenterPoint Energy)

In managing the investments associated with the benefit plans, CenterPoint Energy’s objective is to achieve and maintain a fully funded plan. This objective is expected to be achieved through an investment strategy that manages liquidity requirements while maintaining a long-term horizon in making investment decisions and efficient and effective management of plan assets.


As part of the investment strategy discussed above, CenterPoint Energy maintained the following weighted average allocation targets for its pension plans as of

December 31, 2019

:

The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy (see

The amounts invested in mutual funds and common collective trust funds were allocated as follows:

(1)

The amounts invested in international equities for 2018 include allocations of


%

in mutual funds and


%

in common collective trust funds,which were previously reported as allocations in emerging market equities.

The pension plans utilized both exchange traded and over-the-counter financial instruments such as futures, interest rate options and swaps that were marked to market daily with the gains/losses settled in the cash accounts. The pension plans did not include any holdings of CenterPoint Energy Common Stock as of

December 31, 2019

or


.


(f) Postretirement Plan Assets

In managing the investments associated with the postretirement plans, the Registrants’ objective is to achieve and maintain a fully funded plan. This objective is expected to be achieved through an investment strategy that manages liquidity requirements while maintaining a long-term horizon in making investment decisions and efficient and effective management of plan assets.

As part of the investment strategy discussed above, the Registrants maintained the following weighted average allocation targets for the postretirement plans as of

December 31, 2019

:

The following table presents mutual funds by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants’ postretirement plan assets at fair value as of

The amounts invested in mutual funds were allocated as follows:

(g) Benefit Plan Contributions

The Registrants made the following contributions in 2019 and expect to make the following minimum contributions in 2020 to the indicated benefit plans below:


The following benefit payments are expected to be paid by the pension and postretirement benefit plans:

(h) Savings Plan

CenterPoint Energy maintains the CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan, a tax-qualified employee savings plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, and an employee stock ownership plan under Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Under the plan, participating employees may make pre-tax or Roth contributions and, if eligible, after-tax contributions up to certain federally mandated limits. Participating Registrants provide matching contributions and, as of January 1, 2020, nonelective contributions, if eligible, up to certain limits. CenterPoint Energy, through the Merger, also acquired additional defined contribution retirement savings plans sponsored by Vectren and its subsidiaries that are qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, one of which merged into the CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan as of January 1, 2020.

The CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan has significant holdings of Common Stock. As of

December 31, 2019

,

11,051,800

shares of Common Stock were held by the savings plan, which represented approximately


%

of its investments. Given the concentration of the investments in Common Stock, the savings plan and its participants have market risk related to this investment. The savings plan limits the percentage of future contributions that can be invested in Common Stock to


%

and prohibits transfers of account balances where the transfer would result in more than


%

of a participant’s total account balance invested in Common Stock.

CenterPoint Energy allocates the savings plan benefit expense to Houston Electric and CERC related to their respective employees. The following table summarizes the Registrants’ savings plan benefit expense for


,


and


:

(1)

Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in the Registrants’ respective  Statements of Consolidated Income and shown prior to any amounts capitalized.

(i) Other Benefits Plans

The Registrants participate in CenterPoint Energy’s plans that provide postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents, after employment but before retirement (primarily healthcare and life insurance benefits for participants in the long-term disability plan).

CenterPoint Energy maintains non-qualified deferred compensation plans, including plans acquired in the Merger, that provide benefits payable to eligible directors, officers and select employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates or upon termination, retirement or death. Benefit payments are made from the general assets of the participating Registrants.


Expenses related to other benefit plans were recorded as follows:

Amounts related to other benefit plans were included in Benefit Obligations in the Registrants’ accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

(j) Change in Control Agreements and Other Employee Matters

CenterPoint Energy has a change in control plan, which was amended and restated on May 1, 2017. The plan generally provides, to the extent applicable, in the case of a change in control of CenterPoint Energy and covered termination of employment, for severance benefits of up to

three

times annual base salary plus bonus, and other benefits. Certain CenterPoint Energy officers, including the Executive Chairman, are participants under the plan.

Certain key employees of Vectren and its subsidiaries have change in control agreements or employment agreements that provide payments and other benefits upon a covered termination of employment.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Registrants’ employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as follows:

(1)

Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations. The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA.  These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborer’s International Union of North America, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, and Teamsters. The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.  These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.


(9)

Derivative Instruments

The Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. The Registrants utilize derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on operating results and cash flows.

(a) Non-Trading Activities

Commodity Derivative Instruments (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

CenterPoint Energy, through its Indiana utilities, and CERC, through CES, enter into certain derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of commodity price movements. Certain financial instruments used to hedge portions of the natural gas inventory of the Energy Services reportable segment are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. Outstanding derivative instruments designated as economic hedges at the Indiana Utilities hedge long-term variable rate natural gas purchases. The Indiana Utilities have authority to refund and recover mark-to-market gains and losses associated with hedging natural gas purchases, and thus the gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in a regulatory liability or asset. All other financial instruments do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.

Interest Rate Risk Derivative Instruments.

From time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives that are designated as economic or cash flow hedges. The objective of these hedges is to offset risk associated with interest rates borne by the Registrants in connection with an anticipated future fixed rate debt offering or other exposure to variable rate debt. The Indiana Utilities have authority to refund and recover mark-to-market gains and losses associated with hedging financing activity, and thus the gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in a regulatory liability or asset. For the impacts of cash flow hedges to Accumulated other comprehensive income, see

Note 13

.

The table below summarizes the Registrants’ outstanding interest rate hedging activity:

(1)

Relates to interest rate derivative instruments at SIGECO.

Weather Hedges (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

CenterPoint Energy and CERC have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that largely mitigate the impact of weather on NGD in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota, Ohio and Oklahoma, as applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD in Texas and CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations in Texas and Indiana do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for NGD compared to its other jurisdictions. As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s results in Texas and on CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations’ results in its Texas and Indiana service territories.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, enter into winter season weather hedges from time to time for certain NGD jurisdictions and electric operations’ service territory to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather on results of operations and cash flows. These weather hedges are based on heating degree days at


-year normal weather. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not enter into weather hedges.


The tables below summarizes CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s weather hedge gain (loss) activity:

(c) Credit Risk Contingent Features (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy and CERC enter into financial derivative contracts containing material adverse change provisions. These provisions could require CenterPoint Energy or CERC to post additional collateral if the S&P or Moody’s credit ratings of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or its subsidiaries, including CERC Corp., are downgraded.

(d) Credit Quality of Counterparties (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

In addition to the risk associated with price movements, credit risk is also inherent in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s non-trading derivative activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty. The following tables show the composition of counterparties to the non-trading derivative assets:

CenterPoint Energy

CERC

(1)

“Investment grade” is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings and considers credit support (including parent company guarantees) and collateral (including cash and standby letters of credit). For unrated counterparties, CERC determines a synthetic credit rating by performing financial statement analysis and consider contractual rights and restrictions and collateral.


(2)

End users are comprised primarily of customers who have contracted to fix the price of a portion of their physical gas requirements for future periods.

(3)

The amounts reflected in the table above were not impacted by collateral netting.

Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined below and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities, as well as natural gas inventory that has been designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge.

Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets. A market approach is utilized to value the Registrants’ Level 2 natural gas derivative assets or liabilities. CenterPoint Energy’s Level 2 indexed debt securities derivative is valued using an option model and a discounted cash flow model, which uses projected dividends on the ZENS-Related Securities and a discount rate as observable inputs.

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the Registrants’ judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. The Registrants develop these inputs based on the best information available, including the Registrants’ own data. A market approach is utilized to value the Registrants’ Level 3 assets or liabilities. As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Level 3 assets and liabilities are comprised of physical natural gas forward contracts and options.  Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts and options are valued using a discounted cash flow model which includes illiquid forward price curve locations (ranging from

$

1.44

to

$

5.20

per MMBtu for CenterPoint Energy and from

$

1.44

to

$

5.20

per MMBtu for CERC) as an unobservable input. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts and options derivative assets and liabilities consist of both long and short positions (forwards and options). Forward price decreases (increases) as of

December 31, 2019

would have resulted in lower (higher) values, respectively, for long forwards and options and higher (lower) values, respectively, for short forwards and options.

The Registrants determine the appropriate level for each financial asset and liability on a quarterly basis and recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.

The following tables present information about the Registrants’ assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Registrants to determine such fair value.

CenterPoint Energy


Houston Electric

CERC

(1)

Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting arrangements that allow CenterPoint Energy and CERC to settle positive and negative positions and also include cash collateral posted with the same counterparties as follows:

(2)

Amounts are included in Prepaid and Other Current Assets and Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(3)

Natural gas derivatives include no material amounts related to physical forward transactions with Enable.


(4)

Level 1 natural gas derivatives include exchange-traded derivatives cleared by the CME, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with posted cash payments.  As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes, and are presented in Level 1 net of posted cash; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

The following table presents additional information about assets or liabilities, including derivatives that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC have utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value:

(1)

During 2018, CenterPoint Energy transferred its indexed debt securities derivative from Level 3 to Level 2 to reflect changes in the significance of the unobservable inputs used in the valuation.

(2)

CenterPoint Energy and CERC did not have significant Level 3 purchases or sales during any of the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


or 2017.

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities classified as “trading” and short-term borrowings are estimated to be approximately equivalent to carrying amounts and have been excluded from the table below. The carrying amounts of non-trading derivative assets and liabilities and CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS indexed debt securities derivative are stated at fair value and are excluded from the table below. The fair value of each debt instrument is determined by multiplying the principal amount of each debt instrument by a combination of historical trading prices and comparable issue data. These liabilities, which are not measured at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, but for which the fair value is disclosed, would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

(1)

Includes Securitization Bond debt.

Items measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis

CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

Unconsolidated Affiliates (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy has the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of Enable, a publicly traded MLP, and, accordingly, accounts for its investment in Enable’s common units using the equity method of accounting. Enable is considered to be a VIE because the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Enable’s economic performance does not reside with the holders of equity investment at risk. However, CenterPoint Energy is not considered the primary beneficiary of Enable since it does not have the power to direct the activities of Enable that are considered most significant to the economic performance of Enable. As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy’s maximum exposure to loss related to Enable is limited to its investment in unconsolidated affiliate, its investment in Enable Series A Preferred Units and outstanding current accounts receivable from Enable.

Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates (CenterPoint Energy):

(1)

Represents the fair value of non-utility equity investments acquired in the Merger.

CenterPoint Energy evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in value of its investment has occurred and the carrying amount of its investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is

$

10.29

per unit and Enable’s common unit price closed at

$

10.03

per unit (approximately

$


million

below carrying value). Based on an analysis of its investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of its investment is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of

$

2.4

billion

will be recovered.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates, net (CenterPoint Energy):

(1)

Equity earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes CenterPoint Energy’s share of Enable’s

$


million

goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Limited Partner Interest and Units Held in Enable (CenterPoint Energy):

(1)

Excludes the Enable Series A Preferred Units owned by CenterPoint Energy.

(2)

The carrying amount of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, reflected as Preferred units - unconsolidated affiliate on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, was

$


million

as of both

December 31, 2019

and


. No


impairment charges or adjustment to carrying value were made as no observable price changes were identified in the current or prior reporting periods.

(3)

Prior to the Internal Spin completed in September 2018, CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable’s common units, excluding the Enable Series A Preferred Units held directly by CenterPoint Energy, was held indirectly through CERC.

Generally, sales to any person or entity (including a series of sales to the same person or entity) of more than


%

of the aggregate of the common units CenterPoint Energy owns in Enable or sales to any person or entity (including a series of sales to the same person or entity) by OGE of more than


%

of the aggregate of the common units it owns in Enable are subject to mutual rights of first offer and first refusal set forth in Enable’s Agreement of Limited Partnership.

Interests Held in Enable GP (CenterPoint Energy):

CenterPoint Energy and OGE held the following interests in Enable GP as of both

December 31, 2019

and


:

(1)

As of

December 31, 2019

, Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE. Sale of CenterPoint Energy’s or OGE’s ownership interests in Enable GP to a third party is subject to mutual rights of first offer and first refusal, and CenterPoint Energy is not permitted to dispose of less than all of its interest in Enable GP.

(2)

Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of

$

0.2875

per common unit on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates, within 60 days after the end of each quarter. If cash distributions to Enable’s unitholders exceed

$

0.330625

per common unit in any quarter, Enable GP will receive increasing percentages or incentive distributions rights, up to


%

, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. In certain circumstances Enable GP will have the right to reset the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels at which the incentive distributions receive increasing percentages to higher levels based on Enable’s cash distributions at the time of the exercise of this reset election. To date, no incentive distributions have been made.

Held indirectly through CNP Midstream.

Distributions Received from Enable (CenterPoint Energy and CERC):

CenterPoint Energy

CERC


(1)

Prior to the Internal Spin completed in September 2018, distributions from Enable were received by CERC. After such date, distributions from Enable were received directly by CenterPoint Energy (through CNP Midstream).

Transactions with Enable (CenterPoint Energy and CERC):

(1)

Included in Non-utility costs of revenues, including natural gas on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s respective Statements of Consolidated Income.

(2)

Represents amounts billed for certain support services provided to Enable. Actual support services costs are recorded net of reimbursement.

CERC’s continuing involvement with Enable subsequent to the Internal Spin is limited to its natural gas purchases from Enable.

Summarized consolidated income (loss) information for Enable is as follows:

(1)

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate includes CenterPoint Energy’s share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of CenterPoint Energy’s original investment in Enable and its underlying equity in net assets of Enable. The basis difference is being amortized through the year 2048.


Summarized consolidated balance sheet information for Enable is as follows:

Discontinued Operations (CERC):

On September 4, 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin. CERC executed the Internal Spin to, among other things, enhance the access of CERC and CenterPoint Energy to low cost debt and equity through increased transparency and understandability of the financial statements, improve CERC’s credit quality by eliminating the exposure to Enable’s midstream business and provide clarity of internal reporting and performance metrics to enhance management’s decision making for CERC and CNP Midstream.

The Internal Spin represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on CERC’s operations and financial results and, as a result, CERC’s distribution of its equity investment in Enable met the criteria for discontinued operations classification. CERC has no continuing involvement in the equity investment of Enable. Therefore, CERC’s equity in earnings and related income taxes have been classified as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented. CERC’s equity method investment and related deferred income tax liabilities have been classified as Investment in unconsolidated affiliate - discontinued operations and Deferred income taxes, net - discontinued operations, respectively, in CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented. The following table presents amounts included in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Indexed Debt Securities (ZENS) and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy)

(a) Investment in Securities Related to ZENS

A subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy holds shares of certain securities detailed in the table below, which are classified as trading securities and are expected to be held to facilitate CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its obligation under the ZENS. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value of the ZENS-Related Securities are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

(b) ZENS

In September 1999, CenterPoint Energy issued ZENS having an original principal amount of

$

1.0

billion

of which

$


million

remained outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

. Each ZENS is exchangeable at the holder’s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to


%

of the market value of the reference shares attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS are adjusted for certain corporate events.

CenterPoint Energy’s reference shares for each ZENS consisted of the following:

CenterPoint Energy pays interest on the ZENS at an annual rate of


%

plus the amount of any quarterly cash dividends paid in respect of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. The principal amount of the ZENS is subject to increases or decreases to the extent that the annual yield from interest and cash dividends on the reference shares is less than or more than

2.309

%

. The adjusted principal amount is defined in the ZENS instrument as “contingent principal.” As of

December 31, 2019

, the ZENS, having an original principal amount of

$


million

and a contingent principal amount of

$


million

, were outstanding and were exchangeable, at the option of the holders, for cash equal to


%

of the market value of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. As of

December 31, 2019

, the market value of such shares was approximately

$


million

, which would provide an exchange amount of

$


for each

$

1,000

original principal amount of ZENS. At maturity of the ZENS in


, CenterPoint Energy will be obligated to pay in cash the higher of the contingent principal amount of the ZENS or an amount based on the then-current market value of the reference shares, which will include any additional publicly-traded securities distributed with respect to the current reference shares prior to maturity.

The ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component (the holder’s option to receive the appreciated value of the reference shares at maturity). The bifurcated debt component accretes through interest charges annually up to the contingent principal amount of the ZENS in 2029. Such accretion will be reduced by annual cash interest payments, as described above. The derivative component is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative component are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS.


The following table sets forth summarized financial information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s investment in ZENS-Related Securities and each component of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation.

Ranking.

The Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to anticipated dividends and distributions upon CenterPoint Energy’s liquidation or dissolution, or winding-up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs, ranks or will rank:

•

senior to Common Stock and to each other class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series A Preferred Stock;

•

on a parity with any class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series A Preferred Stock, including the Series B Preferred Stock;

•

junior to any class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is expressly made senior to the Series A Preferred Stock;

•

junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under CenterPoint Energy’s credit facilities, senior notes and commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against CenterPoint Energy; and

•

structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries and capital stock of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries held by third parties.

Voting Rights.

Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock generally will not have voting rights. Whenever dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the dividend period beginning on, and including, the original issue date and ending on, but excluding, March 1, 2019), whether or not consecutive, the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined in the Statement of Resolution for the Series A Preferred Stock) then outstanding, will be entitled at CenterPoint Energy’s next annual or special meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations.  This right will terminate if and when all accumulated dividends have been paid in full and, upon such termination, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate at such time and the number of directors on CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors will automatically decrease by two, subject to the revesting of such rights in the event of each subsequent nonpayment.

Series B Preferred Stock

On October 1, 2018, CenterPoint Energy completed the issuance of

19,550,000

depositary shares, each representing a

1/20th

interest in a share of its Series B Preferred Stock, at a price of

$


per depositary share, resulting in net proceeds of

$


million

after issuance costs.  The aggregate liquidation value of Series B Preferred Stock is

$


million

with a per share liquidation value of

$

1,000

. The amount issued included

2,550,000

depositary shares issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional depositary shares.

CenterPoint Energy used the net proceeds from the offering of depositary shares, each representing a

1/20th

interest in a share of its Series B Preferred Stock, to fund a portion of the Merger and to pay related fees and expenses.


Dividends.

Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared at an annual rate of

7.00

%

on the liquidation value of

$

1,000

per share. CenterPoint Energy may pay declared dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of Common Stock, or in any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2018 and ending on, and including, September 1, 2021. Cumulative dividends earned during the applicable periods are presented on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income as Preferred stock dividend requirement.

Mandatory Conversion.

Unless earlier converted or redeemed, each share of the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be September 1, 2021, into not less than

30.5820

and not more than

36.6980

shares of Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Correspondingly, the conversion rate per depositary share will be not less than

1.5291

and not more than

1.8349

shares of Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The conversion rate will be determined based on a preceding 20-day volume-weighted-average-price of Common Stock.

The following table illustrates the conversion rate per share of the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments:

The following table illustrates the conversion rate per depositary share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments:

Optional Conversion of the Holder.

Other than during a fundamental change conversion period, and unless CenterPoint Energy has redeemed the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of the Series B Preferred Stock may, at any time prior to September 1, 2021, elect to convert such holder’s shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at the minimum conversion rate of

30.5820

shares of Common Stock per share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to

1.5291

shares of Common Stock per depositary share), subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. Because each depositary share represents a

1/20th

fractional interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares only in lots of


depositary shares.

Fundamental Change Conversion.

If a fundamental change occurs on or prior to September 1, 2021, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to convert their shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the fundamental change conversion rate during the period beginning on, and including, the effective date of such fundamental change and ending on, and including, the date that is


calendar days after such effective date (or, if later, the date that is


calendar days after holders receive notice of such fundamental change, but in no event later than September 1, 2021). Holders who convert shares of the Series B Preferred Stock during that period will also receive a make-whole dividend amount comprised of a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount, and to the extent there is any, the accumulated dividend amount. Because each depositary share represents a

1/20th

fractional interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares upon a fundamental change only in lots of


depositary shares.

Ranking.

The Series B Preferred Stock, with respect to anticipated dividends and distributions upon CenterPoint Energy’s liquidation or dissolution, or winding-up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs, ranks or will rank:

•

senior to Common Stock and to each other class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date of the Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series B Preferred Stock;

•

on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series B Preferred Stock;

•

junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under CenterPoint Energy’s credit facilities, senior notes and commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against CenterPoint Energy; and

•

structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries and capital stock of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries held by third parties.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt


(1)

Includes amounts due or exchangeable within one year of the date noted.

(2)

CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and an embedded derivative component. For additional information regarding ZENS, see Note 12(b). As ZENS are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders, these notes are classified as a current portion of long-term debt.

(3)

Includes

$


million

of senior notes issued by VUHI and

$


million

of senior notes issued by Indiana Gas. The senior notes have stated interest rates that range from

3.72

%

to

7.08

%

. The senior notes issued by VUHI are guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. In connection with the Merger, two of CenterPoint Energy’s acquired wholly-owned subsidiaries, VUHI and VCC, made offers to prepay certain outstanding guaranteed senior notes as required pursuant to certain note purchase agreements previously entered into by VUHI and VCC. In turn, VUHI and VCC borrowed

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, from CenterPoint Energy to fund note redemptions of senior notes effected pursuant to these prepayment offers. To fund these prepayments and payments of approximately

$


million

of accrued interest, CenterPoint Energy issued approximately

$


million

of commercial paper.

(4)

The first mortgage bonds issued by SIGECO subject SIGECO’s properties to a lien under the related mortgage indenture.

(5)

$


million

and

$


million

of these series of debt were secured by general mortgage bonds of Houston Electric as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. These general mortgage bonds are not reflected in Houston Electric’s consolidated financial statements because of the contingent nature of the obligations.

(6)

Classified as long-term debt because the termination date of the facility that backstops the commercial paper is more than one year from the date noted.


(7)

Commercial paper issued by VUHI has maturities up to


days.

In December 2019, VCC redeemed the aggregate principal amount of its guaranteed senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the redemption date, plus the make-whole premium.  The make-whole premium associated with the two redemptions was approximately

$


million

and was included in Other Income, net on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Debt Transactions.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, the following debt instruments were issued or incurred:

(1)

Draw down by VCC on its variable rate term loan.

Securitization Bonds.

As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which they consolidate. The consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of transition bonds or system restoration bonds and activities incidental thereto. These Securitization Bonds are payable only through the imposition and collection of “transition” or “system restoration” charges, as defined in the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, which are irrevocable, non-bypassable charges to provide recovery of authorized qualified costs. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have no payment obligations in respect of the Securitization Bonds other than to remit the applicable transition or system restoration charges they collect as set forth in servicing agreements among Houston Electric, the Bond Companies and other parties. Each special purpose entity is the sole owner of the right to impose, collect and receive the applicable transition or system restoration charges securing the bonds issued by that entity. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric have no recourse to any assets or revenues of the Bond Companies (including the transition and system restoration charges), and the holders of Securitization Bonds have no recourse to the assets or revenues of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric.

In January 2019, CenterPoint Energy issued the following commercial paper in connection with the closing of the Merger:

(1)

Proceeds from these commercial paper issuances were used to fund a portion of the Merger and to pay related fees and expenses and were contributed to Vectren for its payment of its stub period cash dividend, long-term incentive payments and to fund the repayment of indebtedness of Vectren subsidiaries redeemed at the option of the holder as a result of the closing of the Merger.

(2)

The commercial paper notes were issued at various times in January 2019 with maturities up to and including


days as of the time of issuance, and, prior to their use as described in connection with the closing of the Merger, the net proceeds of such issuances were invested in short-term investments.

Maturities.

As of

December 31, 2019

, maturities of long-term debt, capital leases and sinking fund requirements, excluding the ZENS obligation, are as follows:

(1)

These maturities include Securitization Bonds principal repayments on scheduled payment dates.

Liens.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric’s assets were subject to liens securing approximately

$


million

of first mortgage bonds. Sinking or improvement fund and replacement fund requirements on the first mortgage bonds may be satisfied by certification of property additions. Sinking fund and replacement fund requirements for


,


and


have been satisfied by certification of property additions. The replacement fund requirement to be satisfied in


is approximately

$


million

, and the sinking fund requirement to be satisfied in


is approximately

$

1.6

million

. CenterPoint Energy expects Houston Electric to meet these


obligations by certification of property additions.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Houston Electric’s assets were also subject to liens securing approximately

$

4.0

billion

of general mortgage bonds, including approximately

$


million

held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. The lien of the general mortgage indenture is junior to that of the mortgage pursuant to which the first mortgage bonds are issued. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds,


%

of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately

$

3.7

billion

of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and


%

of property additions as of

December 31, 2019

. Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.

Other.

As of

December 31, 2019

, certain financial institutions agreed to issue, from time to time, up to

$


million

of letters of credit on behalf of Vectren and certain of its subsidiaries in exchange for customary fees. These agreements to issue letters of credit expire on December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, such financial institutions had issued

$


million

of letters of credit on behalf of Vectren and certain of its subsidiaries.


(15)

Income Taxes

The components of the Registrant’ income tax expense (benefit) were as follows:


A reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) using the federal statutory income tax rate to the actual income tax expense and resulting effective income tax rate is as follows:


(1)

Recognized a

$


million

benefit for the amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions, a

$


million

net benefit for the impact of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes in those jurisdictions, and

$


million

net benefit for the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.

(2)

Recognized a

$


million

deferred tax expense due to state law changes that resulted in remeasurement of state deferred taxes in those jurisdictions. Also recorded an additional

$


million

valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized prior to expiration after the Internal Spin. These items are partially offset by

$


million

of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions beginning in 2018.

(3)

Recognized a

$

1.1

billion

deferred tax benefit from the remeasurement of CenterPoint Energy’s ADFIT liability as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from


%

to


%

.

(4)

Recognized

$


million

of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators.

(5)

Recognized

$


million

of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions beginning in 2018.

(6)

Recognized a

$


million

deferred tax benefit from the remeasurement of Houston Electric’s ADFIT liability as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from


%

to


%

.

(7)

Recognized

$


million

benefit for the amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions,

$


million

net benefit for the impact of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes in those jurisdictions and

$


million

net benefit for the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.

(8)

Recorded an additional

$


million

valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized prior to expiration after the Internal Spin. This item is partially offset by

$


million

of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability in certain jurisdictions as decreed by regulators beginning in 2018.

(9)

Recognized a

$


million

deferred tax benefit from the remeasurement of CERC’s ADFIT liability as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from


%

to


%

. ASC 740 requires tax impacts of changes in tax laws or rates be reported in continuing operations. Therefore, CERC’s federal income tax benefit generated by the remeasurement of the ADFIT liability for Enable during 2017 and state law changes during 2016 associated with its investment in Enable are reported in continuing operations on CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income. The ADFIT liability associated with CERC’s investment in Enable is reported as discontinued operations on CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:


Merger with Vectren

.  On  Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately

$


billion

in cash.  On the Merger Date, Vectren became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy which triggered an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code.  Under this Code section, future utilization of acquired net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes can be limited. On the Merger Date, Vectren  estimated

$


million

and

$


million

of federal net operating loss and of charitable contribution carryforwards, respectively, the utilization of which is not expected to be limited under Section 382.

Tax Attribute Carryforwards and Valuation Allowance

.  CenterPoint Energy has no federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019.  Also, CenterPoint Energy has

$


million

of federal charitable contribution carryforwards, which have a five-year carryover period. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy had

$


million

of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2020 and 2039 and

$


million

of state tax credits that do not expire. CenterPoint Energy reported a valuation allowance of

$


million

because it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.

CERC has

$


million

of federal net operating loss carryforwards which have an indefinite carryforward period. CERC has

$


million

of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire between 2020 and 2039 and

$


million

of state tax credits which do not expire. CERC reported a valuation allowance of

$


million

since it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.

A reconciliation of CenterPoint Energy’s beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for 2019 is as follows:

CenterPoint Energy had no unrecognized tax benefits for 2018 and 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy acquired

$


million

of unrecognized tax benefits in connection with the Merger.  Included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 are

$


million

of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The above table does not include an immaterial amount of accrued interest as of December 31, 2019. The Registrants recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. The Registrants believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to

$


million

in unrecognized tax benefits may occur by the end of 2020 as a result of a lapse of statutes on older exposures and/or the filing of applications for accounting method changes. CenterPoint Energy’s net unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, were

$


million

as of December 31, 2019 and are included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Tax Audits and Settlements

. Tax years through 2017 have been audited and settled with the IRS for CenterPoint Energy. For the 2018 and 2019 tax years, the Registrants are participants in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process. Legacy Vectren is not currently under audit with the IRS, and the 2017-2019 tax years are still open.

(16)

Commitments and Contingencies

(a) Purchase Obligations (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

Commitments include minimum purchase obligations related to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments and CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment. Contracts with minimum payment provisions have various quantity requirements and durations and are not classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

and


. These contracts meet an exception as “normal purchases contracts” or do not meet the definition of a derivative. Natural gas and coal supply commitments also include transportation contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative.


As of

December 31, 2019

, minimum purchase obligations are approximately:

Indiana Electric also has other purchased power agreements that do not have minimum thresholds but do require payment when energy is generated by the provider. Costs arising from certain of these commitments are pass-through costs, generally collected dollar-for-dollar from retail customers through regulator-approved cost recovery mechanisms.

(b) AMAs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2023. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs.

(c) Guarantees and Product Warranties (CenterPoint Energy)

In the normal course of business, ESG enters into contracts requiring it to timely install infrastructure, operate facilities, pay vendors and subcontractors and support warranty obligations and, at times, issue payment and performance bonds and other forms of assurance in connection with these contracts.

Specific to ESG’s role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry, as of

December 31, 2019

, there were


open surety bonds supporting future performance with an aggregate face amount of approximately

$


million

. ESG’s exposure is less than the face amount of the surety bonds and is limited to the level of uncompleted work under the contracts. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately


%

of the work was yet to be completed on projects with open surety bonds. Further, various subcontractors issue surety bonds to ESG. In addition to these performance obligations, ESG also warrants the functionality of certain installed infrastructure generally for one year and the associated energy savings over a specified number of years. Since ESG’s inception in 1994, CenterPoint Energy believes ESG has had a history of generally meeting its performance obligations and energy savings guarantees and its installed products operating effectively. CenterPoint Energy assessed the fair value of its obligation for such guarantees as of

December 31, 2019

and no amounts were recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

CenterPoint Energy issues parent company level guarantees to certain vendors, customers and other commercial counterparties of ESG. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, represent guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow those subsidiaries to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy, primarily through Vectren, has issued parent company level guarantees supporting ESG’s obligations. For those obligations where potential exposure can be estimated, management estimates the maximum exposure under these guarantees to be approximately

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

. This exposure primarily relates to energy savings guarantees on federal energy savings performance contracts. Other parent company level guarantees, certain of which do not contain a cap on potential liability, have been issued in support of federal operations and maintenance projects for which a maximum exposure cannot be estimated based on the nature of the projects. While there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company


guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy considers the likelihood of a material amount being incurred as remote.

(d) Guarantees and Product Warranties (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

In the normal course of business, CES trades natural gas under supply contracts and enters into natural gas related transactions under transportation, storage and other contracts.  In connection with these CES business activities, CERC Corp. has issued guarantees to CES counterparties to guarantee the payment of CES obligations.  While CES remains wholly-owned by CERC Corp., these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, represent guarantees of CES’s obligations to allow CES to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance.  As of December 31, 2019, the face amount of CERC Corp.’s guarantees of CES obligations was approximately $

1.8

billion

.

A CERC Corp. guarantee primarily has a one- or two-year term, although CERC Corp. would generally not be released from obligations incurred by CES prior to the termination of such guarantee unless the beneficiary of the guarantee affirmatively released CERC Corp.  from its obligations under the guarantee.  Since CERC Corp. has owned CES, CERC Corp. has not paid any amounts under any guarantees of CES obligations.  While there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy and CERC consider the likelihood of a material amount being incurred as remote.

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment.  Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, Athena Energy Services must generally use reasonable best efforts to replace existing CERC Corp. guarantees with credit support provided by a party other than CERC Corp. as of and after closing of the sale.  Additionally, to the extent that CERC Corp. retains any exposure relating to the guarantees of CES obligations 90 days after closing, Athena Energy Services will pay a


%

annualized fee on such exposure, increasing by


%

on an annualized basis every three months.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded

no

amounts on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 related to these guarantees.

(e) Legal, Environmental and Other Matters

Legal Matters

Gas Market Manipulation Cases (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

. CenterPoint Energy, its predecessor, Reliant Energy, and certain of their former subsidiaries were named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits filed against numerous gas market participants in a number of federal and western state courts in connection with the operation of the natural gas markets in 2000-2002. CenterPoint Energy and its affiliates were released or dismissed from all such cases, except for one case in federal court in Nevada in which CES, a subsidiary of CERC, was a defendant. Plaintiffs in that case alleged a conspiracy to inflate Wisconsin natural gas prices in 2000-2002. In October 2018, CES reached an agreement to settle all claims against CES and CES’s claims for indemnity.  During the third quarter of 2019, the federal district court issued final approval of the settlement and dismissed the case, and CES completed the required settlement payments; the settlement agreement has now become final. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Minnehaha Academy (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

On August 2, 2017, a natural gas explosion occurred at the Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, resulting in the deaths of two school employees, serious injuries to others and significant property damage to the school. CenterPoint Energy, certain of its subsidiaries, including CERC, and the contractor company working in the school have been named in litigation arising out of this incident. CenterPoint Energy and CERC have reached confidential settlement agreements on all wrongful death and property damage claims and with some personal injury claimants. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy and CERC cooperated with the investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, which concluded its investigation in December 2019 and issued a report without making any recommendations. Further, CenterPoint Energy and CERC contested and reached a settlement regarding approximately

$

200,000

in fines imposed by the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety.  In early 2018, the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded its investigation without any adverse findings against CenterPoint Energy or CERC. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s general and excess liability insurance policies provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims.

Litigation Related to the Merger (CenterPoint Energy).

With respect to the Merger, in July 2018, seven separate lawsuits were filed against Vectren and the individual directors of Vectren’s Board of Directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. These lawsuits alleged violations of Sections 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 on the grounds that the Vectren Proxy Statement filed on June 18, 2018 was materially incomplete because it omitted material information concerning the Merger. In August 2018, the seven lawsuits were consolidated, and the Court denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary


injunction. In October 2018, the plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. In December 2018, two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuits. In September 2019, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the remaining plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice, which the plaintiffs appealed in October 2019. The defendants believe that the allegations asserted are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against the claims raised. CenterPoint Energy does not expect the ultimate outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

MGP Sites.

CenterPoint Energy, CERC and their predecessors operated MGPs in the past. In addition, certain of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries acquired through the Merger operated MGPs in the past. The costs CenterPoint Energy or CERC, as applicable, expect to incur to fulfill their respective obligations are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred, the timing of expected future payments and inflation factors, among others. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC have recorded all costs which they presently are obligated to incur in connection with activities at these sites, it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen, and those costs may not be subject to PRP or insurance recovery.

(i)

Minnesota MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

. With respect to certain Minnesota MGP sites, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have completed state-ordered remediation and continue state-ordered monitoring and water treatment. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a liability as reflected in the table below for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in Minnesota.

(ii)

Indiana MGPs (CenterPoint Energy)

. In the Indiana Gas service territory, the existence, location and certain general characteristics of


gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which CenterPoint Energy may have some remedial responsibility. A remedial investigation/feasibility study was completed at one of the sites under an agreed upon order between Indiana Gas and the IDEM, and a Record of Decision was issued by the IDEM in January 2000. The remaining sites have been submitted to the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy has also identified its involvement in five manufactured gas plant sites in SIGECO’s service territory, all of which are currently enrolled in the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy is currently conducting some level of remedial activities, including groundwater monitoring at certain sites.

(iii)

Other MGPs

(CenterPoint Energy and CERC).

In addition to the Minnesota and Indiana sites, the EPA and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CenterPoint Energy or CERC or may have been owned by one of their former affiliates.

Total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time. The estimated accrued costs are limited to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other PRPs. The estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC believe they may have responsibility was based on remediation continuing for the minimum time frame given in the table below.

The cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual remediation costs will depend on the number of sites to be remediated, the participation of other PRPs, if any, and the remediation methods used.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC do not expect the ultimate outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either CenterPoint Energy or CERC.

Asbestos.

Some facilities owned by the Registrants or their predecessors contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestos-containing materials. The Registrants are from time to time named, along with numerous others, as defendants in


lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos, and the Registrants anticipate that additional claims may be asserted in the future. Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

CCR Rule (CenterPoint Energy).

In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be reused. In July 2018, the EPA released its final CCR Rule Phase I Reconsideration which extended the deadline to October 31, 2020 for ceasing placement of ash in ponds that exceed groundwater protections standards or that fail to meet location restrictions. While the EPA Phase I Reconsideration moves forward, the existing CCR compliance obligations remain in effect. In August 2019, the EPA proposed additional amendments to its CCR Rule with respect to beneficial reuse of ash and other materials. The proposed revisions would not restrict Indiana Electric’s current beneficial reuse of its fly ash.

Indiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. Under the existing CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place, with bottom ash handling conversions completed. Indiana Electric’s Warrick generating unit is not included in the scope of the CCR Rule as this unit has historically been part of a larger generating station that predominantly serves an adjacent industrial facility. In March 2018, Indiana Electric began posting ground water data monitoring reports annually to its public website in accordance with the requirements of the CCR Rule. This data preliminarily indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric’s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing. The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric is required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by October 31, 2020. CenterPoint Energy plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including the imposition of fines and penalties. On April 24, 2019, Indiana Electric received an order from the IURC approving recovery in rates of costs associated with the closure of the Culley West pond, which has already commenced closure activities. CenterPoint Energy believes the language in the IURC order is favorable for future recovery of closure costs for Indiana Electric’s remaining ponds.

Indiana Electric continues to refine site specific estimates of closure costs. In July 2018, Indiana Electric filed a Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief against its insurers seeking reimbursement of defense, investigation and pond closure costs incurred to comply with the CCR Rule, and has since reached confidential settlement agreements with its insurers. The proceeds of these settlements will offset costs that have been and will be incurred to close the ponds. In March 2019, Indiana Electric entered into agreements with third parties for the excavation and beneficial reuse of the ash at the A.B. Brown ash pond. On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed its petition with the IURC for recovery of costs associated with the closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond, which would include costs associated with the excavation and recycling of the ponded ash. On November 4, 2019, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of proposed revisions to the CCR Rule. CenterPoint Energy will evaluate the proposals to determine potential impacts to current compliance plans for its A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley generating stations.

As of

December 31, 2019

, CenterPoint Energy has recorded an approximate

$


million

ARO, which represents the discounted value of future cash flow estimates to close the ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. This estimate is subject to change due to the contractual arrangements; continued assessments of the ash, closure methods, and the timing of closure; implications of Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; changing environmental regulations; and proceeds received from the settlements in the aforementioned insurance proceeding. In addition to these removal costs, Indiana Electric also anticipates equipment purchases of between

$


million

and

$


million

to complete the A.B. Brown closure project.

Other Environmental.

From time to time, the Registrants identify the presence of environmental contaminants during operations or on property where predecessors have conducted operations. Other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future. The Registrants have and expect to continue to remediate any identified sites consistent with state and federal legal obligations. From time to time, the Registrants have received notices, and may receive notices in the future, from regulatory authorities or others regarding status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants.  In addition, the Registrants have been, or may be, named from time to time as defendants in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Other Proceedings

The Registrants are involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Registrants are also defendants in legal proceedings with respect to claims brought by various plaintiffs against broad groups of participants in the energy industry. Some of these proceedings involve substantial amounts. The Registrants regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. The Registrants do not expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

for further discussion of the impacts of the TCJA.

The potentially dilutive impact from Series B Preferred Stock applies the if-converted method in calculating diluted earnings per common share. Under this method, diluted earnings per common share is adjusted for the more dilutive effect of the Series B Preferred Stock as a result of either its accumulated dividend for the period in the numerator or the assumed-converted common share equivalent in the denominator. The computation of diluted earnings per common share outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 excludes Series B Stock Dividends of $


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and

34,354,000

and

8,885,000

potentially dilutive shares, respectively, because to include them would be anti-dilutive. However, these shares could be potentially dilutive in the future.

(3)

The potentially dilutive impact from restricted stock awards applies the treasury stock method. Under this method, an increase in the average fair market value of Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive impact from these securities.


(18)

Unaudited Quarterly Information

Summarized quarterly financial data is as follows:

(1)

Quarterly earnings (loss) per common share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the quarter, and the sum of the quarters may not equal annual earnings (loss) per common share.

(2)

Amounts have been recast to reflect discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Reportable Segments

The Registrants’ determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which the Registrants manage sales, allocate resources and assess performance of various products and services to wholesale or retail customers in differing regulatory environments.

As of

December 31, 2019

, reportable segments by Registrant are as follows:

•

CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment consists of electric transmission and distribution services in the Texas Gulf Coast area.

CenterPoint Energy provides some corporate services to Houston Electric and CERC. The costs of services have been charged directly to Houston Electric and CERC using methods that management believes are reasonable. These methods include negotiated usage rates, dedicated asset assignment and proportionate corporate formulas based on operating expenses, assets, gross margin, employees and a composite of assets, gross margin and employees. Houston Electric provides certain services to CERC. These services are billed at actual cost, either directly or as an allocation and include fleet services, shop services, geographic services, surveying and right-of-way services, radio communications, data circuit management and field operations.

Leases

The Registrants adopted ASC 842, Leases, and all related amendments on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected not to recast comparative periods in the year of adoption as permitted by the standard. There was no adjustment to retained earnings as a result of transition. As a result, disclosures for periods prior to adoption will be presented in accordance with accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Registrants also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed them to carry forward the historical lease classification. Additionally, the Registrants elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which allows the carry forward of the accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements. The total ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities upon adoption were

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC, respectively. The Merger was completed on February 1, 2019, and as such the amounts recorded upon adoption are exclusive of Vectren’s leases.


An arrangement is determined to be a lease at inception based on whether the Registrant has the right to control the use of an identified asset. ROU assets represent the Registrants’ right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Registrants’ obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, including payments at commencement that depend on an index or rate. Most leases in which the Registrants are the lessee do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, so an incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, is utilized to determine the present value of lease payments. When a secured borrowing rate is not readily available, unsecured borrowing rates are adjusted for the effects of collateral to determine the incremental borrowing rate. Each Registrant uses the implicit rate for agreements in which it is a lessor. Lease expense and lease income are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases.

The Registrants have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain classes of leases, such as office buildings. For classes of leases in which lease and non-lease components are not combined, consideration is allocated between components based on the stand-alone prices. Sublease income is not significant to the Registrants.

The Registrants’ lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictions or material covenants. There are no material lease transactions with related parties. Agreements in which the Registrants are lessors do not include provisions for the lessee to purchase the assets. Because risk is minimal, the Registrants do not take any significant actions to manage risk associated with the residual value of their leased assets.

The Registrants’ lease agreements are primarily equipment and real property leases, including land and office facility leases. The Registrants’ lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised. Operating lease payments exclude approximately

$


million

of legally-binding undiscounted minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. The Registrants have elected an accounting policy that exempts leases with terms of one year or less from the recognition requirements of ASC 842.

The components of lease cost, included in Operation and maintenance expense on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, are as follows:

The components of lease income were as follows:


Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:

Subsequent Events (CenterPoint Energy)

Proposed Divestiture of Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy)

On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment to PowerTeam Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase Agreement, PowerTeam Services has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of VISCO for approximately

$


million

, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on VISCO’s net working capital at closing, indebtedness, cash and cash equivalents and transaction expenses. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.  The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately

$


million

as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to PowerTeam Services.

The completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and (ii) customary conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Securities Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions, including if the closing of the sale has not occurred on or before June 3, 2020. The sale is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, among other things.

On February18, 2020, CenterPoint Energy received notice from the Federal Trade Commission granting early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with the proposed sale of Infrastructure Services.

Proposed Divestiture of Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)

On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment, to Athena Energy Services. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, Athena Energy Services  has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of CES for approximately

$


million

, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on CES’s net working capital at closing, indebtedness and transaction expenses. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. The sale will be considered an asset sale


for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately

$


million

as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer.

The completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and (ii) the conversion of CES to a Delaware limited liability company, (iii) the distribution of the equity interests in CenterPoint Energy Intrastate Pipelines, LLC held by CES to CERC Corp. or its affiliates and (iv) customary conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Equity Purchase Agreement includes customary termination provisions, including if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or before June 24, 2020.The sale is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, among other things.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls And Procedures

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Registrants carried out separate evaluations, under the supervision and with the participation of each company’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on those evaluations, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2019

to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

On the Merger Date, CenterPoint Energy completed the acquisition of Vectren. CenterPoint Energy evaluated the control environment and implemented CenterPoint Energy’s internal control structure over the acquired operations. With the exception of the implementation of the Vectren acquisition into CenterPoint Energy’s control structure, there has been no change in the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2019

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting.


Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Registrants’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management has designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management’s assessment included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Registrants’ management, including their respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, the Registrants conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Registrants’ evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013), the Registrants’ management has concluded, in each case, that their internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, CenterPoint Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of CenterPoint Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

which is set forth below. This report is not applicable to Houston Electric or CERC as they are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

Amendments to Forms of Award Agreements under Long-Term Incentive Plan

On February 18, 2020, the Compensation Committee (“Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy approved new forms of award agreements under CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP for performance awards and restricted stock unit awards.

Among other things, the newly approved forms of award agreements for officers and director-level employees provide that a “retirement eligible” (age 55 or greater with at least five years of service) participant, who meets the requirements for enhanced retirement as specified under the agreement will fully vest in the award, subject, in the case of performance awards, to the achievement of the relevant performance metrics. The requirements for enhanced retirement for employees who are not officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act include having a sum of age and years of employment equal to 65 or greater, providing at least six months’ written notice of retirement, providing a transition plan, and retiring on or after the January 1 immediately following the grant (for restricted stock units) or the first anniversary of the beginning of the designated performance cycle (for performance awards). For officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the requirements for enhanced retirement include having a sum of age and years of employment equal to 65 or greater, providing a transition plan, providing reasonable advanced written notice of retirement (as determined by the Compensation Committee), and retiring on or after the January 1 immediately following the grant (for restricted stock units) or the first anniversary of the beginning of the designated performance cycle (for performance awards). In addition, for officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, eligibility for enhanced retirement is subject to approval by the Compensation Committee.

The newly approved forms of award agreements also provide for pro-rata vesting upon the “sale of subsidiary,” defined as a change in the ownership of a subsidiary, or a substantial portion of the assets of a subsidiary, of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., if the participant is performing services for the subsidiary at the time and ceases employment with CenterPoint Energy upon and in connection with the sale. Amounts vested upon a sale of subsidiary are paid no later than the 70

th

day after the sale.

The description of the forms of award agreements, as amended, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the forms of performance award and restricted stock unit award agreements, as applicable, which are included as Exhibits 10(q)(2), 10(q)(5) and 10(q)(6) hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

As previously disclosed, on December 9, 2019, Tracy B. Bridge, Executive Vice President and President, Electric Division of CenterPoint Energy, provided notice of his intent to retire from CenterPoint Energy. On February 24, 2020, the Compensation Committee elected to pay Mr. Bridge pursuant to the enhanced retirement provisions under the applicable award agreements under CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP in connection with his retirement from CenterPoint Energy effective as of February 25, 2020, whereby his outstanding awards will fully vest, subject, in the case of performance awards, to the achievement of the relevant performance metrics.

On February 26, 2020, the Compensation Committee approved certain compensation arrangements for Milton Carroll, Executive Chairman of CenterPoint Energy, as a result of his increased responsibilities in connection with the previously disclosed resignation of CenterPoint Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Specifically, his increased responsibilities include facilitating the identification, selection and transition of a new President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy. In addition to his base salary of $820,000, effective as of April 1, 2020, and long-term incentive compensation target of 325% of base salary, Mr. Carroll will receive (i) a fully-vested equity award with a value at grant equal to $1,500,000, to be granted upon the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy, with one-third of the underlying shares to be paid upon the grant date, another one-third to be paid upon the first anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining one-third to be paid on the second anniversary of the grant date; provided, however, if Mr. Carroll earlier separates from CenterPoint Energy such that he is neither an employee nor director, any remaining unpaid shares under the award will be payable upon his separation, and (ii) a $500,000 bonus for services rendered in 2019 in connection with CenterPoint Energy’s strategic initiatives.
