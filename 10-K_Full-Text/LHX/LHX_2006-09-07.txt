Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations around the following four business
segments: (1) Government Communications Systems,
(2) RF Communications, (3) Microwave Communications,
and (4) Broadcast Communications. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, in conjunction with the sale of our tools and test
systems (“TTS”) product line, we changed our segment
reporting structure by eliminating the Network Support segment
as a separate reportable segment. The TTS product line is
reported as a discontinued operation, and the
NetBoss

®

network operations software business, which was part of the
Network Support segment, has been consolidated into the
Microwave Communications segment. Segment information for all
periods presented has been reclassified to reflect such segment
reporting structure. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures in this
Annual Report on
Form

10-K

relate
only to our continuing operations. Financial information with
respect to all of our other activities, including corporate
costs not allocated to the operating segments or discontinued
operations, is reported as part of Headquarters Expense or
Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Each of our business segments, which we also refer to as
“divisions,” has been organized on the basis of
specific communications markets. Each business segment has its
own marketing, engineering, manufacturing and product service
and maintenance organization. We produce most of the products we
sell.

Our total revenue in fiscal 2006 was approximately
$3.5 billion compared to approximately $3.0 billion in
fiscal 2005. Total revenue in the United States increased
approximately 12 percent from fiscal 2005 while
international revenue, which amounted to approximately
21 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2006, increased



approximately 34 percent from fiscal 2005. Our net income
for fiscal 2006 was $237.9 million compared to
$202.2 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of
18 percent.

Description of Business by Segment

Government Communications Systems

Government Communications Systems designs, develops and supports

state-of

-the-art
communications and information networks and equipment; develops
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance solutions; designs
and supports information systems for image and other data
collection, processing, interpretation, storage and retrieval;
and offers engineering, operations and support services. This
segment serves a diversified customer base within the
U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense
(“DoD”), Federal Aviation Administration
(“FAA”), National Reconnaissance Office
(“NRO”), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(“NGA”), Census Bureau, Department of State, National
Security Agency (“NSA”), National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”), Defense
Information Systems Agency (“DISA”) and other
government agencies. Government Communications Systems also
provides services, systems and products for other aerospace and
defense companies, including Lockheed Martin Corporation, The
Boeing Company, Northrop Grumman



Corporation, Space Systems/ Loral and ITT Industries. The
Government Communications Systems segment serves four strategic
program areas:

Department of Defense Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a major supplier of spaceborne and airborne
communications and information processing systems and equipment.
Government Communications Systems provides military satellite
communications, data links, avionics, network communications,
large deployable satellite antenna systems, and flat-panel,
phased-array and single-mission antennas. Government
Communications Systems is a supplier of high-frequency satellite
ground terminals for the DoD, supplying the U.S. Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marines. Government Communications Systems is
providing high-speed networking and satellite communications,
including processors, encryptors and terminals, to assist the
DoD’s ongoing transformation of military communications.
The DoD’s Global Information Grid will provide forces with
access to information when and where they need it via secure,
interoperable and mobile communications networks. A key element
of this information grid is the U.S. Army’s Warfighter
Information Network — Tactical (“WIN-T”),
for which Government Communications Systems is providing secure,
high-speed wireless local area networking and phased array
capabilities for WIN-T’s wireless transmission system.
Government Communications Systems is also providing multiband
satellite communications technology and development to the
U.S. Navy’s Advanced Extremely High Frequency
(“AEHF”) satellite program, supplying four Navy
Multiband Terminal prototypes to support the AEHF program. These
terminals will allow units at sea and onshore to communicate
from anywhere via military and commercial satellites
simultaneously, and will enable secure command and control
capability and enhanced communications, such as tactical data
and imagery, real-time video, battlefield maps, and targeting
information. Government Communications Systems is developing
network-centric communications system architectures and
technologies that will link sensors, platforms, weapons and
soldiers and is also developing open-architecture, directional,
mobile ad hoc networking capabilities. During fiscal 2006,
Government Communications Systems was awarded significant
contracts, including: a three-year, $27 million contract to
develop and integrate a communications system that will link the
U.S. Navy’s Advanced Deployable System undersea
surveillance sensors with host Littoral Combat ships; a contract
with the U.S. Air Force for anti-jam GPS technology for
munitions; a contract to develop an encrypted data link system
for an Air Force missile; and a contract to develop a Solid
State Recording Device for Army helicopters. Ongoing previously
awarded programs also include: a contract to provide tactical
common data links for the U.S. Navy Light Airborne
Multi-purpose System (“LAMPS”) helicopters; a contract
to provide large unfurlable spaceborne antennas for the Mobile
User Objective System, a narrowband tactical satellite
communications system that will enhance the
U.S. Navy’s existing satellite tactical communications
system; a contract with the U.S. Navy for Multi-band
Shipboard Satellite Communications Terminals
(“MSSCT”); contracts for portions of the
communications systems for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
(“GMD”) program (formerly known as National Missile
Defense); follow-on awards for the U.S. Army’s
Multiple Launch Rocket System program, including improved fire
control systems (“IFCS”); a contract for
Multi-function Information Distribution Systems
(“MIDS”) terminals for aircraft such as the
U.S. Navy’s

F/A-18

and the
U.S. Air
Force’s

F-16,

as well as ground-based applications; and contracts for the

F-22

Raptor,

F/A-18E/F

Super
Hornet and

F-35

Joint
Strike Fighter aircraft platforms to provide high-performance,
advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber optic networking and
switching, intra-flight data links, image processing, digital
map software and other electronic components.

National Programs:

Government Communications Systems also
is a provider of communications equipment and systems, and image
and information processing solutions to national intelligence
and security agencies and customers. Government Communications
Systems provides comprehensive solutions for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance. Government Communications
Systems addresses each of the six steps of the intelligence
cycle: tasking, collection, processing, exploitation,
dissemination and analysis of information. Government
Communications Systems provides communications equipment,
advanced imagery products and information processing for
intelligence systems, and develops and supplies

state-of

-the-art
wireless surveillance and tracking equipment for vehicular,
man-portable, airborne, and remote/unattended applications. Such
intelligence and surveillance solutions help improve situational
awareness, data collection accuracy and product analysis by
correlating near real-time mission data and intelligence
reference data for display and analysis by strategic and
tactical planners and decision makers. A significant portion of
this program area involves classified programs. While classified
programs generally are not discussed in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

the
operating results relating to classified programs are included
in our consolidated financial statements, and the business risks
associated with such programs do not differ materially from
those of other U.S. Government programs. During fiscal
2006, Government Communications Systems was awarded a contract
with Space Systems/Loral to design and construct four unfurlable
mesh reflectors for commercial satellites. During fiscal 2005,
Government Communications Systems was awarded a three-year,
potential $77 million Rapidly



Deployable Integrated Command and Control System
(“RADIC”) program by the NSA to develop a
knowledge-management software system for its analysts.
Government Communications Systems is also supplying geospatial
and imagery-derived products for the NGA under the Global
Geospatial Intelligence program, including foundation data
products, three-dimensional visualization, mapping and charting
production services, surveying services and production
management.

Civil Programs:

Government Communications Systems also is
a supplier to civilian agencies of the U.S. Government,
including the FAA and the Census Bureau, supplying these
agencies with custom systems and software designed to collect,
store, retrieve, process, analyze, interpret, display and
distribute information, including meteorological data processing
systems, electronic archival systems, graphic information
systems and telecommunication services systems. Government
Communications Systems provides systems integration to
large-scale, geographically dispersed enterprises. Government
Communications Systems is assisting the FAA in modernizing the
U.S. air traffic control system and infrastructure. For
example, we are the prime contractor on a

15-year,

$2.2 billion contract to integrate and modernize the
FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure (“FTI”).
This program is consolidating telecommunications at more than
4,400 FAA facilities nationwide, while reducing operating costs,
enhancing network security and improving service. During fiscal
2005, we were awarded a further contract by the FAA to add
mission support services to the FTI program, as well as a
follow-on contract for the FAA’s Weather and Advanced Radar
Processing System. The total contract amount for the FTI
program, including options, could reach $3.5 billion
through 2017. Government Communications Systems is also working
with the FAA on other programs, including the Voice Switching
and Control System program, which allows air traffic controllers
to establish critical

air-to

-ground and

ground-to

-ground
communications with pilots as well as other air traffic
controllers.

Government Communications Systems also is a developer of
complex, large-scale databases and information systems and
services. Government Communications Systems is the prime
contractor for the U.S. Census Bureau’s Master Address
File/ Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project (“MTAIP”).
The MTAIP contract was awarded to Harris in 2002 and during
fiscal 2006 the U.S. Census Bureau exercised its option to
extend the contract for four years. Currently anticipated to
provide total revenue of $210 million over an eight-year
period ending in 2010, the MTAIP program will provide a computer
database of all addresses and locations where people live or
work, covering an estimated 115 million residences and
60 million businesses in the U.S. During fiscal 2006,
Government Communications Systems was awarded a five-year,
$600 million contract from the U.S. Census Bureau as
prime contractor for its Field Data Collection Automation
(“FDCA”) Program. Under the FDCA Program, Government
Communications Systems will integrate multiple automated systems
required to obtain data from field census takers during the 2010
census. The automated system will capture information collected
during field interviews. During fiscal 2005, Government
Communications Systems, together with Broadcast Communications,
completed a contract to rebuild the Iraqi Media Network
(“IMN”), which is bringing modern radio, TV broadcast
and newspaper infrastructure and media content to the people of
Iraq.

Technical Services Programs:

Government Communications
Systems also provides technical engineering, operations and
services to the U.S. Government. Such services include
information technology outsourcing, enterprise management,
engineering and systems design. Information technology
outsourcing services include data entry, network administration,
system operations and maintenance and procurement and logistics
support. Enterprise management services include systems
engineering and integration, network design, capacity expansions
and information assurance and security. During fiscal 2005,
Government Communications Systems was selected by the NRO to
provide operations, maintenance and support services for the
agency’s global communications and information systems
(“Patriot”) program which is expected to yield more
cost-effective information technology service management. This
program has a potential value of $1 billion over
10 years. During fiscal 2005, Government Communications
Systems was also awarded a contract with a potential value of
$175 million, over nine years, from the DISA in support of
its Crisis Management System. Under the Mission Communications
Operations and Maintenance (“MCOM”) program,
Government Communications Systems provides operations and
maintenance services to the U.S. Air Force Satellite
Control Network’s communications functions at Schriever
AFB, Colorado, and Onizuka AFS, California. Under the
Operational Space Services and Support (“OSSS”)
program, Government Communications Systems provides operations
and maintenance services to the Air Force Satellite Control
Network remote tracking stations and global positioning
satellite sites worldwide. During the first quarter of fiscal
2005, Harris completed the acquisition of The Orkand Corporation
(“Orkand”), a privately-held provider of technical
services and information technology for U.S. Government
agencies, including the Department of State, Department of
Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of



Health and Human Services, and Department of Energy. The
acquisition of Orkand continues to provide insight into
additional opportunities with these new customers.

Revenue, Backlog and Contracts:

Revenue in fiscal 2006
for the Government Communications Systems segment increased to
$1,813 million from $1,805 million in fiscal 2005 and
$1,506 million in fiscal 2004. Segment operating income
increased 6 percent to $216.5 million from
$203.4 million in fiscal 2005 and $153.4 million in
fiscal 2004. This segment contributed 52 percent of our
total revenue in fiscal 2006, 60 percent in fiscal 2005 and
60 percent in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2006, approximately
33 percent of the revenue for this segment was under
contracts with prime contractors and approximately
67 percent was under direct contracts with customers,
compared to 28 percent of revenue under contracts with
prime contractors and 72 percent of revenue under direct
contracts with customers in fiscal 2005. Some of this
segment’s significant programs in fiscal 2006 included the
FTI program, the Patriot program, the MCOM program, the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter platform and various classified programs.
Other significant programs included the AEHF, F/ A-18E/ F, IFCS,
MTAIP, MIDS, MSSCT and the U.S. Air Force’s family of
Beyond

Line-of

-Sight
(“FAB-T”) program and several classified programs. The
largest program by revenue represented approximately
10 percent of this segment’s revenue for fiscal 2006,
compared to approximately 6 percent for fiscal 2005. The 10
largest programs by revenue represented approximately
33 percent of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2006,
31 percent in fiscal 2005 and approximately 30 percent
in fiscal 2004. This segment currently has a diverse portfolio
of approximately 300 programs, each having a value over
$1 million. Historically, this diversity has provided a
stable backlog and reduced potential risks that come from
reductions in funding or changes in customer priorities. In
fiscal 2006, U.S. Government customers, whether directly or
through prime contractors, accounted for approximately
95 percent of this segment’s total revenue compared to
91 percent in fiscal 2005, with the DoD accounting for
56 percent of this segment’s fiscal 2006 revenue and
the FAA accounting for 13 percent.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$382 million at July 28, 2006, compared with
$410 million at July 29, 2005 and $463 million at
July 30, 2004. Substantially all this funded backlog is
expected to be filled during fiscal 2007, but we can give no
assurance of such fulfillment. Unfunded backlog for this segment
was $4,159 million at July 28, 2006, compared with
$4,019 million at July 29, 2005 and
$3,170 million at July 30, 2004. Additional
information regarding funded and unfunded backlog for this
segment is provided under “Item 1.
Business — Funded and Unfunded Backlog.”

Most of the sales of the Government Communications Systems
segment are made directly or indirectly to the
U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts containing
standard government contract clauses providing for
redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
at the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
based upon performance of the contractor. This segment’s
contracts include both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price
contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for the
reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee.
These contracts fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus
fixed-fee contracts, which provide for the payment of a fixed
fee irrespective of the final cost of performance;
(ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for
increases or decreases in the fee, within specified limits,
based upon actual results compared to contractual targets
relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery
schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which
provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
contractor against pre-established performance criteria. Under
cost-reimbursement contracts, this segment is reimbursed
periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the
fee based on contract progress. Some costs incident to
performing a contract have been made partially or wholly
unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples
are certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs and
certain litigation defense costs.

This segment’s fixed-price contracts are either firm
fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
firm fixed-price contracts, this segment agrees to perform a
specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result,
benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of cost
overruns. Under fixed-price incentive contracts, this segment
shares with the U.S. Government both savings accrued from
contracts performed for less than target costs as well as costs
incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price
(which is higher than the target cost), but carries the entire
burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be
adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified performance
objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and fixed-price
incentive contracts, this segment usually receives either
milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract
price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government
in amounts equaling 75 percent of costs incurred under
U.S. Government contracts. The remaining amounts, including
profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final
acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract.
Fixed-price contracts generally have higher profit margins than
cost-reimbursement contracts. Production contracts are mainly
fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are



generally cost-reimbursement contracts. For fiscal 2006,
52 percent of the revenue of this segment was generated
from cost-reimbursement contracts and 48 percent was
generated from fixed-price contracts compared to 60 percent
and 40 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2005 and
68 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in fiscal
2004. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment,
see “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
Government Contracts,” “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

RF Communications also provides unattended ground sensor
systems. These include remote, battery-operated products that
are designed for surveillance and monitoring of high-value
resources such as troop encampments, airfields, base
installations, supply routes and depots.

The worldwide transformation to modernize tactical
communications to provide secure, interoperable and reliable
communications is driving strong demand and positive results for
this segment. Force modernization efforts, including ground
force restructuring and expansion, have gained increasing
momentum and funding as the DoD seeks to deliver enhanced
command, control and communications to more and smaller
operating units. In fiscal 2006, RF Communications
responded to requirements for its Falcon family of radios from a
broad base of U.S. Government customers. For example, the
U.S. Army’s Modularity program is a major
force-transformation initiative that includes smaller, more
agile and rapidly deployable fighting units. The smaller units
are more independent and require greater capabilities for
communications up and down the command structure, which has
created demand for our Falcon radios. Similar communications
modernization programs are under way by the U.S. Marines,
the Army Reserve and the National Guard. Internationally, RF
Communications’ radios are the standard of NATO and
Partnership for Peace countries. Sales in fiscal 2006 were made
to NATO members, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Romania,
Poland, Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria. Additionally, sales in
fiscal 2006 were made to the following countries: Pakistan,
Iraq, Ethiopia, Chile, Algeria, Georgia, Uganda, Saudi Arabia,
Sweden, Australia, Tajikistan and Yemen.

RF Communications has a key position on the U.K. Ministry of
Defence Bowman Tactical Radio Programme (“Bowman”).
Under the terms of the Bowman contract with General Dynamics
United Kingdom Limited, with a value to RF Communications of
approximately $245 million, this segment is providing more



than 10,000 high-frequency radio units over the course of the
five-year program. Production for Bowman began in fiscal 2003.

Revenue in fiscal 2006 for the RF Communications segment
increased 51 percent over fiscal 2005 to $809 million
from $537 million and was $430 million in fiscal 2004.
Segment operating income increased 68 percent to
$278.9 million in fiscal 2006, compared to
$166.5 million in fiscal 2005 and was $118.9 million
in fiscal 2004. The RF Communications segment contributed
23 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2006,
17 percent in fiscal 2005 and 17 percent in fiscal
2004. In fiscal 2006, approximately 37 percent of the
revenue of this segment were derived outside of the United
States, compared to 45 percent in fiscal 2005 and
47 percent in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2006,
U.S. Government customers, whether directly or through
others, accounted for approximately 72 percent of this
segment’s total revenue, compared to 54 percent in
fiscal 2005 and 56 percent in fiscal 2004.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
serviced directly to customers through its sales organizations
and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
this segment markets and sells its products and services through
regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
See “Item 1. Business — International
Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$703 million at July 28, 2006, compared to
$427 million at July 29, 2005 and $331 million at
July 30, 2004. Approximately 90 percent of this
backlog of unfilled orders is expected to be filled during
fiscal 2007, but we can give no assurance of such fulfillment.

The newest product offering is NetBoss EM, an element manager.
Following the sale of our TTS business during fiscal 2004, the
NetBoss network operations software product line became part of
the Microwave Communications segment and prior periods have been
restated to reflect this change.

Principal customers for Microwave Communications’ products
and services include domestic and international wireless/mobile
service providers, original equipment manufacturers, as well as
private network users such as public safety agencies, utilities,
pipelines, railroads and other industrial enterprises. No single
customer accounted for more than 15 percent of fiscal 2006
revenue for the Microwave Communications segment. During fiscal
2006, Microwave Communications entered into a contract with
Vmobile Nigeria to provide radios for the build-out of its
telecom network that spans more than 5,000 kilometers. As part
of providing both backbone and access microwave solutions for
this complex and expansive network, Microwave Communications is
also providing network architecture and planning. During fiscal
2006, Microwave Communications entered into a contract to supply
radios and products to the Commonwealth of Kentucky to assist in
the conversion of the Kentucky Early Warning System from analog
to digital, utilizing TRuepoint radios that will be used to
provide first-responders with critical voice and video services.
Approximately 57 percent of the revenue of this segment was
derived outside of the United States in fiscal 2006, compared to
46 percent in fiscal 2005 and 52 percent in fiscal
2004. In general, this segment’s North American products
and services are sold directly to customers through its sales
organizations and through established distribution channels.
Internationally, this segment markets and sells its products and
services through regional sales offices and established
distribution channels. See “Item 1.
Business — International Business.”

Revenue in fiscal 2006 for the Microwave Communications segment
increased 9 percent from $320 million in fiscal 2005
to $349 million in fiscal 2006 and was $330 million in
fiscal 2004. This segment had an operating loss of
$19.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to operating income
of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005 and an operating loss of
$12.1 million in fiscal 2004. The Microwave Communications
segment contributed 10 percent of our total revenue in
fiscal 2006, 11 percent in fiscal 2005 and 13 percent
in fiscal 2004.

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$164 million at July 28, 2006, compared with
$94 million at July 29, 2005 and $81 million at
July 30, 2004. Substantially all of this backlog is
expected to be filled during fiscal 2007, but we can give no
assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of certain risks
affecting this segment, see “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Broadcast Communications

Broadcast Communications’ hardware and software solutions
support the entire content creation, management, distribution,
and delivery process for broadcast, cable, satellite, and other
media content providers. This segment serves the global digital
and analog markets, providing enterprise software and studio,
video distribution and digital media products, network
management, and transmission equipment and systems.

The current trend and future of broadcast media involves
digitizing content and transporting it simultaneously over many
different networks to many types of devices. This transition
from analog to digital technology enables content owners and
service providers to consolidate and automate their operations.
As a result, this need to create, manage, and ultimately deliver
digital media content is driving an infrastructure upgrade cycle
for the media industry.

Television:

Broadcast Communications develops,
manufactures, and supplies digital and analog television
transmission equipment for

over-the

-air
broadcasters and for the emerging mobile television market. In
addition to high definition picture clarity, digital technology
gives broadcasters the opportunity to expand channel and service
offerings. In response to the U.S. Government-mandated
transition from analog to digital transmission, Broadcast
Communications provided the nation’s first advanced digital
television transmitter, as well as the first commercial digital
television application and is a leader with respect to the
U.S. digital standard known as “ATSC.”
Innovations have included the development of a line of analog
transmitters that can be upgraded for digital operation in the
field. Additionally, in fiscal 2005, Broadcast Communications
introduced
PowerCD

tm

,
a new family of high-power UHF ATSC transmitters designed to
deliver maximum in-band RF power per watt of electricity, and
Broadcast Communications continues to develop next-generation
transmission equipment to provide broadcasters with a smooth
path from analog to digital broadcasting. Broadcast
Communications is also a provider of European-standard digital
“DVB-T” transmission equipment supported by a
technology development center in Austria that focuses on
European-standard DVB-T transmissions systems. Broadcast



Communications is also expanding efforts to reach the emerging
mobile television market under the concept of transmitting
real-time television to personal devices such as cell phones,
PDAs or other mobile devices. Mobile video is in its early stage
of growth, with only a limited number of content providers.
Broadcast Communications is developing and providing
transmission equipment for various mobile video broadcasting
trials in Australia, China, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the
U.S.

Radio:

Broadcast Communications develops, manufactures,
and supplies

end-to

-end
products, systems, and services for the radio broadcast market.
Product offerings include digital and analog transmission
equipment, audio and networking consoles, studio products,
monitoring and control solutions, and systems that range from
single-radio studios to consolidated operations and complete
nationwide networks with hundreds of radio sites. Broadcast
Communications is a leader in the transition from analog to
digital radio. Product offerings address the U.S. digital
standard called “IBOC”

(In-Band/

On-Channel),
which is referred to in the market as “HD
Radio

tm

”,
as well as international digital standards including
“DAB” (Digital Audio Broadcasting) and “DRM”
(Digital Radio Mondiale). The rollout of HD Radio in the
U.S. is progressing with approximately 2,500 of 13,500
radio stations committing to implement HD Radio over the next
several years and approximately 800 stations currently on-air.
During fiscal 2005, Broadcast Communications introduced its
second-generation transmission product family called
FLEXSTAR

tm

,
which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so broadcasters
can offer supplemental audio and data capability along with the
main program stream. This enables broadcasters to develop new
revenue-generating opportunities including multiple programs on
the same channel, 5.1 surround sound, on-demand traffic, weather
and sports reports, store-and-play capabilities, and real-time
navigation.

Software Systems:

Broadcast Communications’ software
systems offering, which was significantly expanded with the
fiscal 2005 acquisition of Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc.
(“Encoda”), enables customers to better manage their
digital media workflow through a portfolio of software products
for programming, scheduling, traffic and billing, as well as for
complementary automation and digital asset management solutions.
Initial modules of the next-generation digital content delivery
platform, called H-Class, were launched during fiscal 2005. The
H-Class software system, which began deliveries in fiscal 2006,
is an enterprise platform which can intelligently manage
delivery of rich digital media across multiple networks,
channels, formats, and devices. H-Class provides broadcasters
and other media, entertainment, and content distribution
customers with a means to integrate disparate processes from
creation to consumption into a single, modular system. Our
recent acquisition of OSi expands Broadcast Communications’
capabilities in enterprise-wide software for managing and
scheduling advertising and programming for broadcasters.

Video Distribution and Networking Solutions:

Video
distribution products and solutions offered by Broadcast
Communications assist the movement of broadcasters to a
multi-channel and multi-media environment as such products
enable the movement of rich media, audio and data efficiently
over a variety of networks. During the second quarter of fiscal
2006, we acquired Leitch, a provider of high-performance video
systems for the television broadcast industry, including routers
and distribution equipment, signal processing, signal management
and monitoring, servers and storage area networks, branding
software and post-production editing systems. Broadcast
Communications is a leader in the conversion from analog to
digital video networking equipment. Products include: the
Platinum

tm

large router for mixed video and audio signal routing, the
IconMaster

tm

digital master control system and the
NEXIO

tm

line of video servers. Broadcast Communications further enhanced
its video networking offerings with the acquisition in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of Aastra Digital Video, a
developer of video networking, encoding, decoding and
multiplexing technologies used by television broadcasters,
telecommunications providers and satellite networks. Networking
solutions provided by Broadcast Communications include routing
and distribution, signal processing, and network monitoring and
management tools for multiple markets. In addition to providing
solutions to the traditional broadcast and cable markets,
customers also include the U.S. Government and public
safety organizations for mission-critical, first-response
scenarios. For example, Broadcast Communications, in conjunction
with Government Communications Systems, is providing extensive
networking solutions for the FTI program. Rapidly growing demand
for content over an increasing number of devices is driving a
transition from single, dedicated networks to flexible systems
that automatically deliver content over the most appropriate and
cost-effective network, transporting the right content to the
right person on the right device.

Revenue for the Broadcast Communications segment increased
40 percent from $384 million in fiscal 2005 to
$538 million in fiscal 2006 and was $287 million in
fiscal 2004. Segment operating income was $22.8 million in
fiscal 2006, compared to $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 and
$8.1 million in fiscal 2004. The Broadcast Communications
segment contributed 15 percent of our total revenue in
fiscal 2006, 12 percent in fiscal 2005 and 11 percent
in fiscal 2004. Approximately 41 percent of the revenue of
this segment were derived outside of



the United States in fiscal 2006, compared to 34 percent in
fiscal 2005 and 39 percent in fiscal 2004. Principal
customers for Broadcast Communications’ products and
services include domestic and international television and radio
broadcast networks and content originators. No single customer
accounted for more than 2 percent of fiscal 2006 revenue
for the Broadcast Communications segment. During fiscal 2006,
Broadcast Communications entered into a multi-year agreement
with Cumulus Broadcasting to provide HD Radio transmission
systems to over 250 Cumulus AM and FM stations. Broadcast
Communications also supplied HD Radio transmission products for
Clear Channel Communications and CBS Radio. Customers for
software and networking systems included Tribune Broadcasting,
Turner Broadcasting, British Sky Broadcasting
(“BSkyB”) in the U.K., TV Azteca in Mexico, Norkring
in Norway, SkyPerfect in Japan, Antena 3 in Spain, Swisscom
Broadcasting in Switzerland, BridgeNetworks in Australia and KUB
Telekomunikasi in Malaysia.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
serviced directly to customers through its sales organizations
and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
this segment markets and sells its products and services through
regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
See “Item 1. Business — International
Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$240 million at July 28, 2006, compared with
$210 million at July 29, 2005 and $105 million at
July 30, 2004. Approximately 67 percent of this
backlog is expected to be filled during fiscal 2007, but we can
give no assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of
certain risks affecting this segment, see “Item 3.
Legal Proceedings” and “Item 1A. Risk
Factors.”

International Business

Revenue in fiscal 2006 from products exported from the United
States (including foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad
was $746.5 million (21 percent of our total revenue),
compared with $559.0 million (19 percent of our total
revenue) in fiscal 2005 and $507.5 million (20 percent
of our total revenue) in fiscal 2004. Our international sales
include both direct exports from the United States and sales
from foreign subsidiaries. Most of the international sales are
derived from the Microwave Communications, RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments. Direct export sales are
primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from
foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local
currency of the subsidiary. Exports from the United States,
principally to Europe, Asia, Africa and Canada, totaled
$418.0 million (56 percent of our international
revenue) in fiscal 2006, $326.6 million (58 percent of
our international revenue) in fiscal 2005 and
$308.6 million (61 percent of our international
revenue) in fiscal 2004. Foreign operations represented
9 percent of revenue in fiscal 2006, 8 percent of
revenue in fiscal 2005 and 8 percent of revenue in fiscal
2004. Foreign operations represented 24 percent of
long-lived assets as of June 30, 2006 and 9 percent of
long-lived assets as of July 1, 2005. Financial information
regarding our domestic and international operations is contained
in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Principal international manufacturing facilities are located in
Canada, China and the United Kingdom. International marketing
activities are conducted through subsidiaries which operate in
Canada, Europe, Central and South America and Asia. We have also
established international marketing organizations and several
regional sales offices. Reference is made to Exhibit 21
“Subsidiaries of the Registrant” for further
information regarding our foreign subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
established by the independent representative and may be above
or below our list prices. These independent representatives
generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark
up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the
customer. During fiscal 2006, revenue from indirect sales
channels represented 6 percent of our total revenue and
23 percent of our international revenue, compared to
revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2005 representing
6 percent of our total revenue and 32 percent of our
international revenue.

Fiscal 2006 revenue came from a large number of foreign
countries, of which no single country accounted for
4 percent or more of our total revenue. Some of our exports
are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried
either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance
payments, progress payments or other similar payments received
prior to, or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs
incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally
require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to stay



competitive in international markets, we also enter into
recourse and vendor financing to facilitate sales to certain
customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
the overall business risk for the international business as a
whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
which we are subject in international business is contained in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Nevertheless, in the
opinion of our management, these risks are offset by the
diversification of the international business and the protection
provided by letters of credit and advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
technological advances. Although successful product and systems
development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
financial resources, some of our competitors in each of our
businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness, product
quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service,
ability to meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of
dealers in international areas.

In the Government Communications Systems segment principal
competitors include: Boeing, Computer Sciences, General
Dynamics, ITT Industries,

L-3

Communications,
Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and SAIC.
Consolidation among U.S. defense and aerospace companies
has resulted in a reduction in the number of principal prime
contractors. As a result of this consolidation, we frequently
“partner” or are involved in subcontracting and
teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to
time, competitors on other programs.

In the RF Communications segment principal competitors include:
General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Raytheon, Rohde &
Schwarz, Tadiran and Thales.

In the Microwave Communications segment principal competitors
include: Alcatel, Ericsson, Fujitsu, NEC, Nokia, Siemens and
Stratex Networks, as well as other smaller companies. Several of
our competitors are original equipment manufacturers or systems
integrators through which we sometimes distribute and sell
products and services to end-users. We believe that our network
and systems engineering support and service are key competitive
strengths for this segment.

In the Broadcast Communications segment principal competitors
include: Broadcast Electronics, NEC, Omnibus, Rohde &
Schwarz, Sony, and Thomson/ Grass Valley, as well as other
smaller companies and divisions of large companies. We believe
that our broad product offering and total content delivery
solutions are key competitive strengths for this segment.

Principal Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only customer
accounting for 3 percent or more of our total revenue, were
66 percent of our total revenue in each of fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004. Additional information regarding customers for
each of our segments is provided under “Item 1.
Business — Description of Business by Segment.”
Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from
contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the
U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government, as
well as for default based on performance. Companies engaged in
supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government are
dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
U.S. Government policies resulting from various military,
political and international developments. Long-term government
contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if
appropriations for subsequent performance periods become
unavailable. Under contracts terminable at the convenience of
the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
facility and personnel



security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency
requirements. For further discussion of risks relating to
U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Funded and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
approximately $5,641 million at July 28, 2006,
$5,160 million at July 29, 2005 and
$4,132 million at July 30, 2004. The funded portion of
this backlog was approximately $1,482 million at
July 28, 2006, $1,141 million at July 29, 2005
and $962 million at July 30, 2004. The determination
of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with
respect to customer requirements contracts and development and
production contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for which
funding has been authorized. Unfunded backlog is primarily
unfilled firm and expected follow-on orders that have not yet
met our established funding criteria. Our established funding
criteria require both authorization by the customer as well as
our management’s determination that there is little or no
risk to the authorized funding being rescinded. In fiscal 2007,
we expect to fill approximately 88 percent of our total
funded backlog as of July 28, 2006. However, there can be
no assurance that our funded backlog will become revenue in any
particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery
delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control.
Additional information with regard to the backlog of each of our
segments is provided under “Item 1.
Business — Description of Business by Segment”
and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Research, Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
approximately $814 million in fiscal 2006,
$870 million in fiscal 2005 and $841 million in fiscal
2004.

Company-sponsored research and product development costs, which
included research and development for commercial products and
independent research and development related to government
products and services, were approximately $188 million in
fiscal 2006, $137 million in fiscal 2005 and
$111 million in fiscal 2004. A portion of our independent
research and development costs are allocated among contracts and
programs in process under U.S. Government contractual
arrangements. Company-sponsored research and product development
costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when
incurred. The portion of total research, development and
engineering expenditures not company-sponsored was funded by
U.S. Government and commercial customers and is included in
our revenue. Company-funded research is directed to the
development of new products and to building technological
capability in selected communications and electronic systems
markets. U.S. Government-funded research helps strengthen
and broaden our technical capabilities. Almost all of our
segments maintain their own engineering and new product
development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
advanced-technology departments. As of June 30, 2006, we
employed approximately 6,200 engineers and scientists and are
continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
our business segments available for all other business segments.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property rights,
in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a
large and valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets,
know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and
other intellectual property. We also license intellectual
property to and from third parties. As of June 30, 2006, we
held approximately 892 U.S. patents and 470 foreign
patents, and had approximately 396 U.S. patent
applications pending and 937 foreign patent applications
pending. However, we do not consider our business or any
business segment to be materially dependent upon any single
patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any
group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual
property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing
program and have entered into a number of licenses and
cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income.
Although existing license agreements have generated income in
past years and may do so in the future, there can be no
assurances we will enter into additional income-producing
license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to
protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our
patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other
proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. With
regard to patents relating to our Government Communications
Systems segment, the U.S. Government often has an
irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to
which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to
use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar
arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of
inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous
trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also
considered to be a valuable asset.



Environmental and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations, in common with those of industry
in general, are subject to numerous domestic and international
laws and regulations designed to protect the environment,
particularly with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe
that we have complied with these requirements and that such
compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Based upon
currently available information, we do not expect expenditures
to protect the environment and to comply with current
environmental laws and regulations over the next several years
to have a material impact on our competitive or financial
position, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures
will not exceed current expectations. If future laws and
regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently
anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present
estimates of those expenditures. We have installed waste
treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy
legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and
prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
environmental capital projects in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. A
portion of our environmental expenditures relates to
discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
material in fiscal 2007. These amounts may increase in future
years. Additional information regarding environmental and
regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” and in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
our Broadcast Communications and Microwave Communications
segments, in particular, are subject to domestic and
international requirements requiring

end-of

-life management
and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers.
Such requirements are not applicable to most equipment produced
by our Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments. We believe that we have substantially complied with
such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to
our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend to
comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our
future products.

Radio communications are also subject to governmental
regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments, in particular, is subject
to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference
among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit
interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
we have substantially complied with such rules and regulations
with respect to our existing products, and we intend to comply
with such rules and regulations with respect to our future
products. Reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could
impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
of a particular item or because of local content preference
requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
materials or products.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be
seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
U.S. Government awards, the availability of funding,
product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

As of June 30, 2006, we employed approximately 13,900
people, compared with approximately 12,600 employees at the end
of fiscal 2005. Approximately 12,500 of our employees are
located in the United States. A significant number of employees
in our Government Communications Systems segment possess a
security clearance. We also utilize a number of independent
contractors. None of our employees in the United States is
represented by a labor union. In certain international
subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’
councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that
our relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that
could impact our business and future results in
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In
addition, our business, operating results, cash flows and
financial condition are subject to various risks and
uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary
materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.

We participate in markets that are often subject to
uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to
estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income
and expenditures.

We participate in markets that are subject to uncertain economic
conditions. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level
of growth in some of the markets in which we participate.
Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are
dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the
uncertainty renders estimates of future income and expenditures
even more difficult than usual. As a result, we may make
significant investments and expenditures but never realize the
anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our results
of operations. The future direction of the overall domestic and
global economies also will have a significant impact on our
overall performance.

We depend on the U.S. Government for a significant
portion of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a
shift in U.S. Government funding could have adverse
consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the U.S. Government.
Approximately 66 percent of our net revenue in each of
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was derived from sales to the
U.S. Government. Therefore, any significant disruption or
deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government
could significantly reduce our revenue. Our U.S. Government
programs must compete with programs managed by other government
contractors for a limited number of programs and for uncertain
levels of funding. Our competitors continuously engage in
efforts to expand their business relationships with the
U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
future. The U.S. Government may choose to use other
contractors for its limited number of programs. In addition, the
funding of defense programs also competes with non-defense
spending of the U.S. Government. Budget decisions made by
the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have
long-term consequences for our



business. A shift in U.S. Government spending to other
programs in which we are not involved, or a reduction in
U.S. Government spending generally, could have material
adverse consequences for our business.

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government
contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to
immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The
termination or failure to fund one or more of these contracts
could have an adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
contracts may be planned or authorized in connection with major
procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal
year basis even though a program may continue for several years.
Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress
makes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a
U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which
could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
funds to a program that already has been started could result in
lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment only
for work done and commitments made at the time of termination.
We can give no assurance that one or more of our
U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other
requirements. These requirements, although customary in
U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
debarment are violations of various statutes, including those
related to procurement integrity, export control,
U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the
recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
could have an adverse effect on our reputation and ability to
procure other U.S. Government contracts in the future.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us
to losses in the event of cost overruns.

We have a number of firm, fixed-price contracts. During fiscal
2006 and 2005, approximately 38 percent and
34 percent, respectively, of our total Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments’
revenue was from fixed-price contracts. These contracts allow us
to benefit from cost savings, but they carry the burden of
potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If
our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these
contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose us to
potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can
compel us to complete a project or, in certain circumstances,
pay the entire cost of its replacement by another provider
regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns
that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these
projects involve new technologies and applications and can last
for years, unforeseen events, such as technological
difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials,
problems with other contractors and cost overruns, can result in
the contractual price becoming less favorable or even
unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet
project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
results.



We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
business in foreign countries, including fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
States. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, revenue for products
exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad was
21 percent, 19 percent and 20 percent,
respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
44 percent of our international business in fiscal 2006 was
transacted in local currency environments. Losses resulting from
currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We
expect that international revenue will continue to account for a
significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant
portion of our international revenue is in less-developed
countries. We are subject to risks of doing business
internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using foreign dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

While these factors and the impacts of these factors are
difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations in the future.

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop
new products that achieve market acceptance.

Both our commercial and defense businesses are characterized by
rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards.
Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of
factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our products by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Manufacture and bring cost-effective products to market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
we will need to continue to develop new products, which will
require the investment of significant financial resources in new
product development. The need to make these expenditures could
divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we
cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to
the timely development of new products. Due to the design
complexity of some of our products, we may experience delays in
completing development and introducing new products in the
future. Any delays could result in increased costs of
development or redirect resources from other projects. In
addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our
products will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of
our products to gain market acceptance could significantly
reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot
be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products
that gain market acceptance in advance of our products or that
our competitors will not develop new products that cause our
existing products to become obsolete. If we fail in our new
product development efforts or our products fail to achieve
market acceptance more rapidly than those of our competitors,
our revenue will decline and our business, financial condition
and results of operations will be adversely affected.

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
events, but they may affect adversely the markets in which we
operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
our profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11,
2001, the subsequent

U.S.-led

military
response, current conflicts in the Middle East and the potential
for future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political
events have created economic and political uncertainties that
could have a material adverse effect on our business and the
prices of our securities. These matters have caused uncertainty
in the world’s financial and insurance markets and may
increase significantly the political, economic and social
instability in the



geographic areas in which we operate. These matters also have
caused the premiums charged for our insurance coverages to
increase and may cause some coverages to be unavailable
altogether. While our government businesses have benefited from
homeland defense initiatives and the war on terror, these
developments may affect adversely our business and profitability
and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict
at this time.

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

The inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key
suppliers to timely deliver our components or products, could
cause our products to be produced in an untimely or
unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. In addition,
there are certain parts or components which we source from other
manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from time to
time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which
may impact their ability to supply the materials, components and
subsystems that we require. Any inability to develop alternative
sources of supply on a cost-effective basis could materially
impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to
customers in a timely manner. We can give no assurances that we
will be free from material supply problems or component or
subsystems problems in the future. Also, our subcontractors and
other suppliers may not be able to maintain the quality of the
materials, components and subsystems they supply, which might
result in greater product returns and could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in
the future that we are infringing upon their intellectual
property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our
intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and
we may be found to be infringing or to have infringed those
intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property
infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty
or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain
royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. We also may be subject to significant damages or
injunctions against development and sale of certain of our
products. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary
technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions
and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our
proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully protect and
enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive
position could suffer. Our pending patent and trademark
registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may
challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark
registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a
significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend
significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual
property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and
our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In
addition, competitors may design around our technology or
develop competing technologies.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
matter could have a material adverse affect on our financial
position and results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are
involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert
financial and management resources that would otherwise be used
to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the
results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An
adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a
material adverse affect on our financial condition.



We are subject to customer credit risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term customer
financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been able to
place a portion of our customer financings with third-party
lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this risk, a
portion of these financings is provided directly by us. There
can be higher risks associated with some of these financings,
particularly when provided to

start-up

operations
such as local network providers, to customers in developing
countries or to customers in specific financing-intensive areas
of the telecommunications industry. If customers fail to meet
their obligations, losses could be incurred and such losses
could have an adverse effect on us. Our losses could be much
greater if it becomes more difficult to place or insure against
these risks with third parties.

The fair values of our portfolio of passive investments
are subject to significant price volatility or erosion.

We have investments in securities of privately-held companies,
many of which still can be considered in the

start-up

or
developmental stages. These investments are illiquid and are
inherently risky as the markets for the technologies or products
they have under development are typically in the early stages
and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment
in these companies.

Developing new technologies entails significant risks and
uncertainties.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
associated with these systems and products may be untested or
unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control systems,
homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
insurance coverage could harm our financial condition and
operating results. Moreover, any accident or incident for which
we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect
our reputation among our customers and the public, thereby
making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
insurance in the future.

We have significant operations in Florida that could be
impacted in the event of a hurricane and operations in
California that could be impacted in the event of an
earthquake.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
Government Communications Systems segment are located in
Florida. In addition, our Broadcast Communications and Microwave
Communications segments have locations near major earthquake
fault lines in California. In the event of a major hurricane,
earthquake or other natural disaster we could experience
business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of
life, all of which could materially adversely affect our
business.

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a
number of factors including:

•

The jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax
    returns;

•

Increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including
    write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and
    impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;

•

Changes in available tax credits;

•

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax
    laws; and

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
    tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
adversely impact net income for future periods.



ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
in Melbourne, Florida. As of June 30, 2006, we operated
approximately 122 facilities in the United States, Canada,
Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
6.2 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
space, of which approximately 4.3 million square feet are
owned and approximately 1.9 million square feet are leased.
There are no material encumbrances on any of our facilities. Our
leased facilities are for the most part occupied under leases
for terms ranging from one month to 9 years, a majority of
which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than five-year
intervals at our option. As of June 30, 2006, the locations
and approximate floor space of our principal offices and
facilities in productive use were as follows:



In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
not considered significant. We continuously review our
anticipated requirements for facilities and will, from time to
time, acquire additional facilities, expand existing facilities,
and dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof, as
management deems necessary. For more information about our lease
obligations, see

Note 19: Lease Commitments

in the
Notes. Our facilities and other properties are generally
maintained in good operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal incident of the
nature and kind of businesses in which we are engaged, various
claims or charges are asserted and litigation commenced against
us arising from or related to: product liability; personal
injury; patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual
property; labor and employee disputes; commercial or contractual
disputes; the sale or use of products containing asbestos or
other restricted materials; breach of warranty; or environmental
matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded
accruals for losses related to those matters that we consider to
be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred. While it is
not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed of or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
information, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
June 30, 2006 are reserved against, covered by insurance or
would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. Government Business.

U.S. Government
contractors, such as us, engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government and its various agencies, depend on
Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
policies. U.S. Government contracts typically involve long
lead times for design and development, are subject to
significant changes in contract scheduling and may be
unilaterally modified or cancelled by the U.S. Government.
Often these contracts call for successful design and production
of complex and technologically advanced products or systems. We
may participate in supplying goods and services to the



U.S. Government as either a prime contractor or as a
subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes may arise between
the prime contractor and the U.S. Government and the prime
contractor and its subcontractors and may result in litigation
between the contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
U.S. Government, and specific acquisition regulations that
implement or supplement the FAR, such as the Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulations. As a U.S. Government contractor,
our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis
by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. In addition to these
routine audits, from time to time, we may, either individually
or in conjunction with other U.S. Government contractors,
be the subject of audits and investigations by other agencies of
the U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are
conducted to determine if our performance and administration of
our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable
contractual requirements and procurement and other applicable
Federal statutes and regulations. These investigations may be
conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict the
outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
against us, our officers or employees. Under present
U.S. Government procurement regulations, if indicted or
adjudged in violation of procurement or other Federal civil
laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating
divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines, penalties,
repayments, or compensatory or treble damages.
U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain
findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
debarment from eligibility for awards of new
U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. In
addition, a U.S. Government contractor’s export
privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension or
debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of
our reliance on U.S. Government contracts.

International.

As an international company, we are, from
time to time, the subject of investigations relating to our
international operations, including under the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous Federal, state
and foreign environmental laws and regulatory requirements and
are involved from time to time in investigations or litigation
of various potential environmental issues concerning activities
at our facilities or former facilities or remediation as a
result of past activities. From time to time, we receive notices
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent
state or foreign environmental agencies that we are a
potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly
known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent laws.
Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup costs at
various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites we
previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by
us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us
from past operations. We own, previously owned or have been
named as a potentially responsible party at 16 such sites,
excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement
or as to which our liability has been finally determined. While
it is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these
proceedings, in the opinion of our management, any payments we
may be required to make as a result of such claims in existence
at June 30, 2006 will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition or our business taken as a whole.
Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
forth in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in
the Notes, which Note is incorporated herein by reference.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
    STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
    SECURITIES.

Market Information and Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and
primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS.”
According to the records of our transfer agent, as of
August 18, 2006, there were approximately 7,124 holders of
record of our common stock. On February 25, 2005 our Board
of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common
stock. The stock split was effected in the form of a
100 percent stock dividend distributed on March 30,
2005 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2005. All share
and per share amounts and information presented in this Annual
Report on
Form

10-K

have
been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock
split for all periods presented. The high and low sales prices
of our common stock as reported on the NYSE composite
transactions reporting system and the dividends paid on our
common stock for each quarterly period in our last two fiscal
years are reported below:



On August 18, 2006, the last sale price of our common stock
as reported in the NYSE composite transactions reporting system
was $45.45 per share.

Dividends

The dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in our
last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
August 26, 2006, our Board of Directors increased our
annual dividend rate from $0.32 per share to $0.44 per
share and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share,
which will be paid on September 15, 2006 to holders of
record on September 6, 2006. Our annual common stock
dividend rate, on a post-stock split basis, was $0.32, $0.24,
and $0.20 per share in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in
March, June, September and December. We have paid cash dividends
every year since 1941, and we currently expect that cash
dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we
can give no assurance. The declaration of dividends and the
amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our
financial condition, capital requirements, results of
operations, future business prospects and other factors that our
Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Sales of Unregistered Securities

During fiscal 2006, we did not issue or sell any unregistered
securities.

Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities

During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 1,050,000 shares of our
common stock at an average price per share of $42.71. During
fiscal 2005, we repurchased 1,874,000 shares of our common
stock at an average price per share of $30.10. We currently
expect that we will repurchase shares of our common stock to
offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock
incentive plans. However, the level of repurchases also depends
on a number of factors, including our financial condition,
capital requirements, results of operations, future business
prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem
relevant. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.

The following table sets forth information with respect to
repurchases by us of our common stock during the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2006:

*

Periods represent our fiscal months.

(1)

On April 27, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved a share repurchase program that authorizes us to
    repurchase, on a post-stock split basis, up to 6 million
    shares of our common stock through open-market transactions, or
    in negotiated block transactions. This program does not have an
    expiration date. The maximum number of shares that may yet be
    purchased under our currently authorized repurchase program as
    of June 30, 2006 is 3,516,000. All repurchases made in the
    quarter ended June 30, 2006 under this program were made in
    open-market transactions. As a matter of policy, we do not
    repurchase shares during the period beginning on the
    15th day of the third month of a fiscal quarter and ending
    two days following the public release of earnings and financial
    results for such fiscal quarter.

(2)

Represents a combination of (a) shares of our common stock
    delivered to us in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax
    withholding obligation by holders of employee stock options who
    exercised stock options, (b) shares of our common stock
    delivered to us in satisfaction of the tax withholding
    obligation of holders of performance shares or restricted shares
    which vested during the quarter,



(c) performance or
    restricted shares returned to us upon retirement or termination
    of employment or (d) shares of our common stock purchased
    by the trustee of the Harris Corporation Master Rabbi Trust to
    fund obligations under our deferred compensation plans. Our
    equity incentive plans provide that the value of shares
    delivered to us to pay the exercise price of options or withheld
    to cover tax obligations shall be the closing price of our
    common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs.

See

Note 15: Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

in the Notes for a general description of our stock and
equity incentive plans.

BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
technology company focused on providing assured communications
products, systems and services for government and commercial
customers. Our four segments serve markets for government
communications, secure tactical radios, microwave communications
and broadcast communications. Our company generates revenue,
income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing and selling
communications products and software as well as providing
related services. We generally sell products and services
directly to our customers, the largest of which is the
U.S. Government and its prime contractors;



however, we utilize agents and distributors to sell some
products and services, especially in international markets.

We operate in four business segments: (1) Government
Communications Systems, (2) RF Communications,
(3) Microwave Communications, and (4) Broadcast
Communications. Financial information with respect to all of our
other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
part of Headquarters Expense or Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
Corporation will be the

best-in

-class global
provider of mission-critical assured communications systems and
services to both government and commercial customers, combining
advanced technology and application knowledge to offer a
superior value proposition.”

Value Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for
Achieving Value

We are committed to our mission statement, and we believe that
executing our mission statement creates value. Consistent with
this commitment to effective execution, we currently focus on
these key value drivers:

•

Continue profitable revenue growth in all segments;

•

Ongoing attention to operating efficiencies and cost reductions;

•

Leverage corporate initiatives across business segments;

•

Use strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolio and gain access to new markets;
    and

•

Maintain an efficient capital structure.

Continuing
profitable revenue growth in all segments:

We plan to
focus on continued profitable growth by implementing the
following strategies in each segment:

Government Communications Systems:

Build on successes in
core markets such as avionics, data links, antennas,
space-hardened electronics, communications networks, database
and image processing, wireless products, and mission services;
and continue emphasis on customer and program diversification to
balance portfolio risk by leveraging capabilities into new
Federal agencies with communications and information technology
needs.

RF Communications:

Leverage reputation and position as a
leading provider of tactical radios in the areas of
high-frequency (“HF”), multiband and cryptographic
sub-systems; and expand market reach with the new
Falcon

®

III
product family.

Microwave Communications:

Capitalize on our strength in
the North American market by continuing to win opportunities
with public telecommunications providers as well as Federal,
state and other private network operators to meet increasing
demand for capacity requirements and the demand for
high-reliability, high-bandwidth networks that are more secure
and better protected against natural and man-made disasters;
increase our international revenue by offering new products and
expanding regional sales channels to penetrate major regional
mobile telecom operators; and continue to offer engineering and
other professional services for network planning, systems
architecture design and project management as a global
competitive advantage.

Broadcast Communications:

Offer the global media market a
broad portfolio of hardware and software solutions to support
every segment of the supply chain that brings digital audio,
video and data to consumers; and continue to fund a robust
offering of new products including video distribution and
digital media products, HD
Radio

tm

and other transmission equipment and software solutions.

Focusing on operating efficiencies and cost
reductions:

Our principal focus areas for operating
efficiencies and cost management are: reducing procurement costs
through an emphasis on coordinated supply chain management;
reducing product costs through dedicated engineering resources
focused on product design; improving manufacturing efficiencies
across all segments; and optimizing facility utilization.

Leveraging corporate initiatives across business
segments:

One of our strengths is our ability to
transfer technology among segments and focus our research and
development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole.
Another area of focus is cross-selling through division sales
channels and joint pursuits by multiple divisions. Other
corporate initiatives include joint international market channel
development, such as shared distributors and coordinated

“go-to

-market”
strategies.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another key value
driver is effective capital allocation by following
macro-economic market and technology trends and by making
effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
the strengths in our base businesses. We believe acquisitions
may also serve to balance and enhance



our portfolio of businesses. Recently we have made several
acquisitions in our Broadcast Communications segment including
Encoda, Leitch, OSi and Aastra Digital Video. These acquisitions
helped us expand our product and service portfolio so we can
offer

end-to

-end
content delivery, transport and asset management solutions to
our customers.

Maintaining an efficient capital structure:

Our
capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital.
We believe our strong capital position, access to key financial
markets, ability to raise funds at a low effective cost and
overall low cost of borrowing provide a competitive advantage.
We had $293.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of June 30, 2006 and had
$334.2 million of cash flows provided by operating
activities during fiscal 2006. Our cash is not restricted and
can be used to invest in capital expenditures, make strategic
acquisitions, repurchase our common stock or pay dividends to
our shareholders.

Fiscal 2006 Key Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
key indicators such as: (1) net income and net income per
diluted share; (2) revenue; (3) gross profit margin;
(4) net income as a percentage of revenue;
(5) operating cash flows; (6) return on average
assets; and (7) return on average equity. The measure of
our success is reflected in our results of operations and
liquidity and capital resources key indicators:

Results of Operations Key Indicators:

Net income,
net income per diluted share, revenue, gross margin, and net
income as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of
our value drivers:

•

Net income increased 17.7 percent from $202.2 million
    in fiscal 2005 to $237.9 million in fiscal 2006;

•

Net income per diluted share increased 17.1 percent from
    $1.46 in fiscal 2005 to $1.71 in fiscal 2006;

•

Revenue increased 15.8 percent from $3.0 billion in
    fiscal 2005 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2006;

•

Gross margin (revenue from product sales and services less cost
    of product sales and services) increased from 27.5 percent
    of revenue in fiscal 2005 to 31.7 percent of revenue in
    fiscal 2006; and

•

Net income as a percentage of revenue increased from
    6.7 percent in fiscal 2005 to 6.8 percent in fiscal
    2006.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below
for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating activities, return on average
assets and return on average equity represent key measurements
of our value drivers.

•

In fiscal 2006, our net cash provided by operating activities
    decreased slightly from $338.8 million in fiscal 2005 to
    $334.2 million in fiscal 2006.

•

We expect to generate more than $400 million of net cash
    from operating activities in fiscal 2007.

•

Return on average assets (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of total assets at the beginning and ending of
    the fiscal year) decreased from 8.6 percent in fiscal 2005
    to 8.5 percent in fiscal 2006.

•

Return on average equity (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of shareholders’ equity at the beginning
    and ending of the fiscal year) increased from 14.9 percent
    in fiscal 2005 to 15.3 percent in fiscal 2006.

Refer to MD&A heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and
Financial Strategies” below for more information.

Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Government and Defense Industry:

The 2006
Quadrennial Defense Review (“QDR”), a Congressionally
mandated review of U.S. military defense strategy,
continued and accelerated the DoD’s prior commitment to a
transformation of the military to focus more on the needs of its
combat commanders and to develop portfolios of joint
capabilities. As a result, the U.S. Government remains
committed to funding intelligence, information superiority,
special operations and support. Requirements to upgrade and
modernize communications capabilities and provide more secure,
interoperable and reliable communications remain a funding
priority. Another funding priority is the security of the U.S.,
which includes better communications interplay between law
enforcement, civil government agencies, intelligence agencies
and our military services. Funding for investments in secure
tactical communications, information technology, information
processing and additional communications assets and upgrades
remains solid. Another priority of the U.S. Government is
investments in productivity, cost reductions and outsourcing. As
a result, programs that promote these initiatives are also
expected to receive



funding. International defense forces continue to drive toward
communications upgrades and interoperability with the systems
and equipment used by the U.S. Government.

Below is a table that outlines the national defense budget
estimates for U.S. Government fiscal year (“GFY”) 2007
to GFY 2011 from the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense

The $439.3 billion DoD GFY 2007 budget request is
approximately 7 percent above the DoD-enacted GFY 2006
budget of $410.8 billion, excluding supplemental
appropriations. While the DoD’s budget increase can be a
positive indicator of growth for the defense industry, we
believe that the level of growth and amount of budget ultimately
allocated to the DoD procurement (“Procurement”),
along with research, development, test and evaluation
(“RDT&E”) components of the DoD budget, are a
better indicator of DoD spending. These accounts are applicable
to defense contractors because they generally represent the
amounts that are expended for military hardware and technology.
We also believe that the federal budget deficit is putting
pressure on spending in all agencies and the number of large new
program starts has slowed.

While there is no assurance that the requested DoD budget
increases will continue to be approved by Congress, the current
outlook is one of increased DoD spending, which we believe will
continue to positively affect our future orders, sales, income
and cash flows. Conversely, a decline in the DoD budget would
generally have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income
and cash flows of defense contractors, including us, depending
on the weapons platforms and programs affected by such budget
reductions. In addition, increased emphasis on
U.S. homeland security may increase demand for our
capabilities in areas such as security systems, information
security, crisis management, preparedness and prevention
services, and civilian security operations.

Government markets other than the U.S. Department of
Defense:

We provide products and services to a number of
U.S. Government agencies other than the DoD, including FAA,
NRO, NGA, Census Bureau, Department of State, NSA, NOAA, and
others. Although our lines of business addressing civil
government needs are not dependent on defense budgets, they
share many of the same risks as our defense businesses, as well
as other risks unique to the particular programs. Recent trends
continue to indicate an increase in demand by Federal and civil
government agencies for upgrading and investing in new
information technology systems and solutions.

We are subject to U.S. Government oversight. Therefore, the
U.S. Government may investigate our business practices and
audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations.
Depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the
U.S. Government could make claims against us. Under
U.S. Government procurement regulations and practices, an
indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result
in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able
to bid on, or being awarded, new U.S. Government contracts
for a period of time. Similar government oversight exists in
most other countries where we conduct business. We are currently
not aware of any compliance audits or investigations that could
result in a significant impact to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

While recent developments in the government and defense industry
have had a positive impact on our Government Communications
Systems and RF Communications segments, we remain subject to
other risks associated with U.S. Government business,
including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual
appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and
other risks, which are discussed under “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” and under “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications
Industry:

Global economic growth rates continue at
modest, but stable levels in the microwave and broadcast
communications industries.



Global trends and developments in the microwave communications
markets include:

•

Continuing build-out of new networks in emerging markets to meet
    rapid subscriber growth;

•

Increasing demand for microwave communications due to build-outs
    for third-generation (“3G”) services rapidly
    increasing the number of cell sites;

•

Increasing demand to support capacity needs for new triple-play
    services;

•

Continuing fixed-line to mobile-line substitution;

•

Private networks and public telecommunications operators
    building high-reliability, high-bandwidth networks that are more
    secure and better protected against natural and man-made
    disasters;

•

Continuing global mobile operator consolidation; and

•

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) mandated
    a 2 GHz relocation project designed to resolve a public
    safety interference problem. The project includes the relocation
    of 12 federal agencies and a significant amount of microwave
    radio content. The FCC has mandated that most television
    broadcasters, fixed link service users and others who operate
    within the 1990 — 2110 MHz spectrum band replace
    and/or upgrade their 2 GHz transmission facilities by
    September 7, 2007 to operate within the 2025 —
    2110 MHz spectrum band. In exchange, the FCC will
    relinquish spectrum at 700 and 800 MHz and pay them cash.

Global trends and developments in the broadcast communications
markets include:

•

Transitioning from analog to digital media content and
    programming continues to reshape the broadcast markets with
    transitions to new digital technologies driving demand;

•

Continuing consolidation in broadcast communications markets is
    creating large enterprises seeking suppliers with a broad
    portfolio of hardware and software solutions to support every
    segment of the supply chain;

•

The FCC has mandated a digital television roll-out
    (“DTV”). All stations had until July 2006 to comply
    with full-power DTV transmission requirements. Congressional
    legislation requires the return of all analog frequencies from
    the broadcasters by February 17, 2009. The returned analog
    spectrum will be available for auction by the FCC for new
    commercial uses;

•

Domestic radio broadcasters are taking steps to transition from
    analog to digital technology. There are approximately 13,500
    radio stations in the United States and 2,500 of these stations
    have committed to convert to digital technology over the next
    few years; and

•

Strongest communications market growth rates are expected in
    Eastern Europe, Central and South Asia, Africa and the Middle
    East. The worldwide transition to digital technologies is in
    various stages of implementation. Many international markets
    remain primarily analog replacement markets.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
the market trends noted above. While we believe that these
developments generally will have a positive impact on us, we
remain subject to general economic conditions that could
adversely affect our customers. We also remain subject to other
risks associated with these markets, including technological
uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s regulations for the
roll-out of digital television, slow market adoption of digital
radio or any of our new products and other risks which are
discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors
that May Affect Future Results” and “Item 1A.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Our revenue
for fiscal 2006 was $3,474.8 million, an increase of
15.8 percent compared to fiscal 2005. Income from
continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was $237.9 million, an



increase of 17.7 percent compared to fiscal 2005 income
from continuing operations of $202.2 million. Revenue
increased in all four of our business segments and was led by
the increase in our RF Communications segment, which increased
50.5 percent. Our Broadcast Communications segment’s
revenue increase was primarily due to the impact of the Leitch
acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and the Encoda
acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

Operating income in our RF Communications, Government
Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications segments
improved in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Our RF
Communications segment led this improvement with a
67.5 percent increase. Our Microwave Communications segment
had a $19.6 million operating loss in fiscal 2006 that
included the impact of $39.6 million in charges associated
with product discontinuances and a shutdown of manufacturing
activities in Montreal, Canada. Our Broadcast Communications
segment operating income was adversely impacted by a
$25.0 million charge related to cost-reduction actions in
fiscal 2006 and the impact of $11.9 million of charges
related to our Leitch acquisition. Headquarters expense
increased in fiscal 2006 and included the impact of a
$5.4 million charge associated with a decision we received
in our arbitration with Bourdex.

Net interest expense increased due to our September 2005
issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of
5% notes due 2015. We had a non-operating loss of
$1.2 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $6.3 million
in fiscal 2005. Our income taxes as a percentage of income
before taxes increased from 32.2 percent in fiscal 2005 to
37.5 percent in fiscal 2006, primarily due to a portion of
the charges mentioned above being recorded in foreign
jurisdictions where we have significant net operating losses and
realization of the associated tax benefits is considered
uncertain. See the “Discussion of Business Segments”
portion below of this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our revenue
for fiscal 2005 was $3,000.6 million, an increase of
19.1 percent compared to fiscal 2004. Revenue increased in
our Government Communications Systems, RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments. Our Government Communications
Systems and Broadcast Communications segments’ revenue
increases included the impact of the Orkand and Encoda
acquisitions, respectively. Income from continuing operations
for fiscal 2005 was $202.2 million, or $1.46 per
diluted share, compared to $125.7 million, or
$0.92 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004.

Operating income from all four of our segments improved in
fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004. Our RF Communications
and Government Communications Systems segments led this
improvement with 40.0 percent and 32.6 percent
increases, respectively. Our Microwave Communications segment
generated operating income of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005
compared to an operating loss of $12.1 million in fiscal
2004. Our Broadcast Communications segment’s operating
income increased to $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared
with $8.1 million in fiscal 2004, and its results for
fiscal 2005 reflect the contribution from the Encoda
acquisition, which included a $4.8 million impairment of
capitalized software and a $3.8 million write-off of
in-process research and development. These improvements in
income were offset by an increase in headquarters expense and
corporate eliminations in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal
2004. In fiscal 2005, we had a non-operating loss of
$6.3 million compared to a non-operating loss of
$11.0 million in fiscal 2004. See the “Discussion of
Business Segments” portion below of this MD&A for

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Our gross
margin (revenue less cost of product sales and services) as a
percentage of revenue was 31.7 percent in fiscal 2006
compared to 27.5 percent in fiscal 2005. Gross margin as a
percent of revenue increased in our Broadcast Communications,
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications segments
and decreased in our Microwave Communications segment. The
fiscal 2006 gross margin was also positively impacted by a
larger mix of sales coming from our higher-margin RF
Communications segment’s products in fiscal 2006 compared
to fiscal 2005. Gross margins decreased



in our Microwave Communications segment due to
$35.0 million of inventory write-downs and other charges
associated with product discontinuances and the shutdown of
manufacturing activities in our Montreal, Canada plant. The
gross margin increase in our Broadcast Communications segment
includes the impact of our Leitch and Encoda acquisitions, which
have higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue than many
of our other operations. The gross margin in our Broadcast
Communications segment was adversely impacted by
$11.3 million of inventory write-downs associated with
previously announced cost reduction actions, including the
transfer of European manufacturing operations to the United
States and outsourcing of other manufacturing activity and
$2.7 million of lower margins being recognized subsequent
to our acquisition of Leitch due to a step up in inventory
recorded as of the acquisition date. See the “Discussion of
Business Segments” discussion below of this MD&A for
further information.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our gross
margin as a percentage of revenue was 27.5 percent in
fiscal 2005 compared to 25.0 percent in fiscal 2004. Gross
margin as a percent of revenue increased across all segments.
The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2005 was significantly
enhanced by additional software sales as a result of our
acquisition of Encoda and margin leverage associated with higher
sales volume in our RF Communications segment. These
improvements in gross margin were partially offset by a
$4.8 million write-off related to the impairment of
capitalized software development costs associated with our
acquisition of Encoda and a larger mix of revenue from our
Government Communications Systems segment, which carries a lower
gross margin than our other three business segments due to the
high level of cost-reimbursable programs it performs for the
U.S. Government. See the “Discussion of Business
Segments” discussion below of this MD&A for further
information.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Our
engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased from

fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses
increased from 16.7 percent in fiscal 2005 to
20.0 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in our
engineering, selling, and administrative expenses in whole
dollars, as well as a percentage of revenue, is primarily
related to increased research and development costs associated
with our RF Communications segment’s
Falcon

®

III
radio development, our acquisitions of Leitch and Encoda,
$13.7 million of charges related to cost-reduction actions
in our Broadcast Communications segment and a $5.4 million
charge in headquarters expense related to our arbitration with
Bourdex. The Leitch and Encoda businesses typically have higher
engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenue than other Harris businesses. See the
“Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below of
this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
administrative expenses, were $187.8 million in fiscal
2006, compared to $137.3 million in fiscal 2005. The
increase was primarily due to increased spending on the
development of our
Falcon

®

III
radio in our RF Communications segment and the acquisitions of
Leitch and Encoda.

Customer-sponsored research and development, which does not
impact engineering, selling and administrative expenses, was
$626.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to
$733.0 million in fiscal 2005. Customer-sponsored research
and development is included in our revenue and cost of product
sales and services.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased from
$421.0 million in fiscal 2004 to $502.6 million in
fiscal 2005. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses were
flat at 16.7 percent. The increase in our engineering,
selling, and administrative expenses is primarily related to our
acquisition of Encoda. This business typically has higher
engineering, selling and administrative expenses than other
Harris businesses. Fiscal 2005 engineering, selling and
administrative expenses include a $3.8 million write-off of
in-process research and development related to our acquisition
of Encoda. Additionally, our Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments had higher research and
development costs in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004.
The rate of increase in our Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments’ revenue, however, outpaced
the rate of increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses. Corporate eliminations and headquarters expense, which
are



included in engineering, selling and administrative expenses,
also increased by $9.2 million and $6.3 million,
respectively. See the “Discussion of Business
Segments” discussion below of this MD&A for further
information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
administrative expenses, were $137.3 million in fiscal
2005, compared to $111.3 million in fiscal 2004. The
increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of
spending on the development of our
Falcon

®

III
radio in our RF Communications segment and an increased level of
independent research and development projects and bids and
proposals in our Government Communications Systems segment.

Customer-sponsored research and development, which does not
impact engineering, selling and administrative expenses, was
$733.0 million in fiscal 2005 compared to
$729.9 million in fiscal 2004. Customer-sponsored research
and development is included in our revenue and cost of product
sales and services.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Our
non-operating loss was $1.2 million for fiscal 2006,
compared to a non-operating loss of $6.3 million for fiscal
2005. The fiscal 2006 decrease in the loss was primarily due to
a $3.7 million loss recognized on the sale of securities in
fiscal 2005. See

Note 21: Non-Operating Income (Loss)

in the Notes for further information.

We have an equity investment in Terion, Inc.
(“Terion”), a privately-held company that provides
wireless data communication and information solutions for mobile
and remote business-to-business applications focusing on the
transportation industry. The maximum exposure to loss we have
with our ownership interest in Terion is $23.0 million.

During July 2006, Terion’s largest customer, representing
approximately 60,000 units of an installed base of approximately
110,000 units, informed Terion that it had signed a contract
with another provider and would be moving its fleet off of
Terion’s system over the next two years. Terion and the
customer are actively negotiating the terms of the wind down of
their relationship after which Terion management will prepare an
updated outlook and forecast. Though we do not currently have
adequate information to calculate the potential impairment to
our investment, we believe that the required write-down of our
investment will be significant. Once the impairment amount is
determined, we will record the impairment under the caption
“Non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income. See

Note 9: Selected Investments

in the Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
non-operating loss was $6.3 million for fiscal 2005,
compared to a non-operating loss of $11.0 million for
fiscal 2004. The decrease in non-operating loss was primarily
due to an $8.5 million gain in fiscal 2005 from our
execution of a patent cross-licensing agreement. See

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
interest income increased from $6.2 million in fiscal 2004
to $7.5 million in fiscal 2005. Higher rates of interest
earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments were partially offset by lower cash and short-term
investment balances as a result of the acquisitions of Encoda
and Orkand. Our interest expense decreased from
$24.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $24.0 million in
fiscal 2005 due to lower short-term debt balances.

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from

32.2 percent in fiscal 2005 to 37.5 percent in fiscal
2006. The increase in the rate is primarily attributable to
charges associated with inventory write-downs in our Microwave
Communications segment, cost-reduction actions in our Broadcast
Communications segment and a charge from our arbitration with
Bourdex being recorded in foreign jurisdictions, where
realization of the associated tax benefits are considered
uncertain because we have significant operating losses in those
jurisdictions. The remaining increase in the rate was mainly
driven by the increase in our earnings and the fixed nature of
tax credits and other benefits we received in both years related
to export sales and a $3.5 million reduction in taxes in
fiscal 2005 from the resolution of certain tax issues, for which
liabilities had previously been established.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from
continuing operations before income taxes was 32.2 percent
in fiscal 2005 and 30.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The
increase in the rate is primarily due to the settlement of a
foreign tax audit in fiscal 2004 that resulted in an income tax
benefit of $3.3 million. The fiscal 2005 rate, however, was
also affected by a $3.5 million reduction in taxes from the
resolution of certain tax issues for which liabilities had
previously been established, as well as a $3.8 million
non-deductible write-off of in-process research and development
related to our Encoda acquisition. The remaining increase in the
rate was mainly driven by the increase in our earnings and the
fixed nature of tax credits and other benefits we received in
both years related to export sales.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Government
Communications Systems segment revenue increased
0.4 percent and operating income increased 6.4 percent
from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The increase in revenue
primarily came from the FTI program for the FAA, the Patriot
technical services program for the NRO, the RADIC program for
the NSA and increased sales of commercial satellite antenna
products, partially offset by spending constraints on our
national intelligence customers. Also, fiscal 2005 benefited
from $79 million in revenue from the IMN program, which was
completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Significant
programs in fiscal 2006 included FTI, Patriot, MCOM, F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter, OSSS, State 6 program for the
U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs to
modernize their information technology architecture, FAB-T,
F/A-18E/F, MTAIP and various classified programs.



Total funded and unfunded backlog was approximately
$4.572 billion and $4.401 billion at June 30,
2006 and July 1, 2005, respectively. These amounts included
both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has
been authorized) and unfunded backlog (primarily unfilled firm
and expected follow-on orders that have not yet met our
established funding criteria). Our established funding criteria
require both authorization by the customer as well as our
management’s determination that there is little or no risk
to the authorized funding being rescinded. Funded backlog was
approximately $400 million at June 30, 2006 compared
to $395 million at July 2, 2005.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
improved during fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005,
primarily due to strong program execution and a higher mix of
fixed-price production programs and favorable program closeouts,
which was partially offset by investments made for programs such
as FTI and Patriot that are in their early phases. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses in this segment increased in
fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 due to increased
investment in supply chain-related initiatives and the impact of
expensing stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards, No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
(“Statement 123R”).

The following major contract awards and highlights occurred
during fiscal 2006 in our Government Communications Systems
segment:

•

$600 million, five-year contract with the U.S. Census
    Bureau for its Field Data Collection Automation program. We will
    integrate multiple automated systems required to obtain data
    from field census-takers during the 2010 Census.

•

$27 million, three-year program to develop and integrate a
    communications system that will link the U.S. Navy’s
    Advanced Deployable System undersea surveillance sensors with
    host Littoral Combat Ships.

•

$10 million design contract on the U.S. Army WIN-T
    program for the low-rate initial production phase.

•

$10 million, two-year development contract from Lockheed
    Martin to provide the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile
    Extended Range weapon data link transceiver that allows weapons
    to be re-tasked while in flight.

•

$8 million initial design and development contract to
    provide ground terminals for NOAA’s Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellite R weather satellite program.

•

A contract with Space Systems/ Loral to design and construct
    four unfurlable mesh reflectors for commercial satellites.

•

Several classified programs.

During fiscal 2006 this segment derived 95 percent of its
revenue from the U.S. Government including 56 percent
from the DoD and 13 percent from the FAA.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Government
Communications Systems segment revenue increased
19.9 percent and operating income increased
32.6 percent from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Revenue
growth was attributable to both the acquisition of Orkand and
organic revenue growth, which was driven by the FTI program, the
Patriot technical services program for the NRO, and the IMN
program. Other programs contributing to revenue growth included
the AEHF, F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, MIDS, the U.S. Army’s
Aerial Common Sensor program (“ACS”) and MTAIP program.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
improved during fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 due to
the revenue growth discussed above and excellent program
execution. Government Communications Systems operating income
also benefited from the final settlement of fiscal 2001 and an
anticipated settlement of fiscal 2002 government overhead rates,
which totaled $10.7 million. This benefit resulted from a
more favorable outcome than what we previously estimated and
reflected in our reserve position. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased in our Government
Communications Systems segment in fiscal 2005 when compared to
fiscal 2004 due to additional research and development, the
acquisition of Orkand and headcount increases in administrative
positions needed to support this segment’s growth in
revenue. The rate of increase in revenue, however, exceeded the
rate of increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses.

The following highlights occurred during fiscal 2005 in our
Government Communications Systems segment:

•

We acquired Orkand, a privately-held provider of technical
    services and information technology for U.S. Government
    agencies, including the Department of State, Department of
    Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Health and
    Human Services, Department of Energy and the U.S. Postal
    Service. For further information related to the acquisition of
    Orkand, including the allocation of the purchase



price and pro forma results as if Orkand had been acquired as of
    the beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 4:
    Business Combinations

in the Notes.

•

We were selected by the NRO for a potential $1 billion,

10-year

contract
    (Patriot program) to provide operations, maintenance and support
    services for the agency’s global communications and
    information systems.

•

We were awarded contracts on two next-generation aerial
    surveillance platforms — the Battle Management Command
    and Control portion for the U.S. Air Force

E-10A

aircraft and the
    U.S. Army’s ACS aircraft. As part of the ACS program,
    we were awarded a $75 million, three-year communications
    integration contract.

•

We were awarded a $275 million contract by the FAA to add
    mission support services to the FTI program scope.

•

We were awarded a contract with a potential value of
    $175 million over nine years from DISA in support of its
    Crisis Management System.

•

We were awarded a contract with a potential value of
    $350 million over 10 years with the U.S. Navy to
    provide tactical common data links for

helicopter-to

-ship
    communications.

•

We were awarded several major classified programs.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

RF
Communications segment revenue increased 50.5 percent and
operating income increased 67.5 percent from fiscal 2005 to
fiscal 2006. Strong revenue growth came from both U.S. and
international markets and was primarily driven by force
modernization, force restructuring initiatives moving
communications closer to individual soldiers, and the worldwide
need for interoperable communications. This demand led to
increased sales of our
Falcon

®

II
family of products and the successful introduction of our new
Falcon

®

III
product family.

The operating income improvement in our RF Communications
segment was driven primarily by improved gross margin on higher
sales volume as manufacturing efficiencies were realized.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
our RF Communications segment during fiscal 2006 when compared
to fiscal 2005 due to additional research and development costs
associated with the development of our
Falcon

®

III
product family and expenses needed to market and sell new
products. To continue to meet strong demand across all product
lines in this segment, we significantly expanded our radio
manufacturing capacity.

Orders for fiscal 2006 were above $1.0 billion for this
segment. Significant orders secured during fiscal 2006 included:

•

A $169 million contract and a $38 million contract
    from the U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command
    to deliver
    Falcon

®

III

AN/VRC-110

vehicular radio systems.

•

Several contracts totaling over $250 million from the
    U.S. Marine Corps to deliver
    Falcon

®

II
    AN/PRC-117F(C) multiband tactical radios and AN/PRC-150(C) high
    frequency radios.

•

Several contracts totaling over $350 million from the
    U.S. Army to deliver
    Falcon

®

II
    AN/PRC-117F(C) multiband tactical radios and AN/PRC-150(C) high
    frequency radios.

•

Significant orders to provide tactical radios to customers in
    the United Kingdom, Algeria, Mexico, Chile, Iraq, Canada, NATO
    headquarters, Romania, Uganda, Poland, Spain, Pakistan, Saudi
    Arabia and Estonia.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

RF
Communications segment revenue increased 24.8 percent and
operating income increased 40.0 percent from fiscal 2004 to
fiscal 2005. Domestic revenue drivers included deliveries for
both multiband and HF
Falcon

®

II
radios to support the U.S. Army Modularity initiative, Army
Reserve, National Guard and Marine Corps. International revenue
benefited from the continuing ramp up of the Bowman Tactical
Radio Programme for the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the initial
deliveries of
Falcon

®

II
radios



to Pakistan under a $68 million contract awarded in fiscal
2005 and other deliveries within the international market.

The operating income improvement in our RF Communications
segment was driven by improved gross margin on higher sales
volume and cost savings from successful negotiations with
contract manufacturers on the U.K. Bowman Tactical Radio
Programme. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our RF Communications segment during fiscal
2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 due to additional research and
development costs associated with the development of our
Falcon

®

III
products and expenses needed to sustain the growth in this
segment’s revenue. The rate of increase in revenue,
however, exceeded the rate of increase in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses.

Orders during the year were significantly greater than sales.
Tactical radio demand from DoD customers continued to be strong
during fiscal 2005. Force modernization efforts gained increased
momentum and funding. This initiative delivers enhanced command,
control and communications to more and smaller operating units.
Significant domestic orders secured during fiscal 2005 included:

•

Two contracts awarded from the U.S. Army to provide our
    Falcon

®

II
    HF and multiband radios and related services for operations in
    Iraq and Afghanistan and for the U.S. Army’s
    Modularity program. Each contract was worth approximately
    $30 million.

•

An Indefinite-Delivery/ Indefinite-Quantity contract awarded
    from the U.S. Marine Corps for HF radios valued at up to
    $75 million.

•

A $33 million order from the U.S. Army for HF radios,
    which included $16 million in support of Army Modularity.

•

A $50 million order for high-frequency radios and a
    $22 million order for multiband radios to support the
    U.S. Army Modularity Initiative, Army Reserve and National
    Guard.

•

A $55 million contract to a Boeing-led team, which includes
    our RF Communications segment, for the Airborne, Maritime/
    Fixed-Station cluster of the JTRS program for the DoD.

Demand in international markets also remained strong as the need
for communications that are secure, interoperable and reliable
has grown. International orders were received from NATO members
and other countries, including a $68 million order from
Pakistan and large orders from Algeria, the Philippines,
Ethiopia, the Republic of Georgia, Denmark, Estonia, Sweden,
Azerbaijan, and the Netherlands.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Microwave
Communications segment revenue increased 8.9 percent from
fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. This segment had an operating loss
of $19.6 million in fiscal 2006 compared to operating
income of $7.7 million in fiscal 2006. The success of this
segment’s
TRuepoint

tm

radio products and a strengthening market for microwave radios
primarily drove the increase in revenue. International order
rates increased, particularly in Africa. In North America,
microwave demand for both private networks and mobile service
providers continued to be driven by capacity expansion and by
network upgrades to provide high-reliability, high-bandwidth
applications.

The decrease in operating income was primarily due to
$39.6 million of inventory write-downs and severance costs
associated with product discontinuances and the shut-down of our
manufacturing activities in Montreal, Canada. During the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, the Microwave Communications segment
successfully released additional frequencies of the
TRuepoint

tm

product family, essentially completing all current frequencies
intended to be offered in the low- and mid-capacity microwave
radio market segments. In light of these releases, and the
market acceptance of previously released frequencies as
demonstrated by
TRuepoint

tm

product sales, management announced during the second quarter of
fiscal 2006 a manufacturer’s discontinuance
(“MD”) of the MicroStar M/
H

tm

,
MicroStar
L

tm

and
Galaxy

tm

product families (the product families the
TRuepoint

tm

product line was developed to replace) and of the
ClearBurst

tm

product family, a product line that



shares manufacturing facilities with the
MicroStar

tm

and the
Galaxy

tm

product lines in Montreal, Canada. In November 2005, letters
were sent to
MicroStar

tm

,
Galaxy

tm

and
ClearBurst

tm

customers, informing them of the MD announcement.

We estimated expected demand for these products based on:
responses to the letters noted above and a percentage of the
installed base, using previous product MD history as a basis for
this estimate. In addition, the customer service inventory of
these discontinued products was reviewed and quantities required
to support existing warranty obligations and contractual
obligations were quantified. These analyses identified inventory
held in multiple locations including Montreal, Canada; Redwood
Shores, California; San Antonio, Texas; Paris, France;
Mexico City, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Shenzhen, China. As
a result of these analyses, $34.0 million of inventory was
written down in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Also,
$5.6 million of severance and other costs were recorded in
fiscal 2006 related to the shutdown of manufacturing activities
in our Montreal, Canada plant and product discontinuances. The
inventory reserved for in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 has
been subsequently disposed of or scrapped. No additional
material costs or charges are expected to be incurred in
connection with these product discontinuances.

The decrease in gross margins and operating income associated
with the product discontinuances noted above were partially
offset by improved gross margins in fiscal 2006 as a result of
increased shipments of
TRuepoint

tm

,
a family of lower-cost microwave radios, and a shift away from
lower-margin international projects. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2006 when compared
to fiscal 2005 as a result of increased selling expenses and
stock and cash based compensation plan expenses.

Orders in our Microwave Communications segment increased
21 percent from $332 million in fiscal 2005 to
$402 million in fiscal 2006. Significant orders received in
this segment during fiscal 2006 included:

•

$58 million in orders from Vmobile Nigeria as part of a
    contract to provide radios for its transmission and transport
    network spanning more than 5,000 kilometers.

•

A $14 million order from the Commonwealth of Kentucky as
    part of a state-wide, three-year, potential $42 million
    program to transition the Kentucky Early Warning System from
    analog to digital technology using
    TRuepoint

tm

radios.

•

Significant international orders received from customers in
    Nigeria, Canada, Mexico, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Romania, Brazil and
    Zambia.

•

Various other large orders from private network and major mobile
    telecommunications providers in North America.

On September 5, 2006, we announced that we entered into a
definitive agreement with Stratex Networks pursuant to which we
will combine the Microwave Communications segment with Stratex
Networks. For additional information regarding the transaction,
see “Item 1. Business — Subsequent
Event — Agreement with Stratex Networks, Inc.”

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Microwave
Communications segment revenue decreased 2.9 percent from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The segment improved from an
operating loss of $12.1 million in fiscal 2004 to operating
income of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005. North American sales
remained strong. Strength in international markets came from the
Middle East, Africa, Europe and improved Latin American markets.
The slight decline in revenue was primarily attributable to the
revenue generated in fiscal 2004 from the build out of a large
mobile telecom network for MTN Nigeria, which was only partially
offset by an increase in North American revenue and new
international contracts won during fiscal 2005.

Gross margins in the Microwave Communications segment improved
in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased shipments of
TRuepoint

tm

,
a new family of lower-cost microwave radios, and a shift away
from lower-margin international projects. Engineering, selling
and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal 2005 when
compared to fiscal 2004 due to cost-reduction actions taken
during fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2004 operating loss of
$12.1 million included a charge of $7.3 million
associated with cost-reduction actions related to the successful
transfer of
TRuepoint

tm

production from Montreal, Canada to San Antonio, Texas as
well as the consolidation of administrative and support
functions at this segment’s Durham, North Carolina
location.
TRuepoint

tm

orders and sales accelerated during fiscal 2005.
TRuepoint

tm

orders were significantly greater than sales of $45 million
for fiscal 2005, which exceeded our goal of $30 million in
sales of
TRuepoint

tm

for the year.

Significant orders during the year included an on-going network
project for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a major order
with a large defense contractor in support of an international
communications project, and various private network and mobile
telecommunications providers in North America. In addition to
North America, major new international orders included Vee
Networks Limited in Nigeria, MTN Nigeria,



Nextel Brazil and Mexico, Loteny Telecom in the Ivory Coast,
Umniah Mobile Company in Jordan, and PT Alvarid in Indonesia. We
expanded our customer base in the Middle East and Africa and
received orders from several new channel partners, including
IRTE in Italy and ZTE and Huawei in China, which served to
expand our international presence. During fiscal 2005 we also
signed a long-term preferred supplier agreement with Sprint to
provide
TRuepoint

tm

radios for its nationwide mobile services.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal 2005:

Broadcast
Communications segment revenue increased 40.2 percent and
operating income increased 26.0 percent from fiscal 2005 to
fiscal 2006. Leitch, which was acquired in October 2005, and
Encoda, which was acquired in November 2004, were main
contributors to the increase in segment revenue and operating
income. The increase in revenue was also partly attributable to
increased demand for digital TV, Net VX networking, and HD
Radio

tm

products.

The operating income for this segment was adversely impacted by
a $25.0 million charge related to inventory write-downs,
severance and other costs associated with cost-reduction
actions. The cost-reduction actions were taken to address
ongoing weakness in our international broadcast transmission
markets and to further improve the segment’s profitability.
These actions included closing our Huntingdon, United Kingdom
facility; relocating manufacturing of European-standard
transmission products to our Quincy, Illinois facility; reducing
our infrastructure in Austria; outsourcing manufacturing of
radio consoles and related products from our Mason, Ohio
facility; and headcount reductions from further integration
within our software systems business. Charges incurred in fiscal
2006 related to these actions included $9.7 million of
severance and other employee-related exit costs and
$2.3 million of facility-related exit costs. These actions
resulted in a headcount reduction of 150. The cost-reduction
actions helped to significantly improve operating margins for
this segment in fiscal 2006.

Research and development costs in this segment were higher
because we continued to invest in new product development such
as our
H-Class

tm

broadcast enterprise software systems solution,
FlexStar

®

HD
Radio

tm

transmission products, next-generation video distribution and
media products and transmission equipment for use in mobile
video broadcasting applications.

During fiscal 2006, we made three strategic acquisitions in this
segment. In October 2005, we completed the acquisition of
Leitch, a publicly-held provider of high-performance video
systems for the television broadcast industry. In April 2006, we
completed the acquisition of OSi, a privately-held provider of
air-time sales, traffic and billing software systems to over 350
call-letter broadcast stations in North America. In May 2006, we
completed the acquisition of Aastra Digital Video, a developer
and marketer of video networking products.

Operating income was negatively impacted during fiscal 2006 by
$11.9 million of charges related to our acquisition of
Leitch, including the write-off of in-process research and
development, lower margins being recognized subsequent to our
acquisition due to a

step-up

of inventory
taken at the acquisition date and integration activities. For
further information related to the acquisition of Leitch,
including the allocation of the purchase price and pro forma
results as if Leitch had been acquired as of the beginning of
the periods presented, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the Notes.

Orders in our Broadcast Communications segment increased
66 percent from $308 million in fiscal 2005 to
$511 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily
due to the acquisitions of Leitch and Encoda. Significant orders
received by our Broadcast Communications segment during fiscal
2006 included:

•

TV transmission equipment orders from: Media General and
    Entravision in the U.S.; Swisscomm Broadcasting in Switzerland;
    StarTV in Indonesia; TV Azteca in Mexico; Bridge Networks in
    Australia; and Radiocommunicatii in Romania.

•

Radio transmission equipment orders from: Clear Channel
    Communications and other major broadcasters in the U.S.,
    including a multi-year agreement with Cumulus Broadcasting to
    provide
    HDRadio

®



transmission systems to over 250 Cumulus FM and AM stations;
    Iberica de Componentes in Spain; and Cimax in China.

•

Software systems orders from: Tribune Broadcasting, Media
    General and other global TV networks that are transitioning from
    legacy products to our new

H-Class

tm

software platform in the U.S. as well as orders from
    SkyPerfect in Japan.

•

Networking orders from: the FAA through our FTI program, Sprint
    and the New York/ New Jersey Port Authority in the U.S.;
    Radiocommunicatii in Romania; and Norkring in Norway.

•

Video distribution and digital media products acquired in the
    Leitch acquisition experienced double-digit order growth. Demand
    was particularly strong for the
    X75

tm

processor,
    Platinum

tm

router and
    IconMaster

tm

master control system.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Broadcast
Communications segment revenue increased 33.7 percent from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The segment also had operating
income of $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared to
$8.1 million in fiscal 2004.

Encoda, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2005,
made significant contributions to segment revenue in fiscal
2005. Revenue drivers in fiscal 2005 also included increased
sales in the U.S. of HD
Radio

tm

transmission equipment. The roll out of HD
Radio

tm

continued to gain momentum with 2,500 radio stations committed
to begin their digital broadcasts during the next four years.
U.S. digital television (“DTV”) transmission
equipment sales increased in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal
2004 as broadcasters moved to meet FCC deadlines for full-power
transmission digital signals. This segment also experienced a
growing demand for its Intraplex products on our FTI program
with the FAA to carry high volumes of real-time,
mission-critical data. Revenue growth was dampened, however, by
weakness in international market conditions for both analog and
European-standard digital broadcasting equipment and for legacy
automation systems as we transitioned customers to our new
H-Class

tm

enterprise software system.

Operating income increased from $8.1 million in fiscal 2004
to $18.1 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in operating
income in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily
due to the acquisition of Encoda. Encoda sells software solution
products and services that carry higher gross margins than most
of this segment’s other products and services. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses increased significantly,
which was also primarily due to the Encoda acquisition.
Encoda’s products and services require a higher investment
in research and development than most of our other products in
this segment. Research and development costs in this segment
were also higher because we continued to invest in new product
development. During fiscal 2005, we introduced the first module
in our next-generation
H-Class

tm

broadcast enterprise software systems solutions. We also
introduced the new
PowerCD

tm

UHF digital transmitter that allows broadcasters to transition
quickly to DTV while reducing energy costs. We also developed
transmission equipment for use in mobile video broadcasting
trials in the U.S., U.K., Australia and China, and we continued
to invest in our second-generation
FlexStar

®

HD
Radio

tm

transmission product line.

The fiscal 2005 segment operating income of $18.1 million
also included $8.6 million of acquisition-related costs,
including a $4.8 million impairment of capitalized software
costs related to a software product sold by our Broadcast
Communications segment and being displaced by a product offered
by Encoda and a $3.8 million write-off of in-process
research and development.

The following highlights occurred during fiscal 2005 in our
Broadcast Communications segment:

•

We acquired Encoda, a global supplier of software solutions and
    services for the broadcast media industry, including television,
    radio, cable, satellite and advertising agency customers.
    Encoda’s

end-to

-end workflow
    solutions include traffic and billing and program-scheduling
    systems, and automation and media asset management solutions
    that are complementary to our existing automation business. For
    further information related to the acquisition of Encoda,
    including the allocation of the purchase price and pro forma
    results as if Encoda had been acquired as of the beginning of
    the periods presented, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the Notes.

•

Significant domestic digital TV equipment orders were received
    from: Gray Communications, Entravision Communications, Belo
    Corporation, Quincy Newspapers, Inc., the Tri-State Christian
    Network, and Liberty Corporation as well as international orders
    from TV Azteca in Mexico, and other customers in Australia,
    Bulgaria and China.

•

Numerous HD
    Radio

tm

transmission orders were booked for: National Public Radio, Cox
    Communications and Clear Channel Communications, among others.

•

We also received a large order from BSkyB for our software
    systems products. BSkyB will use the software as part of its
    high-definition television services.



•

We were awarded a contract to provide FM radio transmission
    systems and equipment to the International Broadcasting Bureau.

•

We also received major orders from Turner Broadcasting and Sony
    Corporation for our software systems products.

fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, headquarters expense
increased from 1.9 percent in fiscal 2005 to
2.2 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in headquarters
expense was primarily due to a $5.4 million charge
associated with a decision we received in our arbitration with
Bourdex. The increase in headquarters expense also included the
impact of stock-based compensation expense, consulting fees and
charitable contributions. Corporate eliminations were unchanged
at $16.5 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Headquarters expense increased 12.2 percent from
$51.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $58.0 million in
fiscal 2005. The increase in headquarters expense was primarily
due to higher compensation expense related to stock-based
compensation as a result of the increased price for Harris stock
as well as additional costs associated with the implementation
of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 and initiatives related
to supply chain management, strategic acquisitions and
technology transfers. Corporate eliminations increased
126.0 percent from $7.3 million in fiscal 2004 to
$16.5 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of revenue,
headquarters expense decreased from 2.1 percent in fiscal
2004 to 1.9 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase in
corporate eliminations was due to an increase in intersegment
sales between our Broadcast Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments related to our FTI program.

In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the Leitch and Encoda acquisitions, we
allocated $3.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively,
of the purchase prices to in-process research and development
projects. These allocations represent the estimated fair value
based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete
products. At the date of each acquisition, the development of
these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and
the in-process research and development had no alternative
future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as a
one-time charge to earnings and are included in engineering,
selling and administrative expenses.

In making these purchase price allocations we relied on present
value calculations of income, an analysis of project
accomplishments and completion costs and an assessment of
overall contribution and project risk. The amounts assigned to
the in-process research and development were associated with
research projects for which technological feasibility had not
been established.

The value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
the purchased in-process research and development into
commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value using a discount rate of 25 percent
for both Leitch and Encoda.

The Leitch projects were for the development of their
Platinum

tm

and
IconMaster

tm

products. The
Platinum

tm

product is a mid- to large-size router with audio, monitoring
output, streaming and event-configuration capabilities. The
IconMaster

tm

product is a modular, mid-size master control with branding
capabilities. As of the valuation date, these projects were
estimated to be completed at the end of January 2006 and had
remaining costs until completion of approximately
$1.0 million.

The Encoda project was for the development of a next-generation
product line that encompassed some of the latest research
applicable to media technologies, such as emergence and learning
theory. As of the valuation date, this project was considered to
be approximately 30 to 40 percent complete and had
remaining costs until completion of approximately
$6.2 million.



Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed the sale of
our TTS product line to a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation for
$43.1 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. The gain on the sale that was recorded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $18.9 million pre-tax and
$9.1 million after-tax. This transaction, along with the
results of the TTS product line, has been reported as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented. Revenue from
the TTS product line was $40.3 million in fiscal 2004. The
product line also had a pre-tax operating loss of
$3.5 million in fiscal 2004. Discontinued operations are
more fully discussed in

Note 2: Discontinued Operations

in the Notes.

We changed our segment reporting structure effective
May 28, 2004 in conjunction with the sale of our TTS
product line. The TTS product line was formerly part of the
Network Support segment. As a result of the sale, our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes report the TTS
product line as a discontinued operation, and accordingly, prior
periods have been restated. We also have eliminated the Network
Support segment as a separate reportable segment. The
NetBoss

®

network operations product line, which was also part of the
Network Support segment, was not included in the sale and is
consolidated in the Microwave Communications segment for all
periods presented. The
NetBoss

in the Notes for further
information.

Management currently believes that existing cash, funds
generated from operations, our credit facilities and access to
the public and private debt and equity markets will be
sufficient to provide for our anticipated requirements for
working capital, capital expenditures and stock repurchases
under the current repurchase program for the next 12 months
and the foreseeable future. We expect tax payments over the next
three years to approximate our tax expense during the same
period. We anticipate that our fiscal 2007 cash payments may
include strategic acquisitions. With the exception of potential
acquisitions, no other significant cash payments are anticipated
in fiscal 2007 and thereafter, other than those noted in the
“Contractual Obligations” discussion below of this
MD&A.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
continue to generate cash flow at current levels, or that
anticipated operational improvements will be achieved. If we are
unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash
flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be
required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, terminate
our stock repurchase program, reduce or eliminate dividends,
refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain
additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal
payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness
depends on our future performance and financial results, which,
to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
affecting the government, defense, microwave communications and
broadcast communications markets and to general economic,
political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory
factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities:

Our net
cash provided by operating activities was $334.2 million in
fiscal 2006 compared to $338.8 million in fiscal 2005. All
four of our segments generated positive cash flows



in fiscal 2006 with RF Communications and Microwave
Communications posting significant improvements when compared to
fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 cash flow improvements that resulted
from higher operating income in our RF Communications,
Government Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications
segments and improved capital management in our Microwave
Communications segment were offset by an increase in working
capital needed to support the growth in our RF Communications
segment, a higher mix of fixed-price programs in our Government
Communications Systems segment, income tax refunds collected in
fiscal 2005 and a $13.5 million adverse impact in fiscal
2006 from Statement 123R. We expect cash flow provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2007 to exceed $400 million.

Net cash used in investing activities:

Our net
cash used in investing activities was $768.6 million in
fiscal 2006 compared to $316.7 million in fiscal 2005. Net
cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 was due to
$509.6 million cash paid for business acquisitions,
$112.6 million net purchases of short-term investments,
$101.8 million additions of property, plant and equipment
and $44.6 million additions of capitalized software. Net
cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 was primarily
due to $427.3 million cash paid for business acquisitions,
$75.0 million additions of property, plant and equipment
and $23.8 million additions of capitalized software, which
was partially offset by $196.0 million net proceeds from
the sale of short-term investments and $13.4 million
proceeds from the sale of securities available-for-sale.

The increase in our additions of capitalized software and
property, plant and equipment from $98.8 million in fiscal
2005 to $146.4 million in fiscal 2006 mainly relates to
increased software purchases in our Government Communications
Systems segment, increased manufacturing capacity related to
Falcon

®

II
and
Falcon

®

III
radio production in our RF Communications segment and our Leitch
acquisition. Our total additions of capitalized software and
property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2007 are expected to be
in the $140 million to $150 million range.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities:

Our net cash provided by financing
activities in fiscal 2006 was $236.4 million compared to
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 of
$76.9 million. The net cash provided by financing
activities in fiscal 2006 was primarily from the issuance of
$300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
due October 1, 2015. See

Note 13: Long-Term Debt

in the Notes for more information. The net cash provided by
financing activities in fiscal 2006 also included proceeds from
the exercise of employee stock options of $33.8 million.
The cash provided by financing activities from the issuance of
debt and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options
was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling
$42.7 million and the repurchase of common stock of
$44.9 million. In fiscal 2006, we issued
1,697,526 shares of common stock to employees under the
terms of our option and incentive plans.

The net cash used in financing activities of $76.9 million
in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to repurchases of our common
stock of $56.4 million and $31.9 million of cash
dividends paid. Net payments of borrowings in fiscal 2005 were
$8.4 million. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
options of $19.8 million in fiscal 2005 partially offset
these payments. In fiscal 2005, we issued 2,224,816 shares
of common stock to employees under the terms of our option and
incentive plans.

Common Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2006, we used $44.9 million to
repurchase 1,050,000 shares of our common stock at an
average price per share of $42.71 including commissions. During
fiscal 2005, we used $56.4 million to
repurchase 1,874,000 shares of our common stock at an
average price per share of $30.10 including commissions. We
currently expect that we will repurchase shares of common stock
to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock
incentive plans. Additional information regarding repurchases
made during fiscal 2006 and our repurchase programs is set forth
above under Part II, “Item 5. Market For
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Dividend Policy

On August 26, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.11 per share, for an
annualized rate of $0.44 per share, which was our fifth
consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend
was $0.32, $0.24, and $0.20 per share in fiscal 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively. Additional information concerning our
dividends is set forth above under Part II,
“Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities.”

Capital Structure and Resources

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the



form of revolving loans and letters of credit issuances at any
time and from time to time during the term of the Credit
Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed $500 million (we may request an
increase, not to exceed an additional $250 million). The
Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and other
general corporate purposes and to support any commercial paper
that we may issue. At our election, borrowings under the Credit
Agreement will bear interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable
margin or at the base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate
equal to the higher of the Federal funds rate plus
0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced
prime lending rate. The Credit Agreement provides that the
interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set at
0.50 percent, will increase or decrease within certain
limits based on changes in the ratings of our senior, unsecured
long-term debt securities. We are also permitted to request
borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set
pursuant to competitive bid procedures or directly negotiated
with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
including payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
$50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
under the Credit Agreement are due and mature on March 31,
2010, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at
our request or if certain events of default occur. At
June 30, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the
Credit Agreement.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
$300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the
notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the
“make-whole” redemption price. The
“make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
basis (assuming a

360-day

year consisting
of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
reflected as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
preferred stock or common stock.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022.
These debentures are convertible at a conversion price of
$22.625 during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our
common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading day period ending on the last trading day of the prior
calendar quarter, is more than $24.8875, and in certain other
circumstances as described in

Note 16: Net Income Per
Share

in the Notes. Based upon satisfaction of the market
price trigger as of the end of the calendar quarter ended
June 30, 2006, these debentures are convertible during the
calendar quarter ended September 30, 2006 into shares of
our common stock.

In addition to our $150 million 3.5% Convertible
Debentures and $300 million 5% Notes mentioned above,
we have outstanding unsecured long-term debt securities of
$250.9 million. The earliest maturity date of any such
long-term debt securities is fiscal 2008.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
$40.0 million from various international banks,
$39.8 million of which was available on June 30, 2006.
These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
terms as mutually agreed to by the banks



and us and are reviewed annually for renewal or modification.
These lines do not require compensating balances. We have a
short-term commercial paper program in place, which we may
utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. There were no
borrowings under the commercial paper program at June 30,
2006.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB” by Standard and
Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by Moody’s
Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating ratios,
fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient
for retention of or improvement to these debt ratings. There are
no assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in the
future. If our credit rating is lowered below “investment
grade,” then we may not be able to issue short-term
commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow under our
credit facilities or pursue other options. We do not currently
foresee losing our investment-grade debt ratings, but no
assurances can be given, however. If our debt ratings were
downgraded, however, it could adversely impact, among other
things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

Contractual Obligations

At June 30, 2006, we had contractual cash obligations to
repay debt to purchase goods and services and to make payments
under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term
obligations are as follows:

    Government Communications Systems segment, which are fully
    funded under contracts with the U.S. Government and
    $99.5 million of these purchase obligations relate to
    cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

There is a $9.0 million potential payment to the former
owners of OSi if certain financial performance criteria are met
in the future. There is also a potential payment to the former
owners of Question d’Image, which we purchased in fiscal
2005, if certain financial performance criteria are met.
Liabilities are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
for these potential payments until the performance criteria have
been met. If the performance criteria related to these payments
are met in the future, we will accrue the liability and adjust
goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period that
the performance criteria are met.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
as defined above. As of June 30, 2006, we did not have
material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In
addition, we are not currently a party to any related party
transactions that materially affect our results of operations,
cash flows or financial condition.



We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover
various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental
liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot estimate the
potential liability from such representations, warranties and
indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. We do not
believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these
representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
the event any of these third parties vacate any of these
premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not
material to our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Commercial Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
performance on certain contracts to provide products and
services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our
insurance carriers. At June 30, 2006, we had commercial
commitments on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and
other arrangements, as follows:

Financial Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use foreign
exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and
off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments.
Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign
currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from
suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed sales
to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use of
foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks
that arise from doing business in international markets. At
June 30, 2006, we had open foreign exchange contracts with
a notional amount of $45.7 million, of which
$15.7 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$30.0 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $73.3 million at July 1, 2005, of which
$48.6 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$24.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
June 30, 2006, contract expiration dates ranged from less
than one month to 20 months with a weighted average
contract life of 3 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
exposures from cash flows anticipated in our RF Communications
segment related to three programs in the U.K. and one in Romania
and payments to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of
our government contracts in our Government Communications
Systems segment. We have hedged the forecasted



cash flows related to payments made to our U.S. operations
to maintain our anticipated profit margins. We also have hedged
U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
anticipated profit margins in our U.K. operations. As of
June 30, 2006, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
$0.2 million would be reclassified into net income from
comprehensive income within the next 20 months related to
these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No amounts were
recognized in our net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004
related to the component of the derivative instruments’
gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in our
net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 related to hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of
these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on the
balance sheet in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”).

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging
programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
derivatives held at June 30, 2006 would have an impact of
approximately $3.2 million on the fair value of such
instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
commitments.

Interest Rates:

We utilize a balanced mix of debt
maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and
available lines of credit to manage our exposure to changes in
interest rates. We do not expect changes in interest rates to
have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal 2007,
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
change significantly.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 44 percent of our international business was
transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2006,
compared to 42 percent in fiscal 2005. The impact of
translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
U.S. dollars is included as a component of
shareholders’ equity. At June 30, 2006, the cumulative
translation adjustment increased shareholders’ equity by
$11.8 million compared to a reduction of $3.3 million
at July 1, 2005. We utilize foreign currency hedging
instruments to minimize the currency risk of international
transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate
fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in
fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
cost of purchased materials and services.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the estimates
discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial
statements because their application places the most significant
demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results
relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical
accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs.
The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates
on our business operations are discussed throughout this
MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected
financial results. Senior management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting policies
and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation of
this Annual Report on
Form

10-K

requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
estimates, whether or not deemed



critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other
information available prior to the issuance of the financial
statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known,
including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”

Revenue Recognition on Development and Production Contracts
and Contract Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
development and production contracts, which are accounted for
under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position
No.

81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP

81-1”),

and cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. Government
also are specifically accounted for in accordance with
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 11,
Section A, “Government Contracts, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee
Contracts” (“ARB 43”).

Revenue related to development and production contracts is
recorded using the

percentage-of

-completion
method generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
to-date against estimated total contract costs at completion

(“cost-to

-cost”)
with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
profit. The

percentage-of

-completion
method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments. Revenue is recorded on certain development and
production contracts within our RF Communications segment using
the

units-of

-delivery
method rather than the

cost-to

-cost method.
Under the

units-of

-delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items that may change the scope of a contract
are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated
and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award
fees applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
solely on a single significant event, generally are not
recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally are not
segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the segmenting
criteria stated in
SOP

81-1.

Under the

percentage-of

-completion
method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire
period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and
production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the
contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at
completion, and the measurement of progress toward completion.
The estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the
difference between the estimated contract value and the
estimated total cost at completion. Due to the long-term nature
of many of our programs, developing the estimated total cost at
completion often requires significant judgment. Factors that
must be considered in estimating the work to be completed
include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature
and complexity of the work to be performed, availability and
cost of materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of
delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the
customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
contract included in any estimate to complete. We review cost
performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts
at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a
change in estimated cost to complete a contract is determined to
have an impact on contract earnings, we will record a positive
or negative adjustment to estimated earnings when identified.
Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable contract are
recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal
to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. These
profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of allowable
costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement. Thus,
cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to the
same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We have
not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to
estimate our costs related to development and production
contracts in the past three fiscal years.

As of June 30, 2006, the amount of unbilled costs and
accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts classified as
Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was
$137.3 million compared to $87.2 million as of
July 1, 2005. These amounts include gross costs and accrued
income, which is netted against billings and progress payments.
A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs
could have a material effect on our statement of financial
position and results of operations. For example, a one percent
variance in our estimate of accrued income booked as of
June 30, 2006 on all open fixed-price contracts would
impact our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
services by $6.7 million.



Provisions for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand,
anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
review of excess and obsolete inventory primarily relates to all
of our business segments. Several factors may influence the sale
and use of our inventories, including our decisions to exit a
product line, technological change and new product development.
These factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
recognize such costs in “Cost of product sales” in our
Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
determination. Likewise, if we determine our inventory is
undervalued, we may have overstated “Cost of product
sales” in previous periods and would be required to
recognize such additional income. We have not made any material
changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our
inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.

As of June 30, 2006, our reserve for excess and obsolete
inventory was $69.7 million, or 12.9 percent of our
gross inventory balance, which compares to our reserve of
$68.2 million, or 16.4 percent of our gross inventory
balance as of July 1, 2005. We recorded $81.3 million,
$4.0 million and $5.0 million in inventory write-downs
that either reduced our reserve for excess and obsolete
inventory or our pre-tax income during fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. In fiscal 2006, we had significant
write-downs in inventory due to the discontinuance of legacy
products in our Microwave Communications segment and the
relocation of European manufacturing activities in our Broadcast
Communications segment. Although we make every reasonable effort
to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product
demand, including the impact of planned future product launches,
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
inventory and our reported operating results.

Valuation of Selected Investments

Selected investments are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting and are evaluated for impairment if cost exceeds fair
value. For those investments that are illiquid and privately
held securities that do not have readily determinable fair
values, the determination of fair value requires management to
obtain independent appraisals, or to estimate the value of the
securities without an independent appraisal based upon available
information such as projected cash flows, comparable market
prices of similar companies, recent acquisitions of similar
companies made in the marketplace and a review of the financial
and market conditions of the underlying company. We use judgment
in estimating the fair value based on our evaluation of the
investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate, terminal
value and long-term growth rate to apply in our calculations. In
instances where a security is subject to liquidation preferences
or transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based
primarily on the quoted price of the same security without
liquidation preferences or transfer restrictions but may be
reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such preferences or
restrictions. In addition, even where the value of a selected
investment is derived from an independent market price or broker
or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be required to
determine whether our selected investment is more or less
marketable than those investments being quoted. We evaluate our
selected investments for “other-than-temporary”
impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of a
selected investment has been, or is expected to be, below the
carrying value for an extended period of time. If an
“other-than-temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the selected
investment recorded on the financial statements and fair value
is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the
impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. We have not
made any material changes in the methodology used to determine
the valuation of our selected investments during the past three
fiscal years.

As of June 30, 2006, the carrying amount of our selected
investments that are included in the “Other assets”
caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet is $33.5 million,
which compares to $39.3 million as of July 1, 2005.
Independent appraisals were obtained to derive the fair value of
these investments and a $5.8 million other-than-temporary
impairment was recognized on these investments in fiscal 2006.
We make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our
estimate of the value of our selected investments. Any
significant unanticipated changes in the underlying assumptions
used by independent appraisers or us could have a significant
impact on these estimates.



Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”), we are required
to perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more
frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment
is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as one of our business segments, with its net
book value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second
step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
to acquire the reporting unit. We have not made any material
changes in the methodology used to determine the valuation of
our goodwill or the assessment of whether or not goodwill is
impaired during the past three fiscal years.

There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the
determination of the fair value of a reporting unit. These
assumptions include projected cash flows, discount rates,
comparable market prices of similar businesses, recent
acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace and a
review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying
business. We completed impairment tests as of March 30,
2006, with no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30,
2006 and July 1, 2005 was $951.1 million and
$569.9 million, respectively. Although we make every
reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the
fair value of our reporting units, future changes in the
assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the
recording of an impairment loss. A 10 percent decrease in
our estimate of our Broadcast Communications segment’s fair
value would lead to further tests for impairment as described
above. A 10 percent decrease, however, in our estimate of
our other three segment’s fair value would not lead to
further tests for impairment as described above.

Income Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We
have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three
fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2006 includes
a current deferred tax asset of $105.0 million and a
non-current deferred tax liability of $28.6 million. This
compares to a current deferred tax asset of $96.0 million
and a non-current deferred tax liability of $26.7 million
as of July 1, 2005. For all jurisdictions for which we have
net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of
pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future
taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation
allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $70.4 million as of
June 30, 2006 and $47.7 million as of July 1,
2005. The increase in valuation allowance from fiscal 2005 to
fiscal 2006 is primarily due to inventory write-downs and plant
closures in Canada and Europe and the acquisition of Leitch.
Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy
of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss
in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient
future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the
actual effective tax rates or time period within which the
underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible,
we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against
all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets
resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate
and a material adverse impact on our operating results.



Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

Effective July 2, 2005, we adopted Statement 123R,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all stock-based payments made to our employees,
including employee stock option, performance share, performance
unit, restricted stock and restricted unit awards based on
estimated fair value. We previously applied the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”) and related interpretations and
provided the required pro forma disclosures under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“Statement 123”).

We adopted Statement 123R using the modified prospective
transition method beginning in fiscal 2006. Accordingly, during
fiscal 2006 we recorded stock-based compensation expense for
awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of the beginning
of fiscal 2006 as if the fair value method required for pro
forma disclosure under Statement 123 were in effect for
expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
For stock-based awards granted after the beginning of fiscal
2006, we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated
grant date fair value method required under Statement 123R.
The compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a
straight-line amortization method. Our net income for fiscal
2006 includes a stock-based compensation expense of
$18.6 million, or $.09 per share. As of June 30,
2006, the total unrecorded stock-based compensation balance for
unvested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was
$27.2 million, which is expected to be amortized over a
weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

While fair value may be readily determinable for awards of
stock, market quotes are not available for long-term,
nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not
traded. We currently use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model to estimate the fair value of stock options. Option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including but not limited to stock price volatility
and stock option exercise behavior. We expect to continue to use
the Black-Scholes-Merton model for valuing our stock-based
compensation expense. However, our estimate of future
stock-based compensation expense will be affected by a number of
items including our stock price, the number of stock options we
may grant in the future, as well as a number of complex and
subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect.
These valuation assumptions include, but are not limited to, the
volatility of our stock price, expected life and stock option
exercise behaviors. We have not made any material changes in the
methodologies used to determine the assumptions we use to
estimate the fair value of our stock options during the past
three fiscal years.

A change in any of these assumptions could materially affect the
estimated fair value of any given grant and cause our results to
be materially different. For example, a one-year increase in the
estimated term of our stock options granted during fiscal 2006
would have increased our compensation expense by
$0.9 million in fiscal 2006 and a 400 basis-point increase
in the assumed volatility rate of our stock options granted
during fiscal 2006 would have increased our compensation expense
by $0.7 million in fiscal 2006. See

Note 15: Stock
Options and Share-Based Compensation

in the Notes for
further information related to stock options and share-based
compensation.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

As described in

Note 3: Accounting Changes or Recent
Pronouncements

in the Notes, there are accounting
pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet
been implemented by us.

Note 3

describes the
potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE
RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
actual results to differ materially from expected and historical
results. Other factors besides those listed here also could
adversely affect us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
above for more information regarding factors that might cause
our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report on
Form

10-K.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We depend on the U.S. Government for a significant portion
    of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding priorities could have adverse
    consequences on our future business.



•

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts,
    which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns.

•

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business in foreign countries, including fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products that achieve market acceptance.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may affect adversely the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

•

The inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key
    suppliers to deliver our components or products, could cause our
    products to be produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing upon their intellectual property
    rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual
    property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse affect on our financial
    position and results of operations.

•

We are subject to customer credit risk.

•

The fair values of our portfolio of passive investments are
    subject to significant price volatility or erosion.

•

Developing new technologies entails significant risks and
    uncertainties.

•

We have significant operations in Florida that could be
    materially and adversely impacted in the event of a hurricane,
    and operations in California that could be materially and
    adversely impacted in the event of an earthquake.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
    RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
our exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies
and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance, based on an appropriate cost-benefit
analysis, regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s
assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2006.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
internal controls of Leitch Technology Corporation
(“Leitch”) acquired by the Company during fiscal 2006,
which is included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements
of the Company and constituted $543 million and
$481 million of total assets and net assets, respectively,
as of June 30, 2006. Leitch’s revenue was
$154 million for the year ended June 30, 2006.
Leitch’s total assets and net assets as of June 30,
2006 were 17 percent and 29 percent of the
Company’s total assets and net assets, respectively.
Leitch’s revenue for the year ended June 30, 2006 was
4 percent of the Company’s total revenue. Management
will include the internal controls of Leitch in its assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting for fiscal 2007.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on
management’s assessment and the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This
report appears on page 55.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Harris Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and
July 1, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows, and comprehensive income and
shareholders’ equity, for each of the three years in the
period ended June 30, 2006. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(1). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries at
June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Harris Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated August 25, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of Harris Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of Harris Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Harris Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Harris Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of Leitch Technology Corporation (“Leitch”),
which is included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements
of Harris Corporation and constituted $543 million and
$481 million of total assets and net assets, respectively,
as of June 30, 2006. Leitch’s revenue was
$154 million for the year ended June 30, 2006. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting of Harris
Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of Leitch.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Harris
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity, for each of
the three years in the period ended June 30, 2006 and our
report dated August 25, 2006, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
and its subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, the terms “Harris,”
“we,” “our” and “us” refer to
Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated.

Use of Estimates

— These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based
on experience and other information available prior to issuance
of the financial statements. Materially different results can
occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes
known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2006 includes 52 weeks,
fiscal 2005 includes 52 weeks, and fiscal 2004 includes
53 weeks.

Common Stock Split

— On February 25, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a 100 percent stock dividend to our stockholders of
record on March 14, 2005. The distribution of shares was
completed on March 30, 2005. The total number of authorized
shares and associated par value were unchanged by this action.
As required, we transferred on our books the par value of
$1 per share for each share distributed on March 30,
2005 from other capital to common stock. All share and per-share
amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated
Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
and Shareholders’ Equity and these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements reflect the stock split, applied
retroactively, for all periods presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
months when purchased. These investments include accrued
interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Short-term Investments

— Investments with
original maturities greater than three months are accounted for
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities,” and are classified accordingly at
the time of purchase. At June 30, 2006, our investment in
short-term investments consisted primarily of investment grade
auction rate preferred stock with no maturity and investment
grade auction rate municipal notes and bonds with maturities
that could range from 16 years to 28 years. These
investments have characteristics similar to short-term
investments, because at pre-determined intervals, generally
ranging from 29 to 49 days, there is a new auction process
at which the interest rates for these Auction Rate Securities
(“ARS”) are reset to current interest rates. At the
end of such period, we choose to roll-over our holdings or
redeem the investments for cash. A “market maker”
facilitates the redemption of the ARS and the underlying issuers
are not required to redeem the investment within 90 days.
All of these short-term investments were classified as
available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Due to the
frequent nature of the reset feature, the investment’s
market price approximates its fair value; therefore, there are
no realized or unrealized gains or losses associated with these
investments. See the caption “Reclassifications” in
this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

for
additional information.

Selected Investments

— Selected investments are
investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
estimate the value of the securities without an independent
appraisal based upon available information such as projected
cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
underlying company. “Non-operating income (loss)” in
our Consolidated Statement of Income included impairment
write-downs of $1.8 million related to our investment in
AuthenTec, Inc. and $4.0 million related to our investment
in Terion, Inc. in fiscal 2006; and $3.8 million related to
our investment in AuthenTec, Inc., $2.9 million related to
our investment in Terion, Inc. and $1.0 million related to
our interest in Teltronics, Inc. in fiscal 2005. These
write-downs were the result of less than expected operating
results and downward revisions of forecasted future results.
$33.5 million of selected investments at June 30, 2006
and $39.3 million at July 1, 2005 are included in the
“Other assets” caption on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. We obtained independent



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

appraisals for these selected investments to determine their
fair value during fiscal 2006. See

Note 9: Selected
Investments

for additional information.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cost method
investments, non-current receivables, notes receivable and
short-term and long-term debt approximate their fair values,
except for our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022, which
have a fair value in excess of their carrying value. Fair values
are based primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
instruments or independent appraisals. A discussion of fair
values for our derivative financial instruments is included
under the caption “Financial Instruments and Risk
Management” in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting
Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for
estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated
on the accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision
for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our
history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic
status of the customers. See

Note 5: Receivables

for
additional information.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out
methods) or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. See

Note 6: Inventories

for
additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
and equipment are carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of
buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 50 years.
The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
range between 3 and 10 years. See

Note 7: Property,
Plant and Equipment

for additional information regarding
property, plant and equipment.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
tax planning strategies. See

Note 22: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess cost
of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
acquired. In accordance with Statement 142, indefinite-life
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as our business segments, with its net book
value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any
unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

for additional information regarding
goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangible
Assets

— We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
the asset, a loss



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

would be recognized for the difference between the fair value
and the carrying amount. Identifiable intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

and

Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for
additional information regarding long-lived assets and
identifiable intangible assets.

Other Accrued Items and Other Assets

— No
accrued liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other
accrued items” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed
5 percent of our total current liabilities as of
June 30, 2006 or as of July 1, 2005. No current assets
other than those already disclosed on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet exceed 5 percent of our total current assets as of
June 30, 2006 or as of July 1, 2005. No assets within
the caption “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet exceed 5 percent of total assets as of June 30,
2006 or as of July 1, 2005.

Warranties

— On development and production
contract sales in our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments, the value or price of our warranty is
generally included in the contract and funded by the customer. A
provision for warranties is built into the estimated program
costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when applying
the

cost-to

-cost
percentage of completion revenue recognition method. Warranty
costs, if incurred, are charged to the specific program’s
cost and both revenue and cost are recognized at that time.
Factors that affect the estimated program cost for warranty
include terms of the contract, number of installed units,
historical experience and management’s judgment regarding
anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim.

On product sales in our RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments, we provide
for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific
terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
product sold and country in which we do business. In the case of
products sold by us, our warranties generally start from the
delivery date and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to twelve years

Microwave Communications

Two to three years

Broadcast Communications

One to five years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of installed units, historical experience and
management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
Communications segment and network management software products
sold by our Microwave Communications segment generally carry a
30- to

90-day

warranty
from the date of customer acceptance. Our liability under these
warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of any portion
of the software found not to be in substantial compliance with
the agreed upon specifications, or to provide a full refund.

Software license agreements in our Broadcast Communications and
Microwave Communications segments generally include provisions
for indemnifying customers against certain specified liabilities
should our software products infringe a third party’s
intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any
material costs as a result of such indemnification and have not
accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our
consolidated financial statements. See

Note 10: Accrued
Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
of exchange and income and expense items are translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Unearned Compensation

— Prior to the
July 2, 2005 start of our fiscal year 2006, we accounted
for the share-based compensation granted under our stock
incentive plans under the recognition and measurement provisions
of APB 25. In accordance with APB 25 compensation
resulting from performance shares granted under our stock
incentive plan was amortized to expense over the performance
period and adjusted for changes in the market value of our
common stock.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

—
Prior to the July 2, 2005 start of our fiscal year 2006, we
accounted for the share-based compensation granted under our
stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement
provisions of APB 25. In accordance with APB 25 we
used the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option
awards to employees and accordingly did not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
our Consolidated Statement of Income, as all option exercise
prices were 100 percent of fair market value on the date
the options were granted. Effective July 2, 2005, we
implemented Statement 123R for all share-based compensation
that was not vested as of the end of our fiscal year 2005. In
accordance with Statement 123R, we measure compensation
cost for all share-based payments (including employee stock
options) at fair value and recognize cost over the vesting
period. It is our policy to issue shares when options are
exercised. We also repurchase shares of our common stock to
offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock
incentive plans. See

Note 3: Accounting Changes or
Recent Pronouncements

and

Note 15: Stock Options and
Share-Based Compensation

for additional information
regarding stock options, performance shares and restricted stock
including the impact of implementing Statement 123R on our
results of operations and cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
following revenue recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems segment:

Revenue in our
Government Communications Systems segment primarily relates to
development and production contracts. Recognition of profit on
development and production fixed-price contracts requires
estimates of: the total contract value; the total cost at
completion; and the measurement of progress towards completion.
Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable contracts are
recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, and
become billable to the customer, in an amount equal to the
allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. Revenue and
anticipated profits under development and production contracts
are recorded on a

percentage-of

-completion
basis, generally using the

cost-to

-cost method of
accounting where sales and profits are recorded based on the
ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion.
Contracts are combined when specific aggregation criteria stated
in SOP 81-1 are met. Criteria generally include closely
interrelated activities performed for a single customer within
the same economic environment. Contracts generally are not
segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the segmenting
criteria stated in SOP 81-1. Amounts representing contract
change orders, claims or other items are included in sales only
when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable.
Incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on
contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates
and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions, which
increase earnings based solely on a single significant event,
are generally not recognized until the event occurs. When
adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product sales other than
development and production contracts and revenue from service
arrangements, which are recognized when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable,
collectibility is probable, delivery of a product has occurred,
and title has transferred or services have been rendered.
Further, if an arrangement other than a development and
production contract requires the delivery or performance of
multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we
determine whether the individual elements represent
“separate units of accounting” under the requirements
of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue

00-21,

“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”
(“EITF

00-21”).

If the separate elements meet the requirements listed in
EITF

00-21,

we
recognize the revenue associated with each element separately
and contract revenue is allocated among elements based on
relative fair value. If the elements within a bundled sale are
not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an
individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
are undelivered elements that are essential to the
functionality. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized
by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts.
Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance
exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless
these obligations are satisfied.

RF Communications segment:

Revenue in our RF
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue recognition from development and production
contracts and other than development and production contracts
sales follows the same policies as stated under our Government
Communications Systems segment’s revenue recognition policy
above except that our RF Communications segment sometimes uses
the

units-of

-delivery
method of accounting rather than the

cost-to

-cost method of
accounting for production contracts that call for the delivery
of larger quantities of products. Under the

units-of

-delivery
method, sales and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

profits are recorded based on the ratio of actual units
delivered to estimated total units to be delivered under the
contract.

Microwave Communications segment:

Revenue in our
Microwave Communications segment primarily relates to product
and services sales. Revenue recognition from development and
production contracts and other than development and production
contracts sales follows the same policies as stated under our
Government Communications Systems segment’s revenue
recognition policy above.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in our
Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to product
and services sales and software licenses. Revenue recognition
from development and production contracts and other than
development and production contracts sales follows the same
policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. This segment
derives a portion of its revenue from the licensing of software
with multi-year maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue
allocated to undelivered elements under these bundled software
licenses is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under
the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered
elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is
recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the
undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to
delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements
is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the
maintenance agreement.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a component of
“Non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis of terms
specified in contractual agreements. Shipping and handling fees
billed to customers are classified on the Consolidated Statement
of Income as “Revenue from product sales” and the
associated costs are classified in “Cost of product
sales.” Also, we record taxes collected from customers and
remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in that they
are excluded from revenues.

Retirement Benefits

— As of June 30, 2006,
we provide retirement benefits to substantially all domestic
employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
plan having profit sharing, matching and savings elements.
Contributions by us to the retirement plan are based on profits
and employees’ savings with no other funding requirements.
We may make additional contributions to the plan at our
discretion. Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited
healthcare plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and
employees on long-term disability. We accrue the estimated cost
of these medical benefits, which are not material, during an
employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expense amounted to $103.9 million in
fiscal 2006, $87.0 million in fiscal 2005 and
$71.8 million in fiscal 2004.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 16 sites
where future liabilities could exist. These sites include two
sites owned by us, seven sites associated with our former
graphics or semiconductor locations and seven treatment or
disposal sites not owned by us that contain hazardous substances
allegedly attributable to us from past operations. Based on an
assessment of relevant factors, we have estimated that our
discounted liability under the Superfund Act and other
environmental statutes and regulations for identified sites,
using a 7.5 percent discount rate, is approximately
$4.3 million. This liability is accrued in the
June 30, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expected
aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the
next 15 to 20 years (depending on the number of years for
each site) is approximately $6.6 million. The expected
payments for the next five years are: fiscal 2007 —
$0.6 million; fiscal 2008 — $1.0 million;
fiscal 2009 — $0.6 million; fiscal
2010 — $0.7 million; fiscal 2011 —
$0.4 million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is
approximately $3.3 million. The relevant factors we
considered in estimating our potential liabilities under the
Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
include cost-sharing agreements with other parties and the
potential indemnification from successor and predecessor owners
of these sites. We do not believe that uncertainties with
respect to these relevant factors would materially affect our
potential liability under the Superfund Act and other
environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
Commitments

— Guarantees are contingent
commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. The
terms of the guarantees are equal to the remaining term



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the related debt, which are limited to one year or less. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required
to make under our guarantees at June 30, 2006 is
$0.4 million. At June 30, 2006, there are no
guarantees accrued for in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We
also hold insurance policies with third parties to mitigate the
risk of loss on a portion of these guarantees. We have entered
into commercial commitments in the normal course of business
including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and
other arrangements with financial institutions and customers
primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on
certain contracts to provide products and services to customers
and to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. At
June 30, 2006, we had commercial commitments of
$81.4 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

—
Statement 133 requires us to recognize all derivatives on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that
are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If
the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset
against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a combination of
foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts
to hedge against risks associated with anticipated cash flows
that are probable of occurring in the future and cash flows that
are fixed or firmly committed. These derivatives have only
nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase and have a high
degree of correlation to the anticipated cash flows they are
designated to hedge. Hedge effectiveness is determined by the
correlation of the anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates
of the derivatives used to hedge these cash flows. We do not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge against the
currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with
anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement 133, such financial instruments are

marked-to

-market using
forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. The foreign
currency options and forward contracts are subsequently
recognized as a component of “Cost of product sales”
on the Consolidated Statement of Income when the underlying net
cash flows are realized. Unrealized losses are recorded in
“Other accrued items” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of
hedge ineffectiveness. Unrealized gains are recorded as
“Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
the offset to other comprehensive income, net of hedge
ineffectiveness.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
position with each counterparty. In the event of the termination
of a derivative designated as a hedge, the settlement would be
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as a component
of “Non-operating income (loss).”

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is
based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year. See

Note 16: Net Income
Per Share

for additional information regarding net income
per share.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements
to conform with current-year classifications. These
reclassifications include: moving additions of capitalized
software from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows
from investing activities on our Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, including unbilled costs and accrued earnings on
fixed-price contracts within inventories on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet and changing the classification of the reduction
of income tax paid as a result of the deduction related to
employees’ exercise of stock options from financing
activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows.

Investments in investment grade ARS are classified as short-term
investments. ARS generally have long-term stated maturities, or
no maturities in the case of auction rate preferred stock. These
investments have characteristics similar to short-term
investments, because at pre-determined intervals, generally
ranging from 29 to 49 days, there is a new auction process
at which the interest rates for these ARS are reset to current
interest rates. At the end of such period, we choose to
roll-over our holdings or redeem the investments for cash. A
“market maker” facilitates the redemption of the ARS
and the underlying issuers are not required to redeem



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the investment within 90 days. Previously, such investments
had been classified as cash and cash equivalents due to their
liquidity and pricing reset feature. We have revised the
classification to present these securities as short-term
investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We did not hold
any ARS as of July 1, 2005. We also revised the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal 2004 and 2005 to
reflect the purchase and sales of ARS as investing activities
rather than a component of cash and cash equivalents, which is
consistent with the presentation for fiscal 2006. In the
previously reported Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 net cash used in investing
activities related to these short-term investments of
$69.9 million and net cash provided by investing activities
related to these short-term investments of $196.0 million,
respectively, was included in cash and cash equivalents.

NOTE 2:

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On May 28, 2004, we completed the sale of our tools and
test systems (“TTS”) product line, which was included
in our former Network Support segment, for approximately
$43.1 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. As a result of this transaction, the TTS product
line has been reported as a discontinued operation for all
periods presented.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of land, buildings,
equipment, inventory, receivables, technology and other assets
related to the operation of the TTS product line. We recorded an
after-tax gain on the sale of our TTS product line of
$9.1 million. This gain was net of the disposal of
$13.8 million of related goodwill.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES OR RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP
106-2”), with an effective date for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. FSP 106-2
relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Medicare Prescription Drug
Act”), which was signed into law on December 8, 2003.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Act introduced a prescription
drug benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we adopted the
provisions of FSP 106-2. Our retirees who are Medicare-eligible
pay retiree premiums equal to the cost of their coverage. We
subsidize the healthcare coverage for disabled employees, some
of whom are Medicare-eligible. After the acceptance of our
disabled employee coverage application, we obtained an actuarial
valuation and recorded the impact of the subsidy in our
accumulated post-retirement benefit and net periodic
post-retirement benefit cost. The federal subsidy for disabled
employees who are Medicare-eligible did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 151, “Inventory
Costs — an amendment of Accounting Research
Bulletin 43, Chapter 4”
(“Statement 151”). Statement 151 clarifies
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material. Paragraph 5 of
Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) 43,
Chapter 4 “Inventory Pricing,” previously stated
that “. . . under certain circumstances,
items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require
treatment as current-period charges.” Statement 151
requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of
“so abnormal.” In addition, Statement 151
requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. Statement 151 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We implemented
the provisions of Statement 151 during the first quarter of
fiscal 2006, and it did not have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement 123R, which
requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all
share-based payments (including employee stock options) at fair
value and to recognize cost over the vesting period. In March
2005, the SEC released SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment”
(“SAB 107”). SAB 107 provides the SEC staff
position regarding the application of Statement 123R,
including interpretive guidance related to the interaction
between Statement 123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations, and provides the staff’s views regarding the
valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
companies. In April 2005, the SEC announced that companies
should implement Statement 123R at the beginning of their
next fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, or
December 15, 2005 for small business issuers. We
implemented the provisions of Statement 123R and
SAB 107 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the
modified-prospective method, and it did not have a material
impact on our financial position. See

Note 15: Stock
Options and Share-Based Compensation

for further information
and the required disclosures under Statement 123R and
SAB 107, including the impact of the implementation on our
results of operations and cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections” (“Statement 154”), which
replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes”
and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.” Statement 154 changes the requirements
for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. Statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes
in accounting principles and applies to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the
pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.
Statement 154 requires retroactive application to
prior-period financial statements for a change in accounting
principle. Previously, a change in accounting principle was
recognized by including the change in the net income in the
period of the change. Statement 154 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2005. We implemented the
provisions of Statement 154 in the first quarter of fiscal
2006, and it did not have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Forces
(“EITF”) Issue No. 05-06, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements”
(“Issue

05-06”).

Issue

05-06

provides that the amortization period used for leasehold
improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased
after the inception of a lease be the shorter of (a) the
useful life of the assets or (b) a term that includes
required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured
upon the acquisition or the purchase. The provisions of
Issue

05-06

are
effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements
purchased or acquired beginning in our second quarter of fiscal
2006. We implemented the provisions of
Issue

05-06

in the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, and it did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments” (“FSP FAS 115-1 and
FAS 124-1”). FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1
address the determination as to when an impairment in equity
securities (including cost method investments) and debt
securities that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise

nullifies certain requirements under EITF Issue
No.

03-01,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments” that required the
investor to make an evidence-based judgment as to whether it has
the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable
period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair
value up to (or beyond) the cost of the investment in
determining whether the impairment was other-than-temporary, and
the measurement of the impairment loss. The guidance in FSP
FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 is effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We implemented
the provisions of FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 in the
third quarter of fiscal 2006 and it did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-3,
“Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” (“FSP
123R-3”). FSP 123R-3 provides a simplified alternative
method to calculate the beginning pool of excess tax benefits
against which excess future deferred tax assets (that result
when the compensation cost recognized for an award exceeds the
ultimate tax deduction) could be written off under
Statement 123R. The guidance in FSP 123R-3 was effective on
November 10, 2005. We may make a one-time election to adopt
the transition method described in FSP 123R-3 before
November 10, 2006. We are currently evaluating the
available transition alternatives of FSP 123R-3. We currently
have implemented the provisions of Statement 123R following
the guidance for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits
described in paragraph 81 of Statement 123R and the
guidance related to reporting cash flows described in
paragraph 68 of Statement 123R. If we elect the
alternative method described in
FSP

123R-3,

the
effect of applying the transition method described in FSP 123R-3
must be reported as a change in accounting principle in
accordance with Statement 154 and the financial results for
periods subsequent to the adoption of Statement 123R must
be retroactively restated. We will not be required, however, to
justify the preferability of our election, if we elect the
transition method described in FSP 123R-3, and we are free to
choose either approach to the calculation of the pool of excess
tax benefits. We do not believe the adoption of this FSP 123R-3
will have a material impact on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In February 2006, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-4,
“Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued
as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the
Occurrence of a Contingent Event” (“FSP 123R-4”).
FSP 123R-4 addresses the classification of options and similar
instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash
settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event. A cash
settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the
occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the
employee’s control does not meet the conditions in
paragraphs 32 and A229 of Statement 123R until it
becomes probable that the event will occur. The guidance in FSP
123R-4 was effective on February 3, 2006. We implemented
the provisions of FSP 123R-4 during the third quarter of fiscal
2006 and it did not have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2006 the FASB ratified EITF
issue

06-3,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)”
(“Issue

06-3”).

The Task Force reached a conclusion that the presentation of
taxes such as sales, use, value added, and excise taxes on
either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net
(excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision
that should be disclosed by the company. In addition, the
company should disclose the amounts of those taxes such as
sales, use, value added, and excise taxes that are reported on a
gross basis in interim and annual financial statements for each
period for which an income statement is presented if those
amounts are significant. The provisions of
Issue

06-3

are
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2006. We have disclosed that we record
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
authorities on a net basis. Our early adoption of
Issue

06-3

did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006, which is our fiscal 2008. We are
currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on
our financial statements.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2005 we made the following acquisitions:

•

The Orkand Corporation (“Orkand”), a privately-held
    provider of technical services and information technology for
    U.S. Government agencies.

•

Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc. (“Encoda”), a
    privately-held, global supplier of software solutions and
    services for the broadcast media industry, with television,
    radio, cable, satellite and advertising agency customers.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal 2006 we made the following acquisitions:

•

Leitch Technology Corporation (“Leitch”), a
    publicly-held provider of high-performance video systems for the
    television broadcast industry.

•

Optimal Solutions, Inc. (“OSi”), a privately-held
    provider of air-time sales, traffic and billing software systems
    to over 350 call-letter broadcast stations in North America.

•

Aastra Digital Video, a business unit of Aastra Technologies
    Limited. Aastra Digital Video develops and markets video
    networking, encoding, decoding, and multiplexing technologies
    used by television broadcasters, telecommunications providers
    and satellite networks.

The following tables provide further detail for each of these
acquisitions:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

All of these acquisitions have been accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and accordingly, their results of
operations have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Income and Cash Flows since their acquisition date. The purchase
prices of the Orkand and Encoda acquisitions give effect to
post-closing adjustments while the purchase prices of OSi and
Aastra Digital Video remain subject to post-closing adjustments.
The amount of consideration to the former shareholders and
option holders of these business combinations was paid out of
our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The purchase
price allocation is preliminary for all of these acquisitions
with respect to tax assets and liabilities and is preliminary
for other assets and liabilities for the Leitch, OSi and Aastra
Digital Video acquisitions. The goodwill resulting from the
Orkand, Encoda, Leitch and OSi acquisitions is not deductible
for tax purposes while the goodwill related to the Aastra
Digital Video acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The
write-offs of in-process research and development noted in the
above table were included in “Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of
Income. We obtained the assistance of independent valuation
specialists to assist us in determining the allocation of the
purchase price for all of these acquisitions.

There is a $9.0 million potential additional payment to the
former owners of OSi if certain financial performance criteria
are met in the future. This liability is not reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet or cash paid for acquisition as of
June 30, 2006, since the performance criteria have not been
met. If the performance criteria are met in the future, we will
accrue the liability and adjust goodwill on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet in the period that the performance criteria are
met.

Pro Forma Results

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
unaudited consolidated results of operations as if Orkand,
Encoda and Leitch had been acquired as of the beginning of the
periods presented, after including the impact of adjustments
such as amortization of intangibles, decreased interest income
from the use of cash and cash equivalents and the related income
tax effects. This pro forma presentation does not include any
impact of acquisition synergies.

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of our
results of operations had we owned Orkand, Encoda and Leitch for
the entire periods presented. Leitch’s results for fiscal
2005 and fiscal 2004 include after-tax charges of
$4.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. The
fiscal 2005 charges are associated with staff reductions and
lease exit costs relating to vacating two of three floors leased
by Leitch in Toronto, Canada. The fiscal 2004 charges relate to
staff reductions, discontinuance of product lines and the
closure of a U.K. facility.

Terion, Inc. (“Terion”) is a privately-held company
that provides wireless data communication and information
solutions for mobile and remote

business-to

applications focusing on the transportation industry. It has
sold units to customers such as J.B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. and XTRA Lease, a division of XTRA Corporation. None of
Terion’s revenue is generated from Harris or its
affiliates. We have invested technology and cash in Terion since
fiscal 1994 and we currently nominate one member of
Terion’s board of directors. The maximum exposure to loss
we have with our ownership interest in Terion is
$23.0 million. We use an independent valuation specialist
to assist us in determining the fair value of the investment.

During July 2006, Terion’s largest customer representing
approximately 60,000 units of an installed base of approximately
110,000 units, informed Terion that it had signed a contract
with another provider and would be moving its fleet off of
Terion’s system over the next two years. Terion and the
customer are actively negotiating the terms of the wind down of
their relationship after which Terion management will prepare an
updated outlook and forecast. Though we do not currently have
adequate information to calculate the potential impairment to
our investment, we believe that the required write-down of our
investment will be significant. Once the impairment amount is
determined, we will record the impairment under the caption
“Non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
Agreement replaced our prior $300 million four-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement, dated October 15,
2003. The Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit
to us in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit
issuances at any time and from time to time during the term of
the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to exceed $500 million (we may request
an increase not to exceed $250 million). The Credit
Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes and to support any commercial paper that we
may issue. At our election, borrowings under the Credit
Agreement will bear interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable
margin or at the base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate
equal to the higher of the Federal funds rate plus
0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced
prime lending rate. The Credit Agreement provides that the
interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set at
0.50 percent, will increase or decrease within certain
limits based on changes in the ratings of our senior, unsecured
long-term debt securities. We are also permitted to request
borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set
pursuant to competitive bid procedures or directly negotiated
with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
including payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
$50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
under the Credit Agreement are due and mature on March 31,
2010, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at
our request or if certain events of default occur. At
June 30, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the
Credit Agreement.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
$40.0 million from various international banks,
$39.8 million of which was available on June 30, 2006.
These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and us and are reviewed
annually for renewal or modification. These lines do not require
compensating balances.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have a short-term commercial paper program in place, which we
may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. There were
no borrowings under the commercial paper program at
June 30, 2006.

NOTE 12:

SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $0.2 million at June 30, 2006 and
$4.2 million at July 1, 2005 consists solely of notes
payable to banks in both years. The weighted-average interest
rate for bank notes was 5.5 percent at June 30, 2006
and 8.5 percent at July 1, 2005.

NOTE 13:

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt includes the following:

The potential maturities of long-term debt, including the
current portion, for the five years following fiscal 2006 are:
$1.4 million in fiscal 2007; $299.5 million in fiscal
2008; none in fiscal 2009; none in fiscal 2010; none in fiscal
2011; and $400.0 million thereafter. These potential
maturities take into consideration the possibility that the debt
holders will exercise put options for our 6.35% debentures
in February 2008 and that our 3.5% Convertible Debentures
will be converted into equity in August 2007. All of our
outstanding long-term debt is unsubordinated, unsecured with
equal ranking.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
$300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the
notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the
“make-whole” redemption price. The
“make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
basis (assuming a

360-day

year consisting
of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
reflected as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private placement of
$150 million in aggregate principal amount of our
3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022. The debentures are
unsecured obligations convertible, in certain instances, into
shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
$22.625 per share, subject to adjustment. The debentures
were issued at 100 percent of the principal amount, less a
discount of 2.5 percent to the initial purchasers. We may
redeem the debentures commencing August 2007 at 100 percent
of the principal amount plus accrued interest in cash. Holders
may require us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in
part, on specified dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017 or upon the
occurrence of certain other events at 100 percent of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. The debentures bear
interest at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. The interest
rate will be reset in August 2007, 2012 and 2017, but in no
event will it be reset below 3.5 percent or above
5.5 percent per annum. We incurred $4.8 million in
debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the convertible
debentures, which costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a five-year period and reflected as a portion of
interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

NOTE 14:

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, we declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
common stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by common stock share certificates or
book-entry account statements, trade with the common stock until
they become exercisable, and entitle the holder to purchase one
two-hundredth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock for
$62.50, subject to adjustment. The rights are not exercisable
until the earlier of 10 business days (or such later date fixed
by our Board of Directors) after a party commences a tender or
exchange offer to acquire a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding common stock, or the first
date of public announcement by us that a person has acquired a
beneficial interest of at least 15 percent of our
outstanding common stock, or such later date fixed by our Board
of Directors.

Upon the first date of public announcement by us that a person
has acquired a beneficial interest of at least 15 percent
of our outstanding common stock, or such later date fixed by our
Board of Directors, each right (other than rights beneficially
owned by an acquiring person or any affiliate or associate
thereof) would entitle the holder to purchase shares of our
common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price of the right. In addition, each right (other than rights
beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any affiliate or
associate thereof) would entitle the holder to exercise the
right and receive shares of common stock of the acquiring
company, upon a merger or other business combination, having a
market value of twice the exercise price of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights become exercisable,
the Board of Directors may elect to exchange all of the then
outstanding rights for shares of common stock at an exchange
ratio of one share of common stock per right, subject to
adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and may be
redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per
right at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial
interest of 15 percent of the outstanding common stock.

NOTE 15:

STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of June 30, 2006, we had three shareholder-approved
stock incentive plans for employees under which options or other
share-based compensation is outstanding. We currently have the
following types of share-based awards outstanding under these
plans: stock options, performance share awards, performance
share unit awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock
unit awards. We believe that such awards more closely align the
interests of our employees with those of our shareholders.
Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated vesting if
there is a change in control (as defined under our stock
incentive plans). Shares of common stock remaining available for
future issuance under our stock incentive plans totaled
26,664,427 as of June 30, 2006.

The compensation cost related to our share-based awards that was
charged against income was $18.6 million for the year ended
June 30, 2006. The total income tax benefit included in net
income for share-based compensation arrangements was
$6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2006.
$17.9 million and $0.7 million of the compensation
cost related to share-based compensation arrangements was
included in the “Engineering, selling and administrative
expenses” and the “Cost of product sales and
services” captions, respectively, in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. None of the compensation cost related to
share-based compensation arrangements was capitalized as part of
inventory or fixed assets as of June 30, 2006.

assuming we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement 123R to all previously granted share-based awards
after giving consideration to potential forfeitures during such
periods. The fair value of each option grant is estimated at the
grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
based on the assumptions listed below under

“Stock
Options.

” The estimated fair value of options granted
is amortized to expense over their vesting period, which is
generally 3 years.

The impact of applying the provisions of Statement 123R and
SAB 107 during fiscal 2006 was as follows:

The implementation of Statement 123R decreased our fiscal
2006 cash flow from operating activities by $13.5 million
and increased our cash flow from financing activities by
$13.5 million related to the reduction of income tax paid
as a result of the deduction related to employees’ exercise
of stock options during fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 cash flow from
operations includes $4.2 million related to the reduction
of income tax paid as a result of the deduction related to
employees’ exercise of stock options.

Stock Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
been granted under our shareholder-approved stock incentive
plans. Option exercise prices are 100 percent of fair
market value on the date the options are granted. Options may be
exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally
ranges from 7 to 10 years after the date of grant, and they
generally become exercisable in installments, which are
typically 50 percent one year from the grant date,
25 percent two years from the grant date and
25 percent three years



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

from the grant date. A significant number of options granted by
us in both fiscal 2005 and 2006 are subject to a vesting
schedule in which they are 50 percent exercisable prior to
the end of such fiscal year, a period of approximately
10 months from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which
uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on
our stock, historical volatility of our stock price over the
last ten years and other factors. The expected term of the
options is based on historical observations of our stock over
the past ten years, considering average years to exercise for
all options exercised, average years to cancellation for all
options cancelled and average years remaining for outstanding
options, which is calculated based on the weighted-average
vesting period plus the weighted-average of the difference
between the vesting period and average years to exercise and
cancellation. The risk-free rate for periods within the
contractual life of the option is based on the
U.S. Treasury curve in effect at the time of grant.

1.5 years. The total fair value of stock options that
vested during fiscal 2006 was approximately $11.1 million.

Restricted Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
under our stock incentive plans. The restricted stock and
restricted stock units are not transferable until vested and the
restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment
over a specified time period.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
closing price of our stock on the date of grant and is amortized
to compensation expense over its vesting period. At
June 30, 2006, there were 287,666 shares of restricted
stock outstanding.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
June 30, 2006, we had 59,750 restricted stock units
outstanding.

period of 2.2 years. There were 70,000 shares of
restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during
fiscal 2006. The weighted-average grant date price of the
170,250 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock
units granted during fiscal 2006 was $39.45.

Performance Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
shares and performance share units that have been granted to
employees under our stock incentive plans. Generally,
performance share and performance share unit awards are subject
to performance criteria such as meeting predetermined earnings
and return on invested capital targets for a three-year plan
period. These awards also generally vest at the expiration of
the same three-year period. The final determination of the
number of shares to be issued in respect of an award is
determined by our Board of Directors, or a committee of our
Board.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
price of our stock on the date of grant and is amortized to
compensation expense over its vesting period, if achievement of
the performance measures is considered probable. At
June 30, 2006, there were 621,930 performance shares
outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be
distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is

This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.8 years. There were 87,888 performance shares
and performance share units that vested during fiscal 2006. The
weighted-average grant date price of the 244,600 performance
shares and performance share units granted during fiscal 2006
was $37.37.

In fiscal 2006, we issued an aggregate of 1,697,526 shares
under the terms of our stock incentive plans, which is net of
shares withheld for tax purposes.

Under our domestic retirement plans, most employees may select
an option to invest in Harris’ common stock at
70 percent of current market value limited to the lesser of
(a) one percent of their compensation and
(b) 20 percent of a participant’s total
contribution to the plan, which is matched by us. The discount
from fair market value on common stock purchased by employees
under the domestic retirement plans is charged to compensation
expense in the period of the related purchase.

NOTE 16:

NET INCOME PER SHARE

The computations of net income per diluted share are as follows:

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022.
Holders of the debentures have the right to convert each of
their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the
stated maturity of the debentures under any of the following
circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of our
    common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
    trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
    previous calendar quarter, is



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

more than 110 percent of the applicable conversion price
    per share of our common stock on such last trading day,

•

debentures called for redemption may be surrendered for
    conversion until the close of business on the business day
    immediately preceding the redemption date,

•

during any period that the long-term credit rating assigned to
    the debentures by either of Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
    or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group is at or below
    Ba1 or BB+, respectively, or if the debentures no longer are
    rated by either of these ratings services, or if the ratings for
    the debentures have been suspended by either of these ratings
    services, or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions,
    including if we make a significant distribution to holders of
    our common stock or if we are a party to specified
    consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all
    of our properties and assets.

After giving effect to the adjustment in connection with our
March 2005 stock split, a holder will receive
44.2404 shares of our common stock for each $1,000 of
debentures surrendered for conversion. This represents a
conversion price of $22.625 per share of our common stock.
Based upon satisfaction of the market price trigger as of the
end of the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2006, these
debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock
during the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2006.

The debentures will mature on August 15, 2022, unless
earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. We may redeem for
cash some or all of the debentures at any time on or after
August 18, 2007 at a price equal to 100 percent of the
principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed plus any
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Holders may
require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their
debentures on August 15, 2007, August 15, 2012 and
August 15, 2017 at a price equal to 100 percent of the
principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the purchase date.

We have assessed whether the embedded conversion feature within
our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022 should be
bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a
derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in
earnings under paragraph 12 of Statement 133. Based on
our assessment, we have determined that the conversion feature
is not required to be bifurcated under the provisions of
Statement 133; EITF Issue
No.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
expensed as incurred. These costs were $187.8 million in
fiscal 2006, $137.3 million in fiscal 2005 and
$111.3 million in fiscal 2004.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred
pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for
principally by the

percentage-of

-completion
method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require
us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined
performance or other specifications (such as designs).
Customer-sponsored research and development was
$626.0 million in fiscal 2006, $733.0 million in
fiscal 2005 and $729.9 million in fiscal 2004.
Customer-sponsored research and development is included in our
revenue and cost of product sales and services.

NOTE 18:

INTEREST EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $36.5 million in fiscal 2006,
$24.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $24.5 million in
fiscal 2004. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
major long-term projects can be capitalized as an additional
cost of the related asset. No interest was capitalized in fiscal
2006, fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. Interest paid was
$31.8 million in fiscal 2006, $23.2 million in fiscal
2005 and $23.6 million in fiscal 2004.

NOTE 19:

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to $30.6 million in fiscal
2006, $27.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $20.7 million
in fiscal 2004. Future minimum rental commitments under leases
with an initial lease term in excess of one



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

year, primarily for land and buildings, amounted to
approximately $103.3 million at June 30, 2006. These
commitments for the years following fiscal 2006 are: fiscal
2007 — $31.0 million; fiscal 2008 —
$24.4 million; fiscal 2009 — $16.9 million;
fiscal 2010 — $11.8 million; fiscal
2011 — $5.8 million; and $13.4 million
thereafter. These commitments do not contain any material rent
escalations, rent holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions,
leasehold improvement incentives or unusual provisions or
conditions. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception
of the lease or during the lease term are amortized over the
current lease term or estimated life, if shorter.

NOTE 20:

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

We use foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset
foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments
from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed
sales to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use
of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the
risks that arise from doing business in international markets.
At June 30, 2006, we had open foreign exchange contracts
with a notional amount of $45.7 million, of which
$15.7 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$30.0 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $73.3 million as of July 1, 2005, of which
$48.6 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$24.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
June 30, 2006, contract expiration dates range from less
than one month to 20 months with a weighted average
contract life of 3 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
exposures from cash flows anticipated in our RF Communications
segment related to three programs in the U.K. and one in Romania
and payments to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of
our government contracts in our Government Communications
Systems segment. We have hedged the forecasted cash flows
related to payments made to our U.S. operations to maintain
our anticipated profit margins. We also have hedged
U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
anticipated profit margins in our U.K. operations. As of
June 30, 2006, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
$0.2 million would be reclassified into net income from
comprehensive income within the next 20 months related to
these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No amounts were
recognized in our net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004
related to the component of the derivative instruments’
gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in our
net income in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 related to hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of
these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on the
balance sheet in accordance with Statement 133.

NOTE 22: INCOME TAXES

The provisions for income taxes are summarized as follows:

The components of deferred income tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory United States income tax rate
to the effective income tax rate follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

United States income taxes have not been provided on
$379.5 million of undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest these earnings
indefinitely. The determination of unrecognized deferred
U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and
credit carryforwards as of June 30, 2006 have expiration
dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
instances. The amount of domestic, international, and state and
local tax loss carryforwards as of June 30, 2006 was
$58.3 million, $224.5 million and $55.8 million,
respectively. The provision for income taxes includes benefits
attributable to the utilization of certain state net operating
loss and credit carryforwards of $6.5 million in fiscal
2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005. Pre-tax income (loss)
of international subsidiaries was $(9.9) million in fiscal
2006, $17.9 million in fiscal 2005 and $49.6 million
in fiscal 2004. Income taxes paid were $90.6 million in
fiscal 2006, $43.6 million in fiscal 2005 and
$52.7 million in fiscal 2004. The valuation allowance
increased $22.7 million from $47.7 million in fiscal
2005 to $70.4 million in fiscal 2006. $23.4 million of
the $70.4 million valuation allowance as of June 30,
2006, is attributable to acquired deferred tax assets, any
realization of which will be reflected as a change in goodwill.
The valuation allowance has been established for financial
reporting purposes, to offset certain domestic and foreign
deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding our ability to
realize them in the future.

NOTE 23: BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we serve and
operate in four business segments — Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications. Our Government
Communications Systems segment engages in advanced research and
develops, designs, produces and services advanced communication
and information processing systems, primarily for the DoD and
various other agencies of the U.S. Government. Our
RF Communications segment performs advanced research and
develops, designs, manufactures, sells and services secure
tactical radio products, primarily for the DoD and various
international defense agencies. Our Microwave Communications
segment designs, manufactures, sells and services microwave
radio products and develops, designs, produces, sells and
services network management systems, primarily for cellular
network providers and private network operators. Our Broadcast
Communications segment designs, manufactures, sells and services
television and radio transmission products; high-performance
video systems and products; software solutions related to
automation, asset management control and workflow; and broadcast
networking systems and products, primarily for radio and
television broadcasters as well as governmental agencies. Within
each of our business segments there are multiple program areas
and product lines that logically aggregate into our four
business segments described above. None of these program areas
or product lines warrant disclosure as a separate business
segment.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
Policies

. We evaluate each segment’s performance based
on its “operating income or loss,” which we define as
profit or loss from operations before income taxes excluding
interest income and expense, equity income and gains or losses
from securities and other investments. Intersegment sales are
transferred at cost to the buying segment and the sourcing
segment recognizes a normal profit that is eliminated. The
“Corporate eliminations” line item in the tables below
represents the elimination of intersegment sales and their
related profits. “Headquarters expense” represents the
portion of corporate expenses not allocated to the business
segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
States with international revenue derived primarily from
exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
exceeded 4 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2006,
fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all segments
(primarily our Government Communications Systems segment and our
RF Communications segment) as a percentage of total revenue were
66.2 percent in fiscal 2006, 65.7 percent in fiscal
2005 and 65.5 percent in fiscal 2004. Revenue from services
in fiscal 2006 was 33 percent, 6 percent,
16 percent and 18 percent of total revenue in our
Government Communications Systems, RF Communications,
Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications segments,
respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Selected information by business segment and geographical area

NOTE 24: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
of businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
related to: product liability; personal injury; patents,
trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products
containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or environmental
matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded
accruals for losses related to those matters that we consider to
be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred. While it is
not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
information, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at

SUBSEQUENT EVENT (UNAUDITED)

On September 5, 2006, we announced that we entered into a
definitive agreement with Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Stratex
Networks”), a publicly held provider of high-speed wireless
transmission systems, under which we will combine our Microwave
Communications Division with Stratex Networks to form a new
company named “Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.” Under
the terms of the agreement, we will contribute our Microwave
Communications Division and $25 million of cash in exchange
for approximately 56 percent ownership of the combined
company. Stratex Networks shareholders will exchange their
existing ownership of Stratex Networks for approximately
44 percent ownership of the combined company. The
transaction is subject to approval by Stratex Networks
shareholders, customary regulatory approvals, and other
customary closing conditions. Following the closing, it is
expected that Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. will be listed on
the NASDAQ Global Market. The transaction is expected to close
during the second or third quarter of our fiscal year 2007. The
financial results of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. will be
reflected in our consolidated financial statements, with
appropriate elimination of the minority interest not held by us.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Selected quarterly financial data is summarized below.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have classified investments in ARS as short-term investments.
Previously, such investments had been classified as cash and
cash equivalents due to their liquidity and pricing reset
feature. We have revised the classification to report these
securities as short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. We held ARS of $219.7 million, $133.4 million,
$56.6 million and $142.7 million for the quarters
ended October 1, 2004; September 30, 2005;
December 30, 2005; and March 31, 2006, respectively.
We held no ARS for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and
April 1, 2005. We also revised the presentation of the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to reflect the purchase and
sales of ARS as investing activities rather than a component of
cash and cash equivalents, which is consistent with the
presentation for fiscal 2006. In the previously reported
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the quarters ended
October 1, 2004; September 30, 2005; and
March 31, 2006 net cash used in investing activities
related to these short-term investments of $23.7 million,
$133.4 million and $86.1 million, respectively, was
included in cash and cash equivalents. In the previously
reported Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the quarters
ended December 31, 2004 and December 30, 2005 net
cash provided by investing activities related to these
short-term investments of $219.7 million and
$76.8 million, respectively, was included in cash and cash
equivalents.



ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
    AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls
and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls
and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily
is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have
investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not
control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures
with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially
more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries. As required by
Rule

13a-15

under
the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2006 we carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer. During fiscal 2006, we devoted
significant effort to comply with the rules on internal control
over financial reporting issued pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This effort expanded upon our
long-standing practice of acknowledging management’s
responsibility for the establishment and effective operation of
internal control through performing self-assessment and
monitoring procedures. Based upon this work and other evaluation
procedures, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that as
of the end of fiscal 2006 our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We periodically
review our internal control over financial reporting as part of
our efforts to ensure compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition,
we routinely review our system of internal control over
financial reporting to identify potential changes to our
processes and systems that may improve controls and increase
efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective
internal control environment. Changes may include such
activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating the activities of acquired business units,
migrating certain processes to our shared services
organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving
segregation of duties, and adding additional monitoring
controls. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we
incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired
business as part of our integration activities. There have been
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2006 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c)

Reporting.

Control Over Financial Reporting” is included within
