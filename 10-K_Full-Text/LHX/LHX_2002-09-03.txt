PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, along with our subsidiaries,
is an international communications equipment company focused on
providing product, system and service solutions for commercial
and government customers. Our five operating divisions serve
markets for government communications and information
processing, tactical radios, microwave, network support and
broadcast.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the
successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal
executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard,
Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is
(321) 727-9100. Our web site address is www.harris.com. The
information posted on our web site is not incorporated into this
Annual Report. Worldwide sales in fiscal 2002 were
$1.88 billion. On August 23, 2002, we employed about
9,700 people. We sell products in more than 90 countries.

During fiscal 2000, we completed our
repositioning as a company focused on communications and
communications equipment. During fiscal 2000, we
(1) completed the spin-off of our Lanier Worldwide, Inc.
office products subsidiary, (2) completed the sale of our
semiconductor business, and (3) exited from the telephone
switching and alarm management product lines. As a result of
these actions, our consolidated financial statements and notes
for fiscal 2000 and prior periods report the Lanier Worldwide,
Inc. and semiconductor businesses as discontinued operations
and, accordingly, prior periods have been restated.

General

We structure our operations around the following
five business segments:

Financial information with respect to all of our
other activities is reported as part of Headquarters Expense or
Non-Operating Income.



Each of our five business segments, which are
also referred to by us as “divisions,” has been
organized on the basis of specific communications markets. For
the most part, each operating segment has its own marketing,
engineering, manufacturing and product service and maintenance
organization. We produce most of the products we sell. Reference
is made to the note

Business Segments

in the Notes to
Financial Statements for further information with respect to our
business segments.

Our total revenues in fiscal 2002 were
approximately $1.88 billion compared to approximately
$1.96 billion a year earlier. Total sales in the United
States increased approximately 2 percent from a year
earlier while international sales, which amounted to
approximately 22 percent of our total from continuing
operations in fiscal 2002, decreased approximately
27 percent. Our net income for fiscal 2002 was
$82.6 million compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2001.

Description of Business by Segment

Government Communications
Systems

Our Government Communications Systems segment
conducts advanced research studies, develops prototypes and
designs, develops and produces state-of-the-art airborne,
spaceborne and terrestrial communications, information
processing equipment and systems for the U.S. Department of
Defense, FAA and other government agencies and also for other
large aerospace and defense companies serving the defense
industry. The Government Communications Systems segment
specializes in ground communications, aerospace communications

The Government Communications Systems segment is
a leading supplier of air-traffic control communication systems
and is also a major supplier of custom aircraft and spaceborne
communication and



information processing systems, cockpit digital
moving maps, controls and display processors, a leading supplier
of terrestrial and satellite communication systems, including
large deployable satellite antenna systems and flat panel,
phased-array and single-mission antennas and is a preeminent
supplier of super-high-frequency military satellite ground
terminals for the U.S. Department of Defense.

This segment is a major supplier of custom
ground-based systems and software designed to collect, store,

Major program milestones for the segment in
fiscal 2002 included:

In addition, in July of 2002, we were awarded a
15-year, $1.7 billion contract to integrate and modernize
the FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure. The total
contract amount of the program including options could reach
$3.5 billion through 2017. This program will consolidate
telecommunications at more than 5,000 FAA facilities nationwide,
while reducing operating costs, enhancing network security and
improving service.

In July 2002, we were also awarded a one-year,
$43 million contract to provide operations and maintenance
services for the U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network’s
communications functions at Schriever AFB, Colorado, and Onizuka
AFS, California. The contract contains options that could
increase the overall contract amount for us to $355 million
through 2009.

A significant portion of this segment’s
business involves classified programs. While classified projects
are not discussed in this Annual Report, the operating results
relating to classified projects are included in our consolidated
financial statements, and the business risks associated with
such projects do not differ materially from those of other
projects for the U.S. Government.



The Government Communications Systems segment is
expanding its capabilities and offerings in the government
services business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we
acquired Exigent International, Inc., a provider of professional
services and software support to government agencies for the
management of satellite command and control, telecommunications
and information technology programs.

We also concluded the sale of our minority
interest in two joint ventures with the General Electric
Company. We sold our interest in GE-Harris Railway Electronics,
LLC to General Electric in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and
concluded the sale of our interest in GE Harris Energy
Controls Systems, LLC to General Electric in the first quarter
of fiscal 2002.

In August 2001, we also completed the sale of 90
percent of our interest in our Harris Publishing Systems and
Baseview Products subsidiaries. The sale price was
$5.4 million. These subsidiaries had revenues of
approximately $21 million in fiscal 2001. We completed the
sale of our remaining 10 percent interest in these
subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for
$0.6 million to bring the total sales price to
$6.0 million.

Revenue in fiscal 2002 for this business segment
increased 9.0 percent to $924.4 million from
$848.3 million in fiscal 2001. Income before income taxes
increased 20.6 percent to $85.5 million.

This segment contributed 49 percent of our
total sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2002, 43
percent in fiscal 2001 and 45 percent in fiscal 2000.

Most of the sales of the Government
Communications Systems segment are made directly or indirectly
to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
containing standard government contract clauses providing for
redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
of the contractor. These sales consist of a variety of contracts
and programs with various governmental agencies, with no single
program accounting for 10 percent or more of our total
sales. In fiscal 2002, U.S. Government customers accounted for
approximately 94 percent of the segment’s total
revenues.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this
segment of our business was $426 million at July 26,
2002, compared with $405 million a year earlier.

The segment’s backlog includes both cost
reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement
contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price
contracts. Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts
and development contracts are generally cost reimbursement
contracts. Although a fixed-price contract generally enables us
to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less
than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that
increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or result in
losses on a contract. For fiscal 2002, 61 percent of the
revenues of this segment were generated from cost-reimbursement
contracts and 39 percent from fixed-price contracts.

For a discussion of certain risks affecting our
government business, see “Principal Customers,”
“Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

and as of June 29, 2001. Government Communication Systems
segment systems are produced principally in the
United States. International revenues are derived primarily
from exports.

Principal international manufacturing facilities
are located in Canada, China and the United Kingdom.
International marketing activities are conducted through
subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe,



Central and South America and Asia. We have also
established an international marketing organization and several
regional sales offices. Reference is made to Exhibit 21
“Subsidiaries of the Registrant” for further
information regarding our foreign subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including
dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the
marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both
domestically and internationally. These independent
representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit
orders from commercial or governmental customers for direct
sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances
may be recommended or established by the independent
representative and may be on a basis which is above or below our
list prices. These independent representatives generally receive
a discount from our list prices and may mark-up those prices in
setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. During the
2002 fiscal year, sales from indirect sales channels represented
8 percent of our total sales and 34 percent of our
international sales compared to sales from indirect sales
channels in fiscal year 2001 representing 9 percent of our
total sales and 27 percent of our international sales.

Fiscal year 2002 sales came from a large number
of foreign countries, no one of which accounted for
five percent or more of our total orders.

Certain of our exports are paid for by letters of
credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or
installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments or
other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often
cover most of the related costs incurred. Performance guarantees
by us are generally required on significant foreign government
contracts. In order to stay competitive in international
markets, we also enter into recourse and vendor financing to
facilitate sales to certain customers.

The particular economic, social and political
conditions for business conducted outside the United States
differ from those encountered by domestic businesses. Our
management believes that the overall business risk for the
international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that
faced by its domestic operations as a whole. A description of
the types of risks for which we are subject in international
business is contained in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
below.

Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management,
these risks are offset by the diversification of the
international business and the protection provided by letters of
credit and advance payments.

Except for inconsequential matters, such as
matters involving road and utility rights-of-way, we have never
been subjected to threat of government expropriation, either
within the United States or abroad.

Financial information regarding our domestic and
international operations is contained in the note

Business
Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive businesses that
are sensitive to technological advances. Although successful
product and systems development is not necessarily dependent on
substantial financial resources, some of our competitors in each
of our businesses are larger than we are, and can maintain
higher levels of expenditures for research and development. Our
competitors in the RF Communications, Microwave Communications,
Network Support and Broadcast Communications segments include
large multinational communications companies, as well as smaller
companies with developing technology expertise.

In the Microwave Communications segment our
existing and potential competitors include: Alcatel Networks,
Inc., DMC Stratex Networks, Inc., Ericsson Inc., Fujitsu
Compound Semiconductor, Inc., Marconi Corporation, Microwave
Networks Incorporated, NEC America (Radio Communications
Systems), Nera Telecommunications, Inc., Nokia Networks, P-Com,
Inc. and Siemens AG (Information and Communications Mobile) as
well as other companies which are in the development stage.
Several of our competitors are original equipment manufacturers
through which we distribute and sell products and services.



In the Broadcast Communications segment our
existing and potential competitors include: Broadcast
Electronics, Inc., Encoda Systems, Inc., Nautel Limited, NEC
Networks, Rhode & Schwarz GmbH, Tandberg Television ASA,
Thales Broadcast & Multimedia, as well as other private
companies and divisions of large companies.

In the Network Support segment our existing and
potential competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., TTI
Telecom International, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Turnstone
Systems, Inc., Spirent PLC, Teradyne, Inc., Tollgrade
Communications, Inc., Textron, Inc., Fluke (a subsidiary of
Danaher Corporation) and Sunrise Telecom, Incorporated as well
as numerous other small and larger companies.

Our competition in the Government Communications
Systems segment and the RF Communications segment, including for
U.S. Government contracts, typically are large, technically
competent firms with substantial assets.

We concentrate in each of our businesses on the
market opportunities which our management believes are
compatible with its resources, overall technological
capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in
these businesses are cost-effectiveness, product quality and
reliability, technological capabilities, service, ability to
meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of dealers in
international areas.

Principal Customers

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only
customer accounting for 10 percent or more of total sales,
were 54 percent, 42 percent and 41 percent of our
total sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
derived from contracts and agencies of, and prime contractors
to, the U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as
for default. Under contracts terminable at the convenience of
the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
Contracts which are terminable for default generally provide
that the U.S. Government only pays for the work it has accepted
and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.

Companies engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government are dependent on congressional
appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be
affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from
various military and political developments. In many cases,
there is also additional uncertainty relating to the complexity
of designs, necessity for design improvements, and difficulty in
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental
and highly sophisticated technical work. For further discussion
of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts see “Legal
Proceedings” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Backlog

Our funded backlog of unfilled orders was
approximately:

•

$888 million at July 26, 2002,

•

$775 million at July 27, 2001, and

•

$727 million at July 31, 2000.

The determination of backlog involves substantial
estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements
contracts and long-term contracts of a cost-reimbursement or
incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as the value of contract
awards received from the U.S. Government for which the U.S.
Government has appropriated funds and the appropriating agency
has given us authorization to spend these funds under the
contract, plus the amount of contract awards and orders received
from customers other than the U.S. Government, which have yet to
be recognized as sales. We



expect to record as sales during fiscal 2003 most
of our funded backlog as of July 26, 2002. However, there
can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become sales in
any particular period, if at all. Our funded backlog does not
include the full amount of our contract awards including those
pertaining to multi-year, cost-reimbursable contracts, which are
generally funded on an annual basis. Funded backlog also
excludes the sales amount of unexercised contract options that
may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the
sales amount of purchase orders that may be issued under
indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements.

Research, Development and
Engineering

Research, development and engineering
expenditures by us for our continuing operations totaled
approximately:

•

$516 million in fiscal 2002,

•

$486 million in fiscal 2001, and

•

$480 million in fiscal 2000.

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs for our continuing operations which included
research and development for commercial products and independent
research and development related to government products and
services were approximately:

•

$104 million in fiscal 2002,

•

$114 million in fiscal 2001, and

•

$100 million in fiscal 2000.

The portion of total research, development and
engineering expenditures not company-sponsored was funded by
government and commercial customers. Company-funded research is
directed to the development of new products and to building
technological capability in selected communications and
electronic systems areas. Government-funded research helps
strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities in areas of
interest. Almost all of our segments maintain their own
engineering and new product development departments, with
scientific assistance provided by advanced-technology
departments.

We currently employ about 4,000 engineers and
scientists and are making efforts to make the technologies
developed in any of our business segments available for all
other business segments.

Patents and Intellectual Property

We hold numerous patents which we consider, in
the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. However, we do
not consider our business or any business segment to be
materially dependent upon any single patent or any group of
related patents. We are engaged in a pro-active patent licensing
program, and have entered into a number of unilateral license
and cross-license agreements, many of which generate royalty
income. Although existing license agreements have generated
income in past years and will do so in the future, there can be
no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing
license agreements. With regard to patents relating to our
Government Communications Systems segment, the U.S. Government
often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize
others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant
to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our
use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.

Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with
our products are considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental and Other Regulations

Our manufacturing facilities, in common with
those of industry generally, are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly
with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe that we have
materially complied with these requirements and that such
compliance has not



had a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition. Expenditures to protect the environment and
to comply with current environmental laws and regulations over
the next several years are not expected to have a material
impact on our competitive or financial position. If future laws
and regulations contain more stringent requirements than
presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than
our present estimates of those expenditures.

Waste treatment facilities and pollution control
equipment have been installed by us to satisfy legal
requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and
prevention goals. No material amounts were spent by us on
environmental capital projects in each of fiscal 2002, 2001 or
fiscal 2000. A portion of our environmental expenditures relate
to discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
material in fiscal 2003. These amounts may increase in future
years.

Additional information regarding environmental
matters is set forth in “Legal Proceedings” and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and
services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our
facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw
materials needed for our operations and for our products. We are
dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
of components and the ability of our suppliers and
subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications
and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
of a particular item or because of domestic preference
requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. To
date, we have not been materially adversely affected by the
inability to obtain raw materials or products.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered
to be seasonal, although in recent years our revenues in the
second half of our fiscal year have generally exceeded revenues
in the first half.

Employees

As of June 28, 2002, we had approximately
9,700 employees, of whom approximately 8,700 were located
in the United States. Approximately 1,100 employees were
employed in the RF Communications segment, 1,200 in the
Microwave Communications segment, 200 in the Network Support
segment, 1,200 in the Broadcast Communications segment, and
5,400 in the Government Communications Systems segment, with the
remainder employed in headquarters or other support or service
functions.

None of our employees in the United States are
represented by a labor union; however, in certain international
subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers councils
or statutory labor unions.

In general, we believe that our relations with
our employees are good.

Additional Information

Additional information relating to our
businesses, including our operating segments, is set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations.”

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

We operate approximately 77 office and
manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
3.9 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
warehousing, engineering and office facilities that are owned
and about 1.1 million square feet of sales, office and
manufacturing facilities that are leased. The leased facilities
are for the most part occupied under leases for terms ranging
from one year to 30 years, a majority of which can be terminated
or renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at our option.
Our corporate



headquarters, which are owned by us, are located
in Melbourne, Florida. The location of our principal office and
manufacturing facilities, and the business segments which
utilize such facilities are as follows:

Government Communications Systems:

•  Malabar, Florida*

•  Melbourne, Florida*

•  Palm Bay, Florida*

RF Communications:

•  Rochester, New York*

Microwave Communications:

•  Redwood Shores, California

•  San Antonio, Texas*

•  Montreal, Canada

•  Shenzhen, China

Network Support:

•  Camarillo, California*

•  Melbourne, Florida*

Broadcast Communications:

•  Quincy, Illinois*

•  Sunnyvale, California

•  Littleton, Massachusetts

•  Cincinnati, Ohio*

•  Rennes, France

•  Huntingdon, United Kingdom

•  Rankweil, Austria

The locations identified by * are owned by us.

As of June 28, 2002, the following
facilities were in productive use by us in our operations:

In the opinion of management, our facilities are
suitable and adequate for their intended purposes and have
capacities adequate for current and projected needs. While we do
have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are not
considered significant. For more information about our lease
obligations, see the

“Lease Commitments”

footnote in the Notes to Financial Statements.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time
to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of business
in which we are engaged, various claims or charges are asserted
and litigation commenced against us arising from or related to:
product liability; patents, trademarks or trade secrets; labor
and employee disputes; the sale or use of products containing
asbestos; breach of warranty; antitrust; distribution; or
contractual relations. Claimed amounts may be substantial but
may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the
claim or the extent of any real risk of court awards. While it
is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
certainty, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
judgments, if any, which might be rendered against us in
existing litigation are reserved against, covered by insurance
or would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or our business taken as a whole.

Government Business.

Government contractors, such as us, engaged in supplying goods
and services to the U.S. Government and its various agencies are
dependent on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S.
Government policies. U.S. Government contracts typically involve
long lead times for design and development and are subject to
significant changes in contract scheduling and may be
unilaterally modified or cancelled by the government. Often
these contracts call for successful design and production of
complex and technologically advanced products or systems. We may
participate in supplying goods and services to the U.S.
Government as either a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to
a prime contractor. Disputes may arise between the prime
contractor and the government and the prime contractor and its
subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
contracting parties.

From time to time, we may either individually or
in conjunction with other U.S. Government contractors, be the
subject of U.S. Government investigations for alleged criminal
or civil violations of



procurement or other federal laws. These
investigations may be conducted without our knowledge. We are
unable to predict the outcome of such investigations or to
estimate the amounts of resulting claims or other actions that
could be instituted against us, our officers or employees. Under
present government procurement regulations, if indicted or
adjudged in violation of procurement or other federal civil laws
a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating
divisions, could be suspended or debarred from eligibility for
awards of new government contracts for up to three years. In
addition, a government contractor’s foreign export control
licenses could be suspended or revoked.

International.

As an
international company, we are, from time to time, the subject of
investigations relating to our international operations,
including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
laws. We are currently cooperating with certain government
representatives in investigations relating to potential
violations of foreign corrupt practices and other laws. Our
management does not believe that the outcome of these current
disputes or investigations will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or our business taken as a whole.

Environmental.

We
are subject to numerous Federal and state environmental laws and
regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time in
investigations or litigation of various potential environmental
issues concerning ongoing activities at our facilities or
remediation as a result of past activities. From time to time we
receive notices from the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and equivalent state environmental agencies that we are a
potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or
equivalent state legislation. Such notices assert potential
liability for cleanup costs at various sites, which include
sites owned by us, sites we previously owned and treatment or
disposal sites not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous
substances attributable to us from past operations. We have been
named as a PRP at 14 such sites, excluding sites as to which our
records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has
been finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our
management, any payments we may be required to make as a result
of currently existing claims will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or our business taken as a
whole.

In April 2002, 43 plaintiffs filed suit against
23 defendants, including us, in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs claim that
they suffered personal injuries and property damage due to the
disposal of nuclear materials and hazardous waste by defendants
in and near the Hicksville, Long Island, New York area. The
defendants are divided into two categories, the so-called
“Verizon defendants,” consisting of Verizon and its
predecessors who operated a facility known as the Sylvania
facility, at which the plaintiffs claim nuclear materials were
processed and disposed of, and the “non-Verizon
defendants,” consisting of all the other defendants,
including us, who the plaintiffs claim either caused or
permitted non-nuclear hazardous waste to be disposed of at their
facilities. The plaintiffs claim that the disposal of the
nuclear materials by the Verizon defendants and the disposal of
the non-nuclear hazardous wastes by the non-Verizon defendants
contaminated the groundwater utilized by the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs appear to be claiming damages from the defendants in
excess of $360 million. On July 22, 2002, the Court held a
preliminary conference at which the plaintiffs advised that
within 30 days they would be filing an amended complaint naming
perhaps as many as 87 additional defendants. Once the amended
complaint is filed, we will have 30 days to respond, and we
anticipate filing a motion to dismiss. An order will be sent
documenting future deadlines, and there is a hearing scheduled
on September 17, 2002 before the magistrate to address
discovery issues. We plan to defend this action vigorously. We
believe that the claimed damages do not bear a reasonable
relationship to our ultimate liability.

Additional information regarding environmental
matters is set forth in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS
TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted by us to a vote of our
security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.



EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT (As of
August 31, 2002).

Our executive officers are as follows:





There is no family relationship between any of
our executive officers or directors, and there are no
arrangements or understandings between any of our executive
officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any
of them was elected as an officer or director, other than
arrangements or understandings with our directors or officers
acting solely in their capacities as such.

All of our executive officers are elected
annually and serve at the pleasure of our board of directors.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY
    AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

Market Information

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS,” and
is also traded on the Boston, Chicago, Pacific and Philadelphia
Stock Exchanges and through the Intermarket Trading System.
According to the records of our transfer agent, as of
August 23, 2002, there were approximately
8,755 holders of record of our common stock.

The high and low sales prices as reported in the
consolidated transaction reporting system and the dividends paid
on our common stock for each quarterly period in the last two
fiscal years are reported below:

On August 23, 2002, the last sale price of
the our common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction
reporting system was $33.65 per share.

Dividends

On August 24, 2002, our board declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which will be paid
on September 20, 2002 to holders of record on
September 6, 2002. We have paid cash dividends every year
since 1941 and currently expect that cash dividends will
continue to be paid in the near future; however, there can be no
assurances that this will be the case. On August 24, 2002,
our board increased our annual dividend rate from $0.20 per
share to $0.32 per share. The declaration of dividends and the
amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our
financial condition, capital requirements, results of
operations, future business prospects and other factors that our
board of directors may deem relevant.

Repurchases

On October 22, 1999, our board authorized us
to repurchase up to 15 million shares of our common stock
periodically in the open-market, in negotiated or block
transactions or pursuant to tender offers. We did not repurchase
any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2002. During fiscal
2001, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million of our
shares in open-market transactions. In fiscal 2000, we
repurchased approximately 10.7 million of our shares in
open-market transactions (a portion of which was repurchased
under our board’s prior authorization). We have a remaining
authorization to purchase an additional 1.7 million shares
under our repurchase program.



Stock Split

On August 23, 1997, our board of directors
approved a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record at
the close of business on September 4, 1997. All share
information in this Annual Report for periods prior to such date
has been restated to reflect the stock split.

Sale of Securities

On August 26, 2002, we completed a private
placement offering of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
Salomon Smith Barney Inc., SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and
Wachovia Securities, Inc. acted as the initial purchasers of the
debentures. The debentures were offered and sold to the initial
purchasers in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In
connection with this offering and sale, we paid the initial
purchasers a commission equal to 2.5 percent of the
principal amount of the debentures.

The debentures will initially bear interest at an
annual rate of 3.5% per year, which will be reset on
August 15, 2007, August 15, 2012, and August 15,
2017, to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable
120 days prior to such reset date on 5-year U.S. Treasury
Notes. In no event, however, will the interest rate be reset
below 3.5% or above 5.5% per year.

Holders of the debentures will have the right to
convert each of their debentures into shares of our common stock
prior to the stated maturity under any of the following
circumstances:

(i)

during any calendar quarter if the closing sale
    price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the
    30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day
    of the previous calendar quarter, is more than 110 percent
    of the applicable conversion price per share of our common stock
    on such last trading day,

(ii)

debentures called for redemption may be
    surrendered for conversion until the close of business on the
    business day immediately preceding the redemption date,

(iii)

during any period that the long-term credit
    rating assigned to the debentures by either of Moody’s
    Investors Service Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Group is at or below Bal or BB+, respectively, or if the
    debentures no longer are rated by either of these ratings
    services, or if the ratings for the debentures has been
    suspended by either of these ratings services, or

(iv)

upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions, including if we make a significant distribution to
    holders of our common stock or if we are a party to specified
    consolidations, mergers, or transfers of all or substantially
    all of our properties and assets.

For each $1,000 of debentures surrendered for
conversion, a holder initially will receive 22.0994 shares of
our common stock. This represents an initial conversion price of
$45.25 per share of our common stock based on the issue price of
the debentures. The conversion rate may be adjusted for certain
reasons.

We may redeem the convertible debentures
commencing August 18, 2007 at a price equal to 100 percent
of the principal amount plus accrued interest, if any. Holders
may require us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in
part, on specified dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017 or upon the
occurrence of certain other events including a change of
control, at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal
amount plus accrued interest, if any.

ITEM  6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The following table summarizes our selected
historical financial information for each of the last five
fiscal years. All amounts presented have been restated on a
continuing operations basis. Discontinued operations and the
items discussed in the footnotes below are more fully discussed
in our Notes to Financial Statements. The selected financial
information shown below has been derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements. This table should be read in
conjunction with our other financial information, including
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of



Operations” and the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Annual Report.



ITEM  7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that management believes is useful in understanding
our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The
discussion is based on our continuing operations and should be
read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
Notes to Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual
Report. Except for the historical information contained here,
the discussions in this document contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed here.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed under
“Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
Future Results” below.

Application of Critical Accounting
Policies

In preparing our financial statements and
accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we
apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our Notes to
Financial Statements. We consider the policies discussed below
as critical to an understanding of our financial statements
because their application places the most significant demands on
our judgment, with financial reporting results relying on
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any
associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations are discussed throughout this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected
financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application
of these and other accounting policies, see the

“Significant Accounting Policies”

footnote in
our Notes to Financial Statements. Senior management has
discussed the development and selection of the critical
accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein
with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. Preparation
of this Annual Report requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts
    and Contract Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived
from long-term development and production contracts, which are
accounted for under the provisions of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position
No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP 81-1”). Revenues related to long-term
contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method
generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
to-date against estimated total contract costs at completion
(cost-to-cost) with consideration given for risk of performance
and estimated profit. The percentage-of-completion method of
revenue recognition is used in our Government Communications
Systems, RF Communications, Broadcast Communications and
Microwave Communications segments. Revenues are recorded on
certain long-term production contracts within our RF
Communications segment using the units of delivery method rather
than the cost-to-cost method. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items that may change the scope of a contract
are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated
and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award
fees applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is
sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally
are not recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally
are not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the
segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.

Recognition of profit on long-term contracts
requires estimates of: the contract value or total contract
revenue; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
progress towards completion. The estimated profit or loss on a
contract is equal to the difference between the estimated
contract value and the



estimated total cost at completion. Due to the
long-term nature of our programs, developing the estimated total
cost at completion often requires significant judgment. Factors
that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed
include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature
and complexity of the work to be performed, availability of
materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of delayed
performance, availability and timing of funding from the
customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
contract included in any estimate to complete. We review cost
performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing and
acquired contracts at least quarterly and in many cases more
frequently. If a change in estimated cost to complete a contract
is determined to have an impact on contract earnings, we will
record a positive or negative adjustment to estimated earnings
when identified. We record contracts acquired in connection with
a business combination at remaining contract value less our
estimate of costs to complete and a profit margin commensurate
with the profit margin we earn on similar contracts. Revisions
to cost estimates subsequent to the date of acquisition may be
recorded as an adjustment to goodwill or earnings, depending on
the nature and timing of the revision. A significant change in
an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect
on our statement of financial position and results of operations.

Provisions for Excess and Obsolete
Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or
market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and
record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. The review of excess and obsolete
inventory primarily relates to our Microwave Communications,
Broadcast Communications, Network Support and RF Communications
segments. Several factors may influence the sale and use of our
inventories, including our decisions to exit a product line,
technological change and new product development. These factors
could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory
quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future
product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may
have understated or overstated the provision required for excess
and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our
inventory was overvalued, we would be required to recognize such
costs in “Cost of product sales and services” in our
Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
determination. Likewise, if we determine that our inventory is
undervalued, we may have overstated “Cost of product sales
and services” in previous periods and would be required to
recognize such additional income. Therefore, although we make
every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts
of future product demand, including the impact of planned future
product launches, any significant unanticipated changes in
demand or technological developments could have a significant
impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating
results. We recorded $20.6 million, $10.5 million and
$25.1 million in inventory write-down charges for the
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In fiscal 2002
inventory write-downs are primarily due to the slow-down in
demand for our Microwave Communications segment’s products
as a result of weak international markets where a lack of
capital has radically reduced the expansion of telecom
infrastructure. The fiscal 2000 write-down includes a $14.1
million inventory write-down associated with the exit of our
telephone switching product line. At this time, management does
not believe that anticipated product launches would have a
material effect on the recovery of our existing net inventory
balances.

Accounts and Finance Receivables Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses

In our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments, a substantial majority of our revenues
and, consequently, our outstanding accounts receivables, are
directly or indirectly with the U.S. Government. Therefore, our
risk of not collecting amounts due us under such arrangements is
minimal. In our Microwave Communications, Broadcast
Communications and Network Support segments, our revenues are
supported by contractual arrangements specifying the timing and
amounts of payments. In addition, we often require letters of
credit or deposit payments prior to the commencement of work or
obtain progress payments from our customers upon the achievement
of certain milestones. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer
payment history and current creditworthiness, as determined by
our review of our customers’ current credit information. We
have also obtained credit insurance for some international
customers that we have determined to be a credit risk. We
continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers
and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon
our historical experience and any specific



customer collection issues that we have
identified. While such credit losses have historically been
within our expectations and the provisions established, we
cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same
credit loss rates that we have in the past. Measurement of such
losses requires consideration of historical loss experience,
including the need to adjust for current conditions, and
judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable
data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency
rates and financial health of specific customers. We
historically have experienced and expect to continue to
experience a minimal amount of uncollectible accounts
receivable. We recorded $6.0 million, $3.0 million and
$12.6 million in provisions for doubtful accounts for both
our accounts and finance receivables in our Consolidated
Statement of Income for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Valuation of Marketable Securities and
    Strategic Investments

Marketable securities and strategic investments
included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet are reflected in the
financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate
fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these
financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the
instrument. Where available, we use prices from independent
sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price
quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held
securities that do not have readily determinable fair values,
the determination of fair value requires management to estimate
the value of the securities based upon available information
such as projected cash flows and a review of the financial and
market conditions of the underlying company. In instances where
a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the
security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same
security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount
estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition, even where
the value of a security is derived from an independent market
price or broker or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be
required to determine the fair value. For instance, we generally
assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold
would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the
securities if we sell them and that any such sale would happen
in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be
incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could
be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate our
securities for “other than temporary” impairment.
Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment
security has been below the current value for an extended period
of time, which we generally define as six months. If an
“other than temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the investment
security recorded on the financial statements and our current
fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period
in which the impairment is determined. As of June 28, 2002,
we own approximately $52.2 million of marketable
securities, which have prices from independent sources such as
listed market prices and $89.7 million of strategic
investments, which are included in the “Other assets”
caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and which are valued
solely on our assumptions or estimates. In fiscal 2002
“Non-operating income” in our Consolidated Statement
of Income included a $10.0 million write-down of our
investment interest in Terion, Inc. and a $3.7 million
write-down of marketable securities for “other than
temporary” impairments.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible
Assets

We have made acquisitions in the past that
included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill and
other intangible assets. Under generally accepted accounting
principles in effect through June 29, 2001, these assets
were amortized over their estimated useful lives and were tested
periodically to determine if they were recoverable from
estimated future pre-tax cash flows on an undiscounted basis
over their useful lives. Effective in fiscal 2002, we
implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“Statement 142”). Under Statement 142,
goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual (or
under certain circumstances more frequent) impairment test based
on our estimated fair value. We completed impairment tests as of
June 30, 2001 and March 29, 2002 with no adjustment to
the carrying value of goodwill. Other intangible assets that
meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful
lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on
estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is typically less
than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because
fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future
cash flows. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying
the determination of an impairment loss. Goodwill in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2002 and
June 29, 2001 was $215.2 million and



$215.1 million, respectively. Other acquired
intangibles are included in the “Other assets” caption
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future changes in our
estimates or assumptions of fair value could result in the
recording of an impairment loss.

Business Considerations

Government and Defense
Industry:

Few developments have had a
profound effect on the defense and security environment of the
United States as much as the events of September 11, 2001.
In response to that tragedy, the United States has committed
itself to the War on Terrorism. Homeland security has become
central to this strategy. At the same time, the United States
and its allies have undertaken to transform military
capabilities from defending against threats posed by the former
Soviet Union to focus upon regional conflicts and proactive
threat identification. Such endeavors may require unilateral or
coordinated activities ranging from surveillance to engagement,
policing or peacekeeping. As a result of these trends and
technology developments, the United States and its allies are
placing more reliance on (i) sophisticated weapon systems
that provide long-range surveillance and intelligence,
(ii) battlefield management and precision strike expertise,
and (iii) the ability to quickly and efficiently deploy
complete defensive platforms globally. The Quadrennial Defense
Review, which focused on military changes of the future,
emphasized the need for advanced technology and government
electronics to meet the new and emerging threats, from
protecting the homeland against terrorism and missile attack, to
using information and communications as a distinct battle area
advantage, to protecting power globally by using intelligence
and long-range weaponry.

The budget for the U.S. Department of Defense for
fiscal 2003 and beyond reflects the above-mentioned
transformation of national defense policy and responds to
increased needs for homeland security and defeating terrorism.
Budget increases are projected for operational readiness and
personnel needs, as well as for procurement and for research and
development. Although the ultimate size of future defense
budgets remain uncertain, current indications are that the
defense budget will increase over the next several years.

Our management believes that our experience and
capabilities are well aligned with the United States’
defense priorities and initiatives. In addition, increased
emphasis on homeland defense may increase demand for usage of
our capabilities in areas such as imaging, intelligence and
surveillance, secure communications and information technology
systems.

While these developments have had a positive
impact on our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments, we remain subject to other risks
associated with U.S. Government business, including
technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations
and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks
which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Telecommunications
Industry:

The telecommunications
networking and equipment industry has experienced a very
challenging period in which business activity has changed
substantially. Service providers and Competitive Local Exchange
Carriers (“CLECs”) have experienced significantly
reduced revenue growth, significantly reduced access to capital
and the need to manage cash flow and profitability. In response
to these challenges, service providers have reduced capital
expenditures and are re-evaluating plans to expand
infrastructures and networks.

Prior to this slowdown, the telecommunications
and wireless networking and equipment industry was experiencing
significant growth. This growth and the markets were driven by
the demand for broadband access, high-speed data and fixed and
mobile cellular communications. Such demand was impacted by the
rapid build-out of telecommunications infrastructures in
developing regions, demand for Internet broadband access from
businesses and individuals, the evolution of private
communications networks and the availability of capital.

Our management believes that demand for wireless
telecommunications equipment and network support products will
eventually rebound and that our microwave products will be used
to continue infrastructure upgrades and build-outs. However, our
Microwave Communications and Network Support



segments currently remain subject to the general
economic slowdown and limited access to capital as well as the
other risks associated with these businesses, which are
discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Broadcast Industry:

The worldwide over-the-air broadcast
equipment industry is currently experiencing a transition from
analog to digital broadcasting. This transition is occurring
most rapidly for television broadcasting in the United States,
where the conversion to digital has been mandated at the
direction of Congress and under the management of the Federal
Communications Commission (“FCC”).

The new digital television technology allows
better-quality TV pictures, a significant increase in the amount
of TV programming available to consumers, and an array of new
services provided by broadcasters. In addition, moving to the
new system will free up the current broadcasting spectrum which
will be auctioned by the FCC for new commercial uses.

On November 8, 2001, the FCC and Congress
affirmed the 2006 deadline for the transition from analog to
digital television. Additionally, to encourage a larger number
of broadcasters to get up and running, the FCC is allowing
broadcasters to go on the air initially with a lower-power
signal to reduce their initial equipment requirements and
operating costs, and then to expand coverage throughout their
entire service area as the DTV transition progresses. Television
stations must provide, at a minimum, a digital signal during
prime time hours.

Also in support of its original schedule, the FCC
declined to issue blanket extensions for remaining DTV
construction deadlines (May 1, 2002 for commercial
stations, May 1, 2003 for non-commercial stations) and
followed the originally envisioned waiver process. The FCC
adopted a hard line approach to granting “waivers,”
which would allow broadcast stations to postpone their
transitions. The FCC denied or dismissed 136 waiver requests and
granted six-month extensions for 771. The FCC also set out
specific penalties for noncompliance.

The transition to digital television has moved
into full swing in the domestic broadcast industry. Currently,
more than 800 of the nation’s 1,600 commercial and public
broadcasters have ordered equipment that would allow them to
meet at least the minimum, first-step requirements of the
FCC’s mandated rollout schedule. Nearly 90 percent of
U.S. households now have access to at least one digital TV
signal and approximately 2 million high-definition
receivers have been sold in the U.S. On the content side,
approximately 50 percent of all major network (defined as
ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and PBS) prime-time programming is now
available in high-definition.

On August 8, 2002, the FCC adopted a plan
that required digital television tuners in nearly all new
television sets by 2007. By enacting a five-year rollout
schedule that starts with larger, more expensive TV sets, the
FCC believes that costs for equipment manufacturers and
consumers will be minimized. This action marks another step in
the FCC’s progress toward making the digital television
transition a reality.

It is also anticipated that domestic radio
broadcasters will soon begin the transition from analog to
digital technology. The proposed United States digital radio
standard, which has support of the radio broadcasting industry,
is awaiting approval from the FCC. It is expected that more than
50 percent of the American public should be able to receive
a digital radio signal by next spring. There are approximately
12,000 radio stations in the United States and the timing of the
domestic digital radio rollout will be market driven.

Internationally, the transition to digital
technologies, for both radio and television, is in various
stages of implementation. In general, digital television and
radio adoption has been slow across global markets, as there are
very few mandated conversion policies in the international
arena. Consequently, the international market remains an analog
market.

While the domestic digital television equipment
rollout has been robust, the economic downturn has slowed
advertising revenues and prompted some broadcasters to delay
purchases of automation and studio systems. Like the domestic
market, the international market has been similarly impacted.

The industry trend in both television and radio
toward consolidation and multiple-location operations is
continuing and should drive increased future demand for
automation, studio systems, network



management and services to manage the
consolidated facilities. Similarly, broadcasters’ desire to
find new nontraditional revenue streams such as datacasting
should also drive industry trends.

Our management believes that our experience and
capabilities are well aligned and poised to take advantage of
the industry trends noted above. While we believe that these
developments generally will have a positive impact on our
Broadcast Communications segment, we remain subject to general
economic conditions, which adversely impact the broadcasters, as
well as other risks associated with the broadcast industry,
including technological uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s
rollout of digital television, slower market adoption of digital
radio, and other risks which are discussed in this Annual Report.

Results of Operations

On November 5, 1999, we completed the
spin-off of our Lanier Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an
independent, publicly owned company. Additionally, on
August 13, 1999, we completed the sale of substantially all
of our semiconductor business. As a result of these actions, the
Lanier and semiconductor businesses are presented as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. Continuing
operations are reported under five segments: our Government
Communications Systems segment, RF Communications segment,
Microwave Communications segment, Network Support segment and
Broadcast Communications segment. The following discussion is on
a continuing operations basis.

Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal

Our revenue from product sales and services for
fiscal 2002 was $1,875.8 million, a decrease of
4.1 percent compared to fiscal 2001. Decreased revenues in
our Microwave Communications and Network Support segments were
partially offset by increased revenue in our Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments. Our income before income taxes in
fiscal 2002 was $125.1 million compared to
$72.4 million for the prior year. This increase was
primarily due to increased fiscal 2002 income before income
taxes in our Government Communications Systems, RF
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments when
compared to fiscal 2001; lower net interest expense in fiscal
2002 when compared to fiscal 2001; and the impact of the
$73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process research
and development related to the acquisition of WavTrace, Inc. in
fiscal 2001. Income before income taxes also increased due to
goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001 that was not evident in
fiscal 2002 pursuant to our implementation of
Statement 142, which requires goodwill to no longer be
amortized but rather tested for impairment on a periodic basis.
These increases in income before income taxes were partially
offset by greater losses before income taxes in our Network
Support segment in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001;
lower non-operating income in fiscal 2002 when compared to
fiscal 2001; and higher headquarters expense in fiscal 2002 when
compared to fiscal 2001. Additionally, our Microwave
Communications segment experienced a loss before income taxes of
$17.4 million in fiscal 2002 compared to income of
$14.7 million in fiscal 2001 after excluding the impact of
the above mentioned $73.5 million write-off of purchased
in-process research and development.



Revenue and Income Before Income Taxes by
    Segment

Our segment revenue and income before income
taxes are as follows:

(1)

Fiscal 2001 includes a $73.5 million
    write-off of purchased in-process research and development.

(2)

Fiscal 2002 includes a $10.3 million gain
    from the sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy
    Controls Systems, LLC joint venture, a $10.0 million
    write-down of our investment interest in Terion, Inc. and a
    $3.7 million write-down of marketable securities. Fiscal
    2001 includes a $33.4 million gain from the sale of our
    minority interest in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC
    joint venture and a $20.1 million write-down of marketable
    securities.

Government Communications Systems
Segment:

Government Communications
Systems segment revenue in fiscal 2002 increased
9.0 percent from fiscal 2001, and income before income
taxes in fiscal 2002 increased 20.6 percent from fiscal
2001. Growth in our Government Communications Systems segment
revenues underscores the general health of this business, which
continues to expand its customer base with significant new
contracts across all areas of airborne, spaceborne and ground
communications. The segment’s operating margin continues to
benefit from higher performance award fees as well as lower
operating costs due to the sale of our Harris Publishing Systems
and Baseview Products subsidiaries (“Publishing
Business”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.

In July 2002, our Government Communications
Systems segment won its largest contract ever — a
15-year, $1.7 billion contract to integrate and modernize
the FAA’s Telecommunications
Infrastructure (“FTI”). Total value of the
program including options could reach $3.5 billion through
2017. The FTI program will consolidate telecommunications at
more than 5,000 FAA facilities nationwide while reducing
operating costs, enhancing network security and improving
service and reliability. In the second



quarter we won a position on the Joint Strike
Fighter program, which we consider the second largest program
win in our history. We currently expect to provide more than
$2 billion in avionics work over the anticipated 20-year
life of the program.

Also in July 2002, our Government Communications
Systems segment was awarded a one-year, $43 million
contract to provide operations and maintenance services for the
U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network’s
(“AFSCN”) communications functions at Schriever AFB,
Colorado and Onizuka AFS, California. The contract contains
options that could increase the potential revenue to
$355 million by 2009.

In addition, our Government Communications
Systems segment was awarded an eight-year, $200 million
contract with the U.S. Census Bureau, a new customer for
us. The program will provide a computer database of all
addresses and locations where people live or work, covering an
estimated 115 million residences and 60 million
businesses in the United States. For fiscal 2002, the segment
booked firm orders for $950 million.

RF Communications
Segment:

RF Communications segment
revenue in fiscal 2002 increased 15.8 percent from fiscal
2001, and income before income taxes in fiscal 2002 increased
58.8 percent from fiscal 2001. This success is related in
great part to our ongoing support of the War on Terrorism with
our leading edge Falcon® II family of secure tactical
radios. Increases in income outpaced revenue growth as
manufacturing efficiencies, product cost reductions in our
Falcon® II family of products and favorable pricing
conditions were reflected in the operating results.

During the second quarter of 2002 our RF
Communications segment won a contract with potential revenues of
more than $200 million to supply high-frequency radios for
the United Kingdom’s Bowman Tactical Radio Programme, one
of the most important land-based military projects in recent
U.K. history. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002,
this segment won a key position on a program that the U.S.
Department of Defense calls its “Radio of the Future”
— the Joint Tactical Radio System (“JTRS”).
We were selected as part of a team to provide system design,
development and production for the first “cluster” of
a four-cluster development program that will provide advanced
radio communications for all U.S. military forces. RF
Communications also plans to bid on the JTRS Clusters 2-4,
which will be awarded over the next 12-24 months. The
remaining clusters have a total value of approximately
$5 billion.

Microwave Communications
Segment:

Microwave Communications
segment revenue in fiscal 2002 decreased 32.8 percent from
fiscal 2001, and the segment recognized a loss before income
taxes in fiscal 2002 of $17.4 million compared to a loss
before income taxes in fiscal 2001 of $58.8 million. In
fiscal 2001 our Microwave Communications segment’s results
include a $73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process
research and development. Without this write-off our Microwave
Communications segment had income before income taxes of
$14.7 million in fiscal 2001. Revenue and income are down
in this segment primarily as a result of weak international
markets where a lack of capital has radically reduced the
expansion of telecom infrastructure. The North American
microwave market remained healthy, driven by capacity upgrades
to accommodate increased cellular usage and the expansion of
cellular infrastructure to rural areas. We continue to maintain
our leading market position in North America, while aggressively
lowering costs to cope with the near-term market downturn in
international business.

Network Support
Segment:

Network Support segment
revenue in fiscal 2002 decreased 53.1 percent from fiscal
2001, and the segment recognized a loss before income taxes in
fiscal 2002 of $10.3 million compared to a loss before
income taxes in fiscal 2001 of $0.6 million. This segment
continues to suffer from the collapse of the DSL build-out and
weakened international markets. Cost reduction programs
implemented in this segment earlier in fiscal 2002 helped to
limit the losses of this segment in fiscal 2002.

Broadcast Communications
Segment:

Broadcast Communications
segment revenue in fiscal 2002 increased 5.5 percent from
fiscal 2001, and income before income taxes in fiscal 2002
increased 6.3 percent from the prior year. These increases
were largely a result of the continuing transition of
U.S. broadcasters to digital standards including medium to
small commercial TV stations as well as PBS stations that have
to meet their FCC mandated guidelines for the conversion from
analog to digital broadcasting. Sales



remained soft for automation and studio systems
as broadcasters continued to delay discretionary purchases in
response to low advertising revenues.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we acquired
the Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network
(“Hirschmann”) business, an Austria-based leader in
European-standard digital television and radio transmitters, for
$8.6 million.

Comparative Statement of
Income

Our comparative statement of income is as follows:

Gross Margin:

Our
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 26.5 percent in
fiscal 2002 compared to 26.8 percent in fiscal 2001, a
decrease of 0.3 percentage points. Both gross margin
improvement and higher sales volume in our RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments was offset mainly by lower
revenue and lower gross margin in our Network Support segment
due to the collapse of the DSL build-out and weakened
international market. The improved gross margin in our RF
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments came from
product cost reductions, improved manufacturing processes and
efficiencies gained on higher sales volume and favorable pricing
conditions. Our Government Communications Systems segment gross
margin was also slightly lower than the prior year due to the
August 2001 sale of our Publishing Business, which had high
margins. Additionally, the lower sales volume due to depressed
international markets in our Microwave Communications segment in
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 negatively impacted our
gross margin in fiscal 2002.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative
Expenses:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses declined from $414.4 million in
fiscal 2001 to $400.2 million in fiscal 2002. As a
percentage of revenue, it remained relatively flat at
21.2 percent of revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to
21.3 percent of revenue in fiscal 2002. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses were significantly lower in
our Government Communications Systems segment due to the August
2001 sale of our Publishing Business. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were also significantly lower in our
Network Support and Microwave Communications segments due to
cost-cutting actions in response to international market
weakness in the microwave radio market and general market
weakness for our network support products. Engineering, selling
and administrative expenses would have declined even more in our
Microwave Communications segment had it not been for planned
one-time costs associated with the cost-cutting actions, which
included a facility closing and headcount reductions in several
locations. The reductions in



engineering, selling and administrative expenses
were partially offset by increased headquarters expense as well
as increases in engineering, selling and administrative expenses
in our Broadcast Communications segment due to our acquisition
of Hirschmann and in our RF Communications segment to
support substantially higher sales volume. The increase in
headquarters expenses was associated with idle facility costs
and higher expenses from our supplemental executive retirement
plan, which fluctuates as a function of the U.S. stock
market.

Overall company-sponsored research and product
development costs were $103.9 million in fiscal 2002 versus
$113.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease was primarily
due to a slow-down of spending in our Microwave Communications
segment in correlation with the market delay in demand for our
pending new product introductions such as our broadband wireless
access products.

Customer-sponsored research and development,
which does not impact engineering, selling and administrative
expenses, increased from $372.5 million in fiscal 2001 to
$412.3 million in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the
U.S. Government continuing significant new spending for the
War on Terrorism.

Goodwill
Amortization:

In June 2001, the FASB
issued Statement 142. Under Statement 142, goodwill
and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized
but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets
that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be
amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). We
applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
Thus, there was no goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002 compared
to $22.2 million in fiscal 2001.

Non-Operating Income:

Our non-operating income decreased
from $80.0 million in fiscal 2001 to $41.0 million in
fiscal 2002. Non-operating income in fiscal 2001 includes a
$33.4 million gain from the sale of our minority interest
in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture and a
$20.1 million write-down of marketable securities.
Non-operating income in fiscal 2002 includes a
$10.3 million gain from the sale of our minority interest
in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC joint
venture, a $10.0 million write-down of our investment
interest in Terion, Inc. and a $3.7 million write-down of
marketable securities. Non-operating income also decreased as a
result of gains from the sale of securities available for sale,
decreasing from $102.5 million in fiscal 2001 to
$64.2 million in fiscal 2002, and higher legal expenses
incurred in our offensive patent infringement pursuits. The
gains from the sale of securities available for sale in both
years result primarily from the sale of shares in Intersil
Corporation, which were acquired in August 1999 in connection
with the sale of our semiconductor operations. Partially
offsetting these decreases was $7.3 million income from our
equity investments in fiscal 2002 compared to a loss from equity
investments of $9.5 million in fiscal 2001. As of
June 28, 2002, we only have one remaining investment that
we account for under the equity method of accounting, which is
our minority position in LiveTV, LLC. Investments made in
marketing and technology projects and other items reduced
non-operating income by $22.8 million in fiscal 2002 and
$26.2 million in fiscal 2001.

Interest Income and Interest Expense:

Our interest income was unchanged at
$13.3 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001. Our interest expense
decreased from $34.8 million in fiscal 2001 to
$26.7 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to a
$110.5 million reduction of total debt from
$419.4 million at June 29, 2001 to $308.9 million
at June 28, 2002.

Income Taxes:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was
70.4 percent in fiscal 2001 versus 34.0 percent in
fiscal 2002. The high rate in fiscal 2001 was a result of the
non-deductibility of the write-off of purchased in-process
research and development resulting from our WavTrace
acquisition. Excluding the impact of the write-off of purchased
in-process research and development, the provision for income
taxes as a percentage of pretax income was 35.0 percent in
fiscal 2001. In both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, the impact of
export sales reduced our total tax rate below the statutory
rate, including state income taxes. Fiscal 2002 also benefited
from the favorable resolution of certain outstanding state tax
liabilities, for which we had previously provided. The tax
impact of foreign source income and losses increased our tax
rates in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 also benefited



from stock sales that had a higher tax basis than
the basis used in calculating gains for financial accounting
purposes. Non-deductible goodwill amortization increased our tax
rate in fiscal 2001.

Return on Revenue:

Our net income as a percentage of
revenue increased from 1.1 percent in fiscal 2001 to
4.4 percent in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due
to the reasons previously discussed.

Selected financial information relating to
geographical regions and export sales is set forth in the note

Business Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2001 Compared with Fiscal

Our net revenue for fiscal 2001 was
$1,955.1 million, an increase of 8.2 percent compared
to fiscal 2000. Increased revenues in our Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments were
partially offset by decreased revenue in our Network Support
segment. Our income before income taxes in fiscal 2001 was
$72.4 million versus $38.5 million for the prior year.
This increase was primarily due to increased fiscal 2001 income
before income taxes in our Government Communications Systems,
RF Communications and Broadcast Communications segments
when compared to fiscal 2000, as well as lower fiscal 2001
losses before income taxes in our Network Support segment and
higher fiscal 2001 non-operating income when compared to fiscal
2000. These income improvements were partially offset by the
$73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process research
and development related to the acquisition of WavTrace, Inc. in
fiscal 2001, higher fiscal 2001 headquarters expense and higher
fiscal 2001 goodwill amortizations when compared to fiscal 2000
as well as net interest expense in fiscal 2001 versus net
interest income in fiscal 2000.

Revenue and Income Before Income Taxes by
Segment

Our segment revenue and income before income
taxes are as follows:



(1)

Fiscal 2001 includes a $73.5 million
    write-off of purchased in-process research and development.

(2)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $41.0 million
    restructuring expense.

(3)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $10.7 million
    write-off of purchased in-process research and development.

(4)

Fiscal 2001 includes a $33.4 million gain
    from the sale of our minority interest in our GE-Harris Railway
    Electronics, LLC joint venture and a $20.1 million
    write-down of marketable securities.

Government Communications Systems
Segment:

Government Communications
Systems segment revenue in fiscal 2001 increased
4.0 percent from the prior year and income before income
taxes increased 22.0 percent as we had outstanding
technical and management performance on defense and other
government contracts that resulted in favorable award fees.
Backlog continued to build, reflecting a continued stream of
significant contract wins and increased defense spending by the
Federal government.

During the fourth quarter, we concluded our
acquisition of Exigent International, Inc.
(“Exigent”), a provider of software and services for
satellite command and control, telecommunications and
information technology.

RF Communications
Segment:

The revenue from this segment
increased 1.2 percent in fiscal 2001 versus record revenue
levels in fiscal 2000. This business continues to benefit from
the market’s enthusiasm for our Falcon® II high
data rate, multiband, secure radios that were introduced in
fiscal 2000 to meet the growing bandwidth requirement in the
networked digital on-the-move battlefield being embraced by
military groups in both the United States and internationally.
Income before income taxes increased from $27.3 million in
fiscal 2000 to $32.5 million in fiscal 2001 as this segment
experienced higher margins on our Falcon® II products.

Microwave Communications
Segment:

Revenues from this segment
increased 39.0 percent during fiscal 2001 as worldwide
market demand strengthened in North America and demand remained
high for digital microwave radios used in cellular, PCS and
private telecom infrastructure systems. We are a leading
provider of point-to-point microwave products and our
Megastar™ and Constellation™ family of products
exhibited strong customer acceptance. The segment’s results
for fiscal 2001 included a $73.5 million write-off of
purchased in-process research and development related to the
acquisition of WavTrace. Excluding this write-off, the
segment’s income before income taxes increased from
$9.1 million in fiscal 2000 to $14.7 million in fiscal
2001. The increase was primarily due to the higher sales volume.

In August 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WavTrace, a developer of broadband wireless access
(“BWA”) systems for high-speed wireless access to the
Internet and other data, voice and video services. Our microwave
communications business invested in BWA technology during the
year on our ClearBurst™ GB product. In addition, we planned
further cost reduction actions in our Microwave Communications
segment to improve margins and to better position the business
for the expected resumption in market growth. These actions,
which were taken in fiscal 2002, included a facility closing and
headcount reductions in several locations and will result in a
one-time charge of approximately $10.0 million in fiscal
2002.

Network Support
Segment:

Revenue from this segment
decreased 42.3 percent in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000. The segment’s fiscal 2000 results included the impact
of our exited telephone switching and alarm management product
lines, including a $41.0 million restructuring expense.
Excluding the impact of these exited product lines, revenues for
the segment decreased 11.7 percent in fiscal 2001 versus
fiscal 2000 and loss before income taxes was $0.6 million
in fiscal 2001 versus income before taxes of $21.3 million
in fiscal 2000. The reduction of income was due to lower sales
volume and margins related to the segment’s line test
products. This segment was impacted by the abrupt slowdown in
the domestic DSL services market. We have taken actions to
reduce costs in the line test business and began to concentrate
more on our core business of tools and test sets and network
management products.

Broadcast Communications
Segment:

The segment reported a
30.7 percent increase in revenues as the transition from
analog to digital technology and the sale of digital television
transmitters gained pace during fiscal 2001. This acceleration
was boosted in part by positive rulings from the FCC affirming
the mandated transition to digital technology. Our Broadcast
Communications segment also became a leading



supplier of automation solutions in the U.S. with
the help of the Louth acquisition made in fiscal 2000. The
segment’s results for fiscal 2000 included a
$10.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research
and development related to the acquisition of Louth. Excluding
this write-off, the segment’s income before income taxes
increased from $18.6 million in fiscal 2000 to
$35.0 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily
due to higher sales volume and higher margins from our
automation and digital television products.

Following the close of fiscal 2001, we acquired
the Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network business, an
Austria-based leader in European-standard digital television and
radio transmitters and digital cable systems with annual sales
of approximately $26 million.

Comparative Statement of
    Income

Our comparative statement of income is as follows:

Gross Margin:

Our
gross margin as a percent of revenue was 26.8 percent in
fiscal 2001 compared to 25.2 percent in fiscal 2000. The
fiscal 2000 gross margin was impacted by a $12.0 million
write-down of inventory and lower gross margins related to our
Network Support segment’s telephone switching product line
that was exited in fiscal 2000. Excluding the impact of this
exited product line, gross margin as a percent of revenue was
26.2 percent in fiscal 2000. The increase from
26.2 percent gross margin in fiscal 2000 to
26.8 percent gross margin in fiscal 2001 is primarily due
to improved gross margins in our Broadcast Communications, RF
Communications and Government Communications Systems segments.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative
Expenses:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were
21.2 percent in fiscal 2001 versus 22.4 percent in
fiscal 2000. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses in
fiscal 2000 were impacted by $16.5 million of transition
costs associated with exiting the telephone switching product
line and by administrative and general, marketing and sales and
research and development expenses in the telephone switching
product line in the first half of fiscal 2000. Excluding the
impact of the exited product line, engineering, selling and
administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were
20.6 percent in fiscal 2000. The increase from
20.6 percent in fiscal 2000 to 21.2 percent in fiscal
2001 was due primarily to increased spending in research and
development related to our Microwave Communications
segment’s ClearBurst

TM

GB microwave radio
product in fiscal 2001.



Goodwill
Amortization:

Our goodwill
amortization increased from $10.5 million in fiscal 2000 to
$22.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was due to the
WavTrace acquisition made in fiscal 2001 and the Louth and TRT
Lucent Technologies acquisitions made during the second half of
fiscal 2000. Intangibles resulting from acquisitions are being
amortized by the straight-line method principally over 8 to
15 years. In establishing the amortization period of
intangibles resulting from acquisitions, we considered such
factors as future expected cash flows, technological life spans,
customer relationships and distribution channels. We continue to
monitor these factors and we believe that no material portion of
our intangibles resulting from acquisitions will dissipate over
a shorter period than the amortization period being used.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement 142.
Under Statement 142, goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for
impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to
have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives (but with no maximum life). We will apply the new
rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Application of
the nonamortization provisions of Statement 142 is expected
to result in an increase in net income of $15.6 million
($0.24 per diluted share) per year. During fiscal 2002, we will
perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill
and indefinite lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2001,
and we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests
will be on our operations or financial position.

Non-Operating Income:

Our non-operating income increased
from $48.2 million in fiscal 2000 to $80.0 million in
fiscal 2001. Non-operating income in fiscal 2001 includes a
$33.4 million gain from the sale of our minority interest
in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture that is
partially offset by a $20.1 million write-down of
marketable securities available for sale due to a decline in
market value. The remaining increase in non-operating income is
primarily a result of gains from the sale of shares in Intersil
Corporation, which were acquired in August 1999 in connection
with the sale of our semiconductor operations. These gains were
partially offset by investments made in marketing and technology
products and lower levels of royalty income in fiscal 2001 when
compared to the prior year.

Interest Income and Interest Expense:

Our interest income decreased from
$27.4 million in fiscal 2000 to $13.3 million in
fiscal 2001 due to reduced cash balances that resulted from cash
paid for acquired businesses and the purchase of common stock
for treasury during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001. Our interest
expense increased from $25.2 million in 2000 to
$34.8 million in fiscal 2001 due to an allocation of
interest expense to the results of discontinued operation in
fiscal 2000. Total interest expense from both continuing and
discontinued operations in fiscal 2000 was $41.7 million
versus $34.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease was due
to a reduction of total debt from $491.0 million at
June 30, 2000 to $419.4 million at June 29, 2001.

Income Taxes:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was
70.4 percent in fiscal 2001 versus 35.0 percent in the
prior year. The increase is a result of the non-deductibility of
the write-off of purchased in-process research and development.
Excluding the impact of the write-off of purchased in-process
research and development the provision for income taxes, as a
percentage of pretax income was 35.0 percent in fiscal
2001. Both fiscal 2001 and 2000 benefited from tax rates on
foreign source income and export sales, which offset the
additional provision needed for state income taxes. Fiscal 2001
also benefited from stock sales that had a higher tax basis than
the basis used in calculating gains for financial accounting
purposes.

Return on Revenue:

Our income from continuing operations,
as a percentage of revenue was 1.1 percent in fiscal 2001
versus 1.4 percent in fiscal 2000. The reduction was
primarily due to the reasons previously discussed.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities:

Our net cash provided by
operating activities was $206.6 million in fiscal 2002
compared to net cash used in operating activities of
$27.3 million in fiscal 2001. The improvement in cash flows
from operating activities is due primarily to improved cash
flows related to unbilled costs, inventories and accounts and
notes receivable. During fiscal 2002, working capital reduction
programs in all of our segments as well as sales volume
decreases in our Network Support and



Microwave Communications segments led to
decreases in inventories and accounts and notes receivable. This
improvement was partially offset by a reduction in cash flows as
a result of lower accounts payable on lower volumes in fiscal
2002. The increase in unbilled costs, inventories and notes
receivable in fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from our Broadcast
Communications and Microwave Communications segments’ sales
volume increases.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities:

Our net cash provided by
investing activities was $29.3 million in fiscal 2002
compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$59.6 million in fiscal 2001. Cash provided by investing
activities in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the proceeds from
the sale of securities available for sale of $69.1 million
and the $23.0 million of proceeds from the sale of our
minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC
joint venture. The increase in cash flows from investing
activities in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001 is due
primarily to $147.6 million cash paid for acquisitions in
fiscal 2001 versus $9.4 million in fiscal 2002;
$34.2 million cash paid for strategic investments in fiscal
2001 versus $7.5 million in fiscal 2002; and the
$23.0 million of proceeds from the sale of our minority
interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC joint
venture in fiscal 2002. These increases were partially offset by
a $58.3 million decrease in the proceeds from the sale of
securities available for sale and the $50.0 million of
proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in our GE-Harris
Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture in fiscal 2001.

Our additions of plant and equipment in fiscal
2002 were $45.9 million compared to $55.2 million in
fiscal 2001 with no single large items accounting for the
reduction. Our total additions in fiscal 2003 are expected to be
in the $75 million to $80 million range.

Net cash used in financing
activities:

Our net cash used in
financing activities decreased from $187.3 million in
fiscal 2001 to $114.3 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease
is attributable to our use of $92.2 million to repurchase
shares of our common stock during fiscal 2001. Also the proceeds
from the sale of common stock increased $7.5 million, which
was offset by a $110.5 million decrease in debt in fiscal
2002 versus an $83.7 million decrease in debt in fiscal
2001.

In fiscal 2000, our board of directors approved a
share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up
to 15 million shares through open market transactions, in
negotiated block transactions or pursuant to tender offers. In
fiscal 2001, we used $92.2 million to repurchase
3.2 million shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2002, we
did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. An
authorization to repurchase an additional 1.7 million
shares under this repurchase program still exists. At this time
it has not been determined whether or not we will repurchase any
of our stock under the remaining authorization within the next
twelve months.

Free Cash Flow:

We
use “free cash flow” as a measure of performance. The
calculation of free cash flow begins with net cash provided by
(used in) operating activities from the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. This amount is then decreased by additions of
plant and equipment and increased by proceeds from the sales of
securities available for sale. Free cash flow was a positive
$229.8 million in fiscal 2002, which is comparable to a
positive $44.9 million in fiscal 2001.

Capital Structure and
Resources:

We have available committed
syndicated credit facilities with various banks that currently
provide for borrowings up to $325.5 million. The credit
facilities consist of a $212.5 million 3-Year Credit
Agreement, which expires in May of 2004 and a $113 million
364-Day Credit Agreement that expires in May of 2003.
Customarily we have extended our 364-Day Credit Agreement when
it expires and currently have no reason to believe we will not
again extend it when it expires. Interest rates on borrowings
under these facilities and related fees are determined by a
pricing matrix based upon our long-term debt rating assigned by
Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s
Investors Service. The availability of these facilities is not
contingent upon our debt rating. We are not required to maintain
compensating balances in connection with these agreements. At
June 28, 2002 no amounts were borrowed under these
facilities, however, availability of borrowings under these
facilities is required for us to be eligible to issue commercial
paper. The financial covenants contained in these facilities
include, among others, maintenance of consolidated tangible net
worth of not less than $777 million (which amount was
initially $700 million and is subject to further increase),
maintenance of a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio of not



more than 3.0 and a limit on total debt to
$800 million. These credit facilities also include negative
covenants (i) limiting the creation of liens or other
encumbrances, (ii) limiting certain sale and leaseback
transactions, and (iii) limiting certain sales or other
dispositions of assets other than in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, these facilities include certain
provisions for acceleration of maturity in the case of a
(a) “cross default” with other indebtedness in an
amount in excess of $25 million, (b) final uninsured
judgment in excess of $25 million which remains unpaid or
discharged, or (c) change of control, including if a person
or group of persons acquires more than 25 percent of our
voting stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit
aggregating $79.2 million from various domestic and
international banks, of which $54.6 million was available
on June 28, 2002. These lines provide for borrowings at
various rates and typically may be terminated upon notice and
are reviewed annually for renewal or modification. We have a
short-term commercial paper program in place, which we may
utilize during the year to satisfy short-term cash requirements.
There were no borrowings under the commercial paper program at
June 28, 2002.

We also have an effective shelf registration
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
provides for the issuance of debt securities of up to
$500 million. We also have outstanding unsecured long-term
debt of $250 million which we issued in public offerings in
the mid-1990s and which have final maturities in excess of
20 years.

At June 28, 2002 we had contractual cash
obligations to repay debt (including capital lease obligations,
which are immaterial) and to make payments under operating
leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as
follows:

We have entered into surety bonds, standby letter
of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial
institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee
of future performance on certain contracts to provide products
and services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with
our insurance carriers.



At June 28, 2002 we had commitments related
to contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit,
guarantees and other arrangements, as follows:

We have guaranteed up to $19.6 million in
borrowings of LiveTV, LLC, a joint venture in which we hold a 49
percent ownership of the voting interest. The amount of LiveTV,
LLC borrowings outstanding as of June 28, 2002 for which we
were guarantor was approximately $16.8 million. This amount
is included in the amounts related to guarantees above. Our
investment in LiveTV, LLC is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. At June 28, 2002, our investment in
LiveTV, LLC had no cost basis.

In fiscal 2002, we issued 523,219 shares of
common stock to employees under the terms of our option and
incentive plans.

We use the intrinsic-value method of accounting
for stock option awards granted to employees. If we
prospectively adopted the fair value method of accounting for
these options in fiscal 2003, we estimate that the impact on our
diluted earnings per common share would be $0.03.

Management currently believes that existing cash,
funds generated from operations, sales of marketable securities,
the credit facilities and access to the public and private debt
markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated
requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases, if any, under the current repurchase program for
the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB” by
Standard and Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by
Moody’s Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating
ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios
sufficient for retention of these debt ratings. There are no
assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in the
future; however, our ratings have been recently affirmed by
these agencies. If our credit rating is lowered below
“investment grade” then we may not be able to issue
short-term commercial paper, but would instead need to borrow
under our other credit facilities or look for other
alternatives. As of June 28, 2002, we had no commercial
paper outstanding.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. The debentures are unsecured obligations
convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial
conversion price of $45.25 per share, subject to adjustment. The
debentures were issued at 100 percent of the principal
amount, less a discount of 2.5 percent to the initial
purchasers. We may redeem the debentures commencing August 2007
at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued
interest. Holders may require us to repurchase the debentures,
in whole or in part, on specified dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017
or upon the occurrence of certain other events at
100 percent of the principal amount



plus accrued interest. The debentures initially
bear interest at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. The
interest rate will be reset in August 2007, 2012, and 2017, but
in no event will it be reset below 3.5 percent or above
5.5 percent per annum. More information regarding the terms
of the debentures can be found in the related Indenture, dated
August 26, 2002 incorporated by reference as an exhibit to
this Annual Report.

Comparative Financial
    Position:

Our comparative financial position is as follows:

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

Our cash increased in
fiscal 2002 due primarily to cash provided by operating
activities as well as cash receipts related to the sale of our
minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems,
LLC joint venture of $23.0 million and the proceeds from
the sale of securities available for sale of $69.1 million.
These increases were partially offset by a $110.5 million
reduction in debt, $45.9 million additions of plant and
equipment, $13.2 million cash dividends paid and
$9.4 million cash paid for acquired businesses, which
included the acquisition of Hirschmann Multimedia Communications
Network.

Marketable
Securities:

Our marketable securities
decreased from $146.8 million as of June 29, 2001 to
$52.2 million as of June 28, 2002. The decrease was
primarily due to our sale of a portion of our holdings in
Intersil Corporation and a reduction in the quoted market price
of Intersil Corporation stock.

Working Capital:

Our
working capital decreased 4.4 percent from
$761.7 million as of June 29, 2001 to
$727.9 million as of June 28, 2002. The
$33.8 million decrease was due primarily to decreases in
marketable securities, receivables and inventories, which were
partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents and a
reduction of current liabilities.

Goodwill:

Our
goodwill increased slightly from $215.1 million as of
June 29, 2001 to $215.2 million as of June 28,
2002. The increase was due primarily to goodwill recorded as a
result of the acquisition of Hirschmann Multimedia
Communications Network. This increase was partially offset by
the write-off of goodwill associated with our minority interest
in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC joint
venture, which was sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
In determining the amount of the purchase price allocated to
intangibles from acquisitions, we use established valuation
techniques used in the communications technology industry, which
include present value calculations of future cash flows.

Non-Current Deferred Income Tax
Asset:

Our asset related to
non-current deferred income taxes was $19.5 million as of
June 29, 2001 versus a $26.0 million as of
June 28, 2002. The increase is primarily due to the
reduction of non-current deferred tax liabilities arising from
accruals.

Total Debt and
Capitalization:

Our total debt
decreased from $419.4 million as of June 29, 2001,
representing 27.3 percent of total capital (defined as the
sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity) to
$308.9 million as of June 28, 2002, representing
21.2 percent of total capital.



Restructuring

In fiscal 2000, we recorded a $41.0 million
charge ($26.7 million after income tax) for the
restructuring of our operations. Restructuring actions included
a reduction of approximately 161 employees and provisions for
the write-down of intangible assets, equipment and other assets
associated with the exit from our Network Support segment’s
telephone switching and alarm management product lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161
switching business employees were notified that their employment
would be terminated and what their specific severance benefit
would be. These employees worked in the marketing, sales,
manufacturing and administrative areas and were primarily
located in Marin County, California. As of September 29,
2000, the employment of all 161 employees had been terminated.

In June of 2000, we sold the core switch business
to Teltronics, Inc. and in August of 2000, we sold the alarm
management product line. We also sold the international
activities of these product lines during fiscal 2001. Estimated
discounted cash flows were used in determining the fair value of
assets and liabilities in recording the restructuring charge.

We completed the payment of all severance
benefits during the second quarter of fiscal 2001. No further
cash outlays from these restructuring actions are expected.

Sales from these product lines were none in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and $73.5 million in fiscal
2000. The loss before income taxes from these product lines were
none in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and $18.9 million in
fiscal 2000.

Purchased In-Process Research and
Development

WavTrace

In August 2000, we purchased WavTrace, a
developer of broadband microwave radio systems for high-speed
wireless access to the Internet and other data, voice and video
services. Prior to the acquisition, we owned slightly less than
20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase price for the
remaining approximately 80 percent is valued at
$144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as follows:

This business is being operated within our
Microwave Communications segment.

In connection with the acquisition, we allocated
$73.5 million of the purchase price to an in-process
research and development project. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the
development of this project had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal
2001.

In making the purchase price allocation to
in-process research and development, we relied on present value
calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments
and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution
and project risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process
research and development were associated with one significant
research project for which technological feasibility had not
been established. This project was for the development of the
ClearBurst™ GB product (formerly known as the PM 2000).



ClearBurst™ GB is a point-to-multipoint
microwave radio system that is a wireless broadband option to
deliver the Internet and other multimedia services at speeds up
to 180 Mbp/s per user. The ClearBurst™ GB with BigBurst
airlink will use adaptive time division duplexing
(“TDD”), which is expected to allow for
100 percent efficient use of the available spectrum.
ClearBurst™ GB will also use dynamic asymmetry to adjust
for the different data traffic levels of small and large
customers. The technology allocates bandwidth between the uplink
and downlink of a frequency channel to accommodate traffic. As a
result, adaptive TDD is expected to provide greater efficiency
than predecessor technologies and support 15 times more
customers than previous technologies. The estimated stage of
completion of the ClearBurst™ GB project at the time of the
acquisition was 80 percent (considering time-based,
cost-based and milestone-based completion measures).
ClearBurst™ GB does not have any significant leverage on
any existing technology developed outside of this project.

The value assigned to purchased in-process
research and development was determined by estimating the costs
to develop the purchased in-process research and development
into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash
flows to their present value using a discount rate of
35 percent.

Remaining development efforts for this in-process
research and development project include various phases of
design, development and testing. The anticipated completion date
for the in-process research and development project will occur
during fiscal 2003, after which we expect to begin generating
economic benefits from the technology over a seven-year life
cycle. Expenditures to complete this project did not have a
material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

These estimates are subject to change, given the
uncertainties of the development process, and no assurance can
be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur. We
expect to continue these development efforts and believe we have
a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and
development programs. However, there is a risk associated with
the completion of the project and there is no assurance that the
project will attain either technological or commercial success.

Louth

In January 2000, we purchased Louth, a leading
supplier of advanced automation systems for radio and television
broadcasters. We paid cash in the net amount of approximately
$90 million.

In connection with the acquisition, we allocated
$10.7 million of the purchase price to in-process research
and development projects. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the
development of these projects had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the third quarter of fiscal
2000.

This business is being operated within our
Broadcast Communications segment.

In making the purchase price allocation to
in-process research and development, we relied on present value
calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments
and completion costs, and an assessment of overall contribution
and project risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process
research and development were determined by identifying
significant research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established. The fair values assigned
to each of the significant projects and the stage of completion
are reported below:



A discussion of the most significant project
follows:

Version 9.5
of the Automated Device Controller (“ADC”)
Software:

•

Base ADC product is an all-purpose
    program/commercial automation system with the ability to
    integrate a wide variety of broadcast devices.

•

Version 9.5 provides a link between traffic,
    engineering and on-air broadcasting operations.

•

The primary functions under development include:

•

The development of Version 9.5 was initiated in
    early calendar 1998 (conceptualization of features, etc.).

•

The amount of completion was estimated at
    80 percent (considering time-based, cost-based and
    milestone-based completion measures).

•

Version 9.5 incorporates significant leverage on
    existing technology from ADC version 9.4. The degree of leverage
    was estimated to be 50 percent.

The value assigned to purchased in-process
research and development was determined by estimating the costs
to develop the purchased in-process research and development
into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash
flows to their present value using a discount rate of
28 percent.

Remaining development efforts for these
in-process research and development projects included various
phases of design, development and testing. The completion of the
in-process research and development projects occurred within
twelve months of acquisition. We are currently generating
economic benefits from the technologies and expect to generate
them over a seven-year life cycle. Expenditures to complete
these projects did not have a material impact on our results of
operations or cash flows.

Retirement Plans

Retirement benefits for substantially all of our
employees are provided primarily through a retirement plan
having profit sharing and savings elements. We also provide
limited health-care benefits to retirees who have 10 or more
years of service. All of our obligations under our retirement
plans have been fully funded by our contributions, the provision
for which totaled $46.1 million in fiscal 2002.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 56 percent of our
international business is transacted in local currency
environments. The impact of translating the assets and
liabilities of these operations to U.S. dollars is included as a
component of shareholders’ equity. At June 28, 2002,
the cumulative translation adjustment reduced shareholders’
equity by $22.8 million compared to a reduction of
$28.5 million at June 29, 2001.

We utilize foreign currency hedging instruments
to minimize the currency risk of international transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did
not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2002, 2001
or 2000.



Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently
followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the
impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for
employees and the cost of purchased materials and services.

Market Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates, fluctuations in the market value of our equity securities
available for sale and changes in interest rates. We employ
established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and
Currency:

We
use foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance
sheet and future foreign currency commitments. Generally, these
foreign exchange contracts offset foreign currency denominated
inventory and purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts
receivable from and future committed sales to customers and
intercompany loans. We believe the use of foreign currency
financial instruments should reduce the risks, which arise from
doing business in international markets. At June 28, 2002, we
had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
$83.5 million, of which $44.8 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $38.7 million were classified as
fair value hedges. This compares to total foreign exchange
contracts with a notional amount of $43.0 million as of
June 29, 2001, of which $6.3 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $36.7 million were classified as
fair value hedges. At June 28, 2002 contract expiration
dates range from less than one month to three years with a
weighted average contract life of 0.5 years.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the United
Kingdom Bowman Programme in our RF Communications segment. This
contract for our tactical radio products was awarded in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer
pays in Pounds Sterling (“GBP”). We also have payments
to local suppliers in GBP on this program. We have hedged the
forecasted sales and vendor payments denominated in GBP to
maintain our anticipated profit margin in U.S. dollars. As of
June 28, 2002, we estimated that a pretax loss of
$1.8 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next three years related to
these transactions. The net gain or loss included in our
earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001 representing the amount of fair
value and cash flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was
$0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. No
amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001
related to the component of the derivatives instruments’
gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in our
earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001 related to hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of
these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on the
balance sheet in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”).

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of
our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of
sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
derivatives held at June 28, 2002 would have an impact of
approximately $7.8 million on the fair value of such
instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
commitments.

Marketable Securities:

We also currently have a portfolio of
marketable equity securities available for sale. These
investments result from the retained interest in sold or
spun-off businesses and the investment into start-up companies
that have technology or products that are of interest to us. The
fair market value of these securities at June 28, 2002 was
$52.2 million compared to $146.8 million at
June 29, 2001. This decrease was due primarily to the sale
of some of these investments in fiscal 2002 and a decrease in
these securities’ quoted market prices. The corresponding
unrealized gain is included as a component of shareholders’
equity. These investments historically have had higher
volatility than most



market indices. A 10 percent adverse change
in the quoted market price of marketable equity securities would
have an impact of approximately $5.2 million on the fair
market value of these securities.

We utilize option contracts in the form of
cashless collars to hedge anticipated cash flows from the sale
of marketable securities. Contracts are generally one year or
less. At June 28, 2002, we had open option contracts for
175,000 shares of Intersil Corporation stock at a weighted
average strike price of $32.26, which compares to 850,000 shares
at a weighted average strike price of $32.35 as of June 29,
2001. All of these collars were classified as cash flow hedges
and recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet in
accordance with Statement 133. The fair market value of
these collars reflected in the caption “Other assets”
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 28, 2002 was
$1.9 million. The fair market value of these collars
reflected in the caption “Other accrued items” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2001 was
$1.8 million.

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of
our hedging programs for marketable securities include accuracy
of cash flow estimates, volatility of security markets and the
cost and availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent
adverse change in the quoted market price of marketable equity
securities would have an impact of approximately
$0.4 million on the fair value of such instruments.

Interest Rates:

We
utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both
fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage our exposures to
changes in interest rates. We do not expect changes in interest
rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in
fiscal 2003, although there can be no assurances that interest
rates will not change significantly.

Environmental Matters

We are actively engaged in complying with
environmental protection laws. In addition to ongoing internal
compliance programs, an immaterial amount was spent on
environmental capital projects in fiscal 2002 and 2001. We
estimate that we will authorize an immaterial amount in fiscal
2003 for environmental-related capital projects. Under the
Superfund Act or similar state environmental laws, we also have
potential liability at various waste sites designated for clean
up. We are named as a PRP at 14 such sites where future
liabilities could exist. These sites include two sites owned by
us, eight sites associated with our former graphics or
semiconductor locations, four of which were sold to Intersil
Corporation, and four treatment or disposal sites not owned by
us that contain hazardous substances allegedly attributable to
us from past operations. We routinely assess our contingencies,
obligations and commitments to clean up and monitor sites in
light of in-depth studies, analysis by environmental experts and
legal reviews. At the two sites we own and at six sites
associated with our former locations, we are involved primarily
in monitoring and remediation programs that have been
implemented in cooperation with various environmental agencies.
At one of the sites associated with our former locations, we
have provided indemnification to the purchaser for potential
undiscovered future liabilities, and at another we have provided
indemnification to the purchaser for liabilities for which we,
in turn, have been indemnified by a prior owner. At the other
sites, we are involved as one of numerous PRPs.

In ascertaining environmental exposures, we must
assess the extent of contamination, the nature of remedial
actions, continually evolving governmental standards and the
number, participation level and financial viability of other
PRPs and other similar variables. Based upon internal and
third-party studies, as well as the remediation and monitoring
expense history at the two sites we own and at five sites
associated with our former locations, the number and solvency of
PRPs at the other sites and an assessment of other relevant
factors, we have estimated that our discounted liability under
the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent
discount rate, is approximately $5.7 million. This
liability is accrued in the June 28, 2002 Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that
will be incurred over the next 20 to 25 years (depending on
the number of years for each site) is approximately
$8.9 million. The expected payments for the next five years
are: fiscal 2003 — $1.8 million; fiscal
2004 — $0.8 million; fiscal 2005 —
$0.6 million; fiscal 2006 — $0.6 million;
fiscal 2007 — $0.4 million; and the aggregate
amount thereafter is approximately $4.7 million.



Outlook

Our government-related businesses had an
outstanding year in fiscal 2002. Our selection for key programs
by the FAA, the Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of Defense,
and the U.K. Ministry of Defence represent a wonderful tribute
to our employees, the quality of our technology, products,
programs and services, and our ability to build long-term
relationships with valued customers. Clearly, it was a rewarding
year in which our customers expressed great confidence in us.
Our Broadcast Communications segment had an outstanding year
with record sales and income. We have provided in excess of
60 percent of the transmission equipment to U.S. TV
broadcasters who have already complied with requirements for new
digital standards. We intend to continue to lead the digital
transition in TV and radio, in the United States and around the
world. Our diversified mix of businesses is allowing us to
overcome the current downturn in telecommunications.

Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that
May Affect Future Results

This Annual Report contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as
assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect,
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
statements reflect management’s current expectations,
assumptions and estimates of future performance and economic
conditions. Such statements are made in reliance upon the safe
harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The following are some of the factors we believe
could cause our actual results to differ materially from
expected and historical results. Other factors besides those
listed here could also adversely affect us.

We currently are experiencing uncertain
economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
in our markets and, as a result, future income and
expenditures.

Current conditions in the domestic and global
economies are extremely uncertain. As a result, it is difficult
to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole. It
is even more difficult to estimate growth in various parts of
the economy, including some of the markets in which we
participate. Because all components of our budgeting and
forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
markets we serve, the prevailing economic uncertainty renders
estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult
than usual. As a result, we may make significant investments and
expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits, which
could affect adversely our results of operations. The future
direction of the overall domestic and global economies will have
a significant impact on our overall performance.

The severe telecommunications slowdown has
had a negative impact on our telecom businesses and continued
weakness could further hurt our operations.

During the past year there has been a severe
downturn and tightening of capital markets for the
telecommunication, cellular and wireless telephone industry in
general. Additionally, the CLEC business has experienced a
severe downturn and many CLECs have ceased operations or have
scaled back operations significantly. This slowdown has had an
adverse impact upon our network support and microwave businesses
and continued weakness may have an adverse impact on the
development of the market for our broadband wireless access
products.

We depend on the U.S. Government for a
significant portion of our sales, and the loss of this
relationship or a shift in government funding could have adverse
consequences on our business.

Approximately 54 percent of our net sales in
fiscal 2002 were to the U.S. Government. Therefore, any
significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with
the U.S. Government could significantly reduce our
revenues. Our U.S. Government programs must compete with
programs managed by other defense contractors for a limited
number of programs and for uncertain levels of funding. Our
competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their
business relationships with the U.S. Government and likely
will continue these efforts in the future. The
U.S. Government may choose to use other defense contractors
for its limited number of defense programs. In addition, the
funding of defense programs also competes with nondefense
spending of the U.S. Government. Budget decisions made by
the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have
long-term consequences for our business. A shift in



government defense spending to other programs in
which we are not involved, or a reduction in
U.S. Government defense spending generally, could have
adverse consequences on our business.

We derive a significant portion of our
revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks
of doing business in foreign countries including fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

In fiscal 2002, revenues from products exported
from the U.S. or manufactured abroad were 22 percent
of our total sales. Approximately 56 percent of our
international business in fiscal 2002 was transacted in local
currency environments. Losses resulting from currency rate
fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that
international sales will continue to account for a significant
portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks
of doing business internationally, including:

While these factors or the impact of these
factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could
adversely affect our operations in the future.

The fair values of our portfolio of passive
investments are subject to significant price volatility or
erosion.

We maintain portfolio holdings of various issuers
and types of securities. These securities generally are
classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded
on our balance sheet at fair value. Part of our portfolio
includes minority equity investments in several publicly-traded
companies. Because the majority of these securities represent
investments in technology companies, the fair market values of
these securities are subject to significant price volatility
and, in general, suffered a significant decline during fiscal
2002. In addition, the realizable value of these securities is
subject to market and other conditions. We also have invested in
numerous privately held companies, many of which still can be
considered in the start-up or developmental stages. These
investments are illiquid and are inherently risky as the markets
for the technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose our entire investment in these companies.

Our future success will depend on our
ability to develop new products that achieve market
acceptance.

Both our commercial and defense businesses are
characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving
industry standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends
on a number of factors, including our ability to:

We believe that, in order to remain competitive
in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products,
which will require the investment of significant financial
resources in new product development. The need to make these
expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other
projects, and we



cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately
will lead to the timely development of new products. Due to the
design complexity of some of our products, we may experience
delays in completing development and introducing new products in
the future. Any delays could result in increased costs of
development or redirect resources from other projects. In
addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our
products, especially our broadband wireless access products,
will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our
products to gain market acceptance could reduce significantly
our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be
sure that our competitors will not develop competing products
that gain market acceptance in advance of our products or that
our competitors may develop new products that cause our existing
products to become obsolete. If we fail in our new product
development efforts or our products fail to achieve market
acceptance more rapidly than those of our competitors, our
revenues will decline and our business, financial condition and
results of operations will be adversely affected.

We cannot predict the consequences of
future terrorist activities, but they may affect adversely the
markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against
risks, our operations or our profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on
September 11, 2001, as well as the U.S.-led response and
the potential for future terrorist activities, have created
economic and political uncertainties that could have a material
adverse effect on our business and the prices of our securities.
These matters have caused uncertainty in the world’s
financial and insurance markets and may increase significantly
the political, economic and social instability in the geographic
areas in which we operate. These matters also have caused the
premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase and may
cause some coverages to be unavailable altogether. While our
government businesses have benefitted from the War on Terrorism
these developments may affect adversely our business and
profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we
cannot predict at this time.

We have made, and may continue to make,
strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make,
strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include:

We depend significantly on our government
contracts, which are only partially funded, subject to immediate
termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a government program may be
implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
and subcontracts. The funding of government programs in the
United States is subject to Congressional appropriations.
Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection
with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds
on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for
several years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial
funding initially, and additional funds are committed only as
Congress makes further appropriations. The termination of
funding for a government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenues attributable to that



program. That could have an adverse impact on our
operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the
failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has
been started could result in lost revenue.

Generally, government contracts are subject to
oversight audits by government representatives. In addition, the
contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination,
in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
government’s convenience upon the payment of compensation
only for work done and commitments made at the time of
termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
government contracts will not be terminated under these
circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be
able to procure new government contracts to offset the revenues
lost as a result of any termination of our government contracts.
Because a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on
our procurement, performance and payment under our government
contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have an
adverse impact on our financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to
specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic
and other requirements. These requirements, although customary
in government contracts, increase our performance and compliance
costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby
reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations
and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, from
government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
Among the causes for debarment are violations of various
statutes, including those related to procurement integrity,
export control, government security regulations, employment
practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records
and recording of costs. The termination of a government contract
or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an
adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse
effect on our reputation and ability to procure other government
contracts in the future. We currently are cooperating with
certain government representatives in investigations relating to
potential violations of foreign corrupt practices, export
controls and other laws. No assurance can be given that the
outcome of these investigations will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or our business as a whole.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that
could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost
overruns.

Sometimes, we enter into contracts on a firm,
fixed-price basis. During fiscal 2002 approximately 33 percent
of our total Government Communications Systems and
RF Communications segments’ sales were from
fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost
savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns
since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial estimates
are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Government
contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the
government can compel us to complete a project or, in certain
circumstances, pay the entire cost of its replacement by another
provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost
overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many
of these projects involve new technologies and applications and
can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological
difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials,
problems with other contractors and cost overruns, can result in
the contractual price becoming less favorable or even
unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet
project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
results.

Third parties have claimed in the past and
may claim in the future that we are infringing their
intellectual property, and we could suffer significant
litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling
products.

Third parties have claimed in the past and may
claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual
property rights, and we may be found to infringe those
intellectual property rights. While we do not believe that any
of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights
of third parties, we may



be unaware of intellectual property rights of
others that may cover some of our technology, products and
services.

Any litigation regarding patents or other
intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and
could divert our management and key personnel from our business
operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the
uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these
risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also
require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.
Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license
agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be
subject to significant damages or injunctions against
development and sale of certain of our products.

We often rely on licenses of intellectual
property useful for our businesses. We cannot assure you that
these licenses will be available in the future on favorable
terms or at all.

Third parties may infringe our intellectual
property, and we may expend significant resources enforcing our
rights or suffer competitive injury.

Our success depends in large part on our
proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality
provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our
intellectual property rights, our competitive position could
suffer, which could harm our financial condition.

Our pending patent and trademark registration
applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge
the validity or scope of these patents or trademark
registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a
significant competitive advantage.

We may be required to spend significant resources
to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may
not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position
may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may
design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited
in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for
competitors to capture market share.

The outcome of litigation in which we have
been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse
decision in any such matter could have a material adverse affect
on our financial position and results of
operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation
matters. These claims may divert financial and management
resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our
operations. Although we believe that we have meritorious
defenses to the claims made in each and all of the litigation
matters to which we have been named a party, and intend to
contest each lawsuit vigorously, no assurances can be given that
the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse
resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material
adverse affect on our financial position.

We are subject to customer demand for
financing and customer credit risk.

The competitive environment in which we operate
historically has required us, and many of our principal
competitors, to provide medium-term and long-term customer
financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success
for some of our businesses may be dependent, in part, upon our
ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms.
While we generally have been able to place a portion of our
customer financings with third-party lenders or to otherwise
insure a portion of this risk, a portion of these financings is
provided directly by us. There can be higher risks associated
with some of these financings, particularly when provided to
start-up operations such as local network providers, to
customers in developing countries or to customers in specific
financing-intensive areas of the telecommunications industry. If
customers fail to meet their obligations, losses could be
incurred and such losses could have an adverse effect on us. Our
losses could be much greater if it becomes more difficult to
place or insure against these risks with third



parties. This also may put us at a competitive
disadvantage to competitors with greater financial resources. We
have various programs in place to monitor and mitigate customer
credit risk; however, we cannot assure you that such measures
will be effective in reducing our exposure to our
customers’ credit risk. Continued weakness in the general
economy, and the telecommunications industry in particular, may
result in increased defaults by customers and increased losses.

We operate in highly competitive
businesses.

We operate in highly competitive businesses that
are sensitive to technological advances. Although successful
product and systems development is not dependent necessarily on
substantial financial resources, some of our competitors in each
of our businesses are larger and can maintain higher levels of
expenditures for research and development than we can. Our
competitors in our commercial communications businesses include
large multinational communications companies, as well as smaller
companies with developing technology expertise. Our competitors
for U.S. Government contracts typically are large,
technically competent firms with substantial assets. We
concentrate in each of our businesses on the market
opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources,
overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal
competitive factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness,
product quality and reliability, technological capabilities,
service, ability to meet delivery schedules and the
effectiveness of dealers in international areas. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against
our current or future competitors or that the competitive
pressures that we face will not result in reduced revenues and
market share.

We depend on the recruitment and retention
of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain
such personnel could affect adversely our
business.

Due to the specialized nature of some of our
businesses, our future performance is dependent upon the
continued services of our executive officers and key engineering
personnel. Our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and
retain qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales
and management personnel for our operations. Competition for
personnel, particularly people with key technology skills, is
intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining
qualified personnel. Our failure to successfully compete for
these personnel or the cost of competing for these personnel
could seriously harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

The forward-looking statements contained in this
report are made as of the date hereof and we disclaim any
intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements or to update the reasons why actual results could
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise.

ITEM  7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
    MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates, fluctuations in the market value of our marketable equity
securities available for sale, and changes in interest rates. We
employ established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. For
a discussion of such policies and procedures and the related
risks, see “Market Risk Management” in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation,” which is incorporated
by reference into this Item 7A.

HARRIS CORPORATION

MELBOURNE, FLORIDA



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To Harris Directors and
Shareholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries as of
June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001 and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and comprehensive
income and shareholders’ equity for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended June 28, 2002. Our audits
also include the financial statement schedule listed in the
index Item 15(a). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Harris Corporation and
subsidiaries at June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
June 28, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth herein.

As discussed in Significant Accounting Policies
and Accounting Changes notes to the consolidated financial
statements, in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002, the
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation —

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.
As used in these notes, the terms “Harris”,
“we,” “our” and “us” refer to
Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. These
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and require
management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Significant intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year —

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday
nearest June 30. Fiscal Years 2002, 2001 and 2000 include
52 weeks.

Cash Equivalents —

Cash equivalents are temporary cash
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. These investments include accrued interest and are
carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable equity securities are
stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, included as a separate component of shareholders’
equity. Realized gains and losses from marketable securities are
determined using the specific identification method. The cost
basis of marketable securities was $31.8 million at
June 28, 2002 and $40.3 million at June 29, 2001.
The proceeds from the sale of marketable securities were
$69.1 million in fiscal 2002, $127.4 million in fiscal
2001 and $52.6 million in fiscal 2000. The amount of
realized gains included in “Non-operating income” was
$60.5 million in fiscal 2002, $82.4 million in fiscal
2001 and $49.6 million in fiscal 2000. Included in these
realized gains were write-downs for other than temporary
decreases in the market value of $3.7 million in fiscal
2002 and $20.1 million in fiscal 2001.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments —

The carrying
amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, cost method
investments, receivables, notes receivables, and short-term and
long-term debt approximate their fair values. Fair values are
based primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
instruments. A discussion of fair values for our derivative
financial instruments are included under the caption
“Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this
Significant Accounting Policies note.

Inventories —

Inventories are priced at the lower of
cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out methods) or
market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and
record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements.

Plant and Equipment —

Plant and equipment are carried on the
basis of cost. Depreciation of buildings, machinery and
equipment is computed by the straight-line and accelerated
methods. The estimated useful lives of buildings range between 5
and 50 years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and
equipment range between 3 and 10 years.

Income Taxes —

We follow the liability method of
accounting for income taxes.

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible
Assets —

Goodwill represents
the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of
the net assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“Statement 142”),
indefinite-life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are
not amortized. We periodically review our identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill, considering factors such as
projected cash flows and revenue and earnings multiples, to
determine whether the value of the assets are impaired and the
amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is impaired,
the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the
financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as
an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. We
have defined our reporting units to be the same as our business
segments. For identifiable intangible assets with indefinite
lives, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

cash flows. See the “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” footnote for additional information
regarding intangible assets and goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Identifiable Intangible Assets —

We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of
undiscounted cash flows from such assets. If the sum of the
expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the
carrying amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount.

Revenue Recognition

Our segments have the following revenue
recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
segment:

Revenue in our Government
Communications Systems segment primarily relates to long-term
contracts. Revenue and anticipated profits under long-term
contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis,
generally using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where
sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs
incurred to estimated total costs at completion. Contracts are
combined when specific aggregation criteria stated in the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s
Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts” (“SOP 81-1”) are met. Criteria
generally include closely interrelated activities performed for
a single customer within the same economic environment.
Contracts generally are not segmented. If contracts are
segmented, they meet the segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.
Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered
in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, are
generally not recognized until the event occurs. When
adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

RF Communications
segment:

Revenue in our RF
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above except that our
RF Communications segment sometimes uses the units of
delivery method of accounting rather than the cost-to-cost
method of accounting for production contracts that call for the
delivery of larger quantities of products. Under the units of
delivery method, sales and profits are recorded based on the
ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total units to be
delivered under the contract. Unearned income on service
contracts is amortized by the straight-line method over the term
of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue when
contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied.

Microwave Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Microwave
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered, from rentals as they
accrue and from services when performed. Long-term contract
sales follow the same policies as stated under our Government
Communications Systems segment’s revenue recognition policy
above. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by the
straight-line method over the term of the contracts. This
segment recognizes revenue when contractual obligations related
to customer acceptance of a product or performance are
satisfied. Further, if an arrangement other than a long-term
contract requires the delivery or performance of multiple
deliverables, or “elements,” the delivery of an
individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
are undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality
of the delivered element.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Network Support
segment:

Revenue in our Network
Support segment primarily relates to product and service sales.
Revenue is recognized from sales when a product is delivered and
from services when performed. Unearned income on service
contracts is amortized by the straight-line method over the term
of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue when
contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
requires the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables,
or “elements,” the delivery of an individual element
is considered not to have occurred if there are undelivered
elements that are essential to the functionality of the
delivered element.

Broadcast Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Broadcast
Communications segment primarily relates to product and service
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. Unearned income
on service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method
over the term of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue
when contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
other than a long-term contract requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables, or “elements,”
the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have
occurred if there are undelivered elements that are essential to
the functionality of the delivered element.

Other:

Royalty
income is included as a component of “Non-operating
income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income and is
recognized on the basis of terms specified in contractual
agreements.

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers
are classified on the Consolidated Statement of Income as
“Revenue from product sales and services” and the
associated costs are classified in “Cost of product sales
and services.”

Revenue from services was less than 10 percent of
total revenues during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000.

Retirement Benefits —

We provide retirement benefits to
substantially all employees primarily through a retirement plan
having profit sharing, matching and savings elements.
Contributions by us to the retirement plan are based on profits
and employees’ savings with no other funding requirements.
We may make additional contributions to the fund at our
discretion.

Retirement benefits also include an unfunded
limited healthcare plan for U.S.-based retirees and employees on
long-term disability. We accrue the estimated cost of these
medical benefits, which are not material, during an
employee’s active service life.

Environmental Expenditures —

We capitalize environmental
expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. We accrue
environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that
relate to past operations when the costs are probable and
reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party
at 14 sites where future liabilities could exist. These
sites include two sites owned by us, eight sites associated with
our former graphics or semiconductor locations, four of which
were sold to Intersil Corporation, and four treatment or
disposal sites not owned by us that allegedly contain hazardous
substances attributable to us from past operations. Based on an
assessment of relevant factors, we have estimated that our
discounted liability under the Superfund Act and other
environmental statutes and regulations for identified sites,
using a 7.5 percent discount rate, is approximately
$5.7 million. This liability is accrued in the
June 28, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expected
aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the
next 20 to 25 years (depending on the number of years for
each site) is approximately $8.9 million. The expected
payments for the next five years are: fiscal 2003 —
$1.8 million; fiscal 2004 — $0.8 million;
fiscal 2005 — $0.6 million; fiscal
2006 — $0.6 million; fiscal 2007 —
$0.4 million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is
approximately $4.7 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk
Management —

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”) requires us



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

to recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges
must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are either offset against the
change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is
immediately recognized in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a
combination of foreign currency call options, foreign currency
forward contracts and option contracts in the form of cashless
collars for marketable securities to hedge against risks
associated with anticipated cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future and cash flows that are fixed or firmly
committed. These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value
at the time of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to
the anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
used to hedge these cash flows. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge
against the currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated
with anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement 133, such financial instruments are
marked-to-market using forward prices and fair market value
quotes with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of
hedge ineffectiveness. The foreign currency call options and
forward contracts are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Cost of product sales and services” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income when the underlying net cash
flows are realized. The cashless collars for marketable
securities are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Non-operating income” on the Consolidated Statement
of Income when the underlying net cash flows are realized.
Unrealized losses are recorded in “Other accrued
items” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to
other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.
Unrealized gains are recorded as “Other assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to these financial
instruments, but we do not expect any of the counterparties to
fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, we
select counterparties based on credit ratings, limit our
exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines and
monitor the market position with each counterparty. In the event
of the termination of a derivative designated as a hedge, the
settlement would be charged to the Consolidated Statement of
Income as a component of “Non-operating income.”

Foreign Currency Translation —

The functional currency for most
international subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange and
income and expense items are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Unearned Compensation —

Compensation resulting from
performance shares granted under our long-term incentive plan is
amortized to expense over the performance period and is adjusted
for changes in the market value of our Common Stock.

Net Income Per Share —

Net income per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
year.

Reclassifications —

Certain prior-year amounts have been
reclassified on the consolidated financial statements to conform
with current year classifications.

Other Accrued Items and Other
Assets —

No accrued
liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other accrued
items” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed five
percent of our total current liabilities as of June 28, 2002 and
as of June 29, 2001. No current assets other than those already
disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed five percent
of our total current assets as of June 28, 2002 and as of June

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed five percent of total
assets as of June 28, 2002 and as of June 29, 2001.

Stock Options —

In accordance with APB Opinion
No. 25, we use the intrinsic-value method of accounting for
stock option awards to employees and, accordingly, do not
recognize compensation expense for our stock option awards to
employees in the Consolidated Statement of Income. See
“Stock Options and Awards” footnote for pro forma
information on the impact of the fair-value method of accounting
for stock options.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“Statement 141”) and
Statement 142. Statement 141 eliminates the pooling method
of accounting for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 and addresses the initial recognition and
measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in
a business combination. We adopted this accounting standard for
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

As of the beginning of the first quarter of
fiscal 2002, we also adopted Statement 142, which addresses
the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill
and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition.
Statement 142 requires that goodwill be disclosed
separately from other intangible assets in the statement of
financial position, and no longer be amortized but tested for
impairment on a periodic basis. The provisions of
Statement 142 also require the completion of a transitional
impairment test within six months of adoption, with any
impairments identified treated as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. We have completed our impairment
tests, which resulted in no adverse impact on our operations or
financial position.

In accordance with Statement 142, we
discontinued the amortization of goodwill as of the beginning of
the first quarter of fiscal 2002. A reconciliation of previously
reported net income and net income per common share to the
amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization net
of the related income tax effect follows:

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting
for Retirement Obligations” (“Statement 143”).
Statement 143 establishes accounting standards for the
recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation
and its associated asset retirement cost. It also provides
accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Statement 143 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002,
with early adoption permitted. We currently are evaluating the
provisions of Statement 143, but we expect that the provisions
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“Statement 144”). Statement 144 supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, but
retains its fundamental provisions for the (a) recognition
and measurement of impairment of long-lived assets to be held
and used, and (b) measurement of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. Statement 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 30 for segments of a business to be
disposed of, but retains the requirement to report discontinued
operations separately from continuing operations and extends
that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held for sale. We are required
to adopt Statement 144, effective for fiscal 2003. We do
not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections”
(“Statement 145”). Statement 145 updates,
clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements.
Statement 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 4 (“Statement 4”), which
required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be
aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary
item, net of related income tax effect. As a result, the
criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 will
now be used to classify those gains and losses because
Statement 4 has been rescinded. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 44 (“Statement 44”)
was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects
of transition to provisions of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.
Because the transition has been completed, Statement 44 is
no longer necessary. Statement 145 amends Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13
(“Statement 13”) to require that certain lease
modifications that have economic effects similar to
sale-leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner
as sale-leaseback transactions. This amendment is consistent
with the FASB’s goal of requiring similar accounting
treatment for transactions that have similar economic effects.
Statement 145 also makes technical corrections to existing
pronouncements. While those corrections are not substantive in
nature, in some instances, they may change accounting practice.
We are required to adopt Statement 145, effective for
fiscal 2003. We do not expect the adoption of Statement 145
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,”
(“Statement 146”). Statement 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” (“Issue 94-3”). The
principal difference between Statement 146 and
Issue 94-3 relates to Statement 146’s
requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity. Statement 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost as generally
defined in Issue 94-3 was recognized at the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan. A fundamental
conclusion reached by the FASB in this Statement is that an
entity’s commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create
an obligation that meets the definition of a liability.
Therefore, this Statement eliminates the definition and
requirements for recognition of exit costs in Issue 94-3.
This Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective
for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of this
Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. We are still assessing
whether the adoption of Statement 146 will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In fiscal 1999, we decided to sell our
semiconductor business and to spin off our Lanier Worldwide,
Inc. subsidiary. Accordingly, the results of operations and the
net assets of these business segments have been reclassified as
discontinued operations.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

On August 13, 1999, we completed the sale of
substantially all of our semiconductor business to Intersil
Corporation and its affiliates. Intersil Corporation was a newly
formed company owned by Sterling Holding Company, LLC, a
Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. investment portfolio company,
along with certain management investors and affiliates of Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of
land, buildings, equipment, inventory, receivables, technology
and other assets related to the operation of our semiconductor
business.

In addition to acquiring a 10 percent equity
interest in Intersil Corporation for which we paid
$9 million, we received cash of $520 million, a
promissory note of $90 million and Intersil Corporation
assumed certain liabilities. We also retained receivables and
patent rights. We recorded an after-tax loss of $76 million
for the disposal of our entire semiconductor business including
the portion sold to Intersil Corporation. Intersil Corporation
undertook an initial public offering (IPO) in February of 2000.
At that time, the promissory note mentioned above was paid as
was the accrued interest. We have sold most of our holdings in
Intersil.

On October 22, 1999, we announced that our
Board of Directors formally approved the spin-off of our Lanier
Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an independent publicly traded
company. The Board declared a dividend of one share of Lanier
common stock for each share of our Common Stock to our
shareholders of record on November 1, 1999. The
distribution of the dividend was completed on November 5,
1999. We retained approximately 10 percent of the
outstanding shares of Lanier, all of which were sold in fiscal
2001.

Summarized financial information for the
discontinued operations follows:

The income from discontinued operations includes
an allocation of interest expense of $16.5 million in
fiscal 2000. This allocation is based on the assigned debt
balances of the discontinued operations.

RESTRUCTURING

In fiscal 2000, we recorded a $41.0 million
charge ($26.7 million after income tax) for the
restructuring of our operations. Restructuring actions included
a reduction of approximately 161 employees and provisions for
the write-down of intangible assets, equipment and other assets
associated with the exit from our Network Support segment’s
telephone switching and alarm management product lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161
switching business employees were notified that their employment
would be terminated and what their specific severance benefit
would be. These employees worked in the marketing, sales,
manufacturing and administrative areas and were primarily
located in Marin County, California. As of September 29,
2000, the employment of all 161 employees had been terminated.

In June of 2000, we sold the core switch business
to Teltronics, Inc. and in August of 2000, we sold the alarm
management product line. We also sold the international
activities of these product lines during fiscal 2001. Estimated
discounted cash flows were used in determining the fair value of
assets and liabilities in recording the restructuring charge.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

We completed the payment of all severance
benefits during the second quarter of fiscal 2001. No further
cash outlays from these restructuring actions are expected.

Sales from these product lines were none in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, and $73.5 million in fiscal
2000. The losses before income taxes from these product lines
were none in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, and $18.9 million
in fiscal 2000.

The components and use of restructuring reserves
are summarized below:

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In August 2000, we purchased WavTrace, Inc.
(“WavTrace”), a developer of broadband wireless access
systems for high-speed wireless access to the Internet and other
data, voice and video services. This acquisition has been
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the results of operations of WavTrace have been
included in the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date
of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, we owned slightly less
than 20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase price for the
remaining approximately 80 percent is valued at
$144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as follows:

Wavtrace is being operated within our Microwave
Communications segment.

The amount of consideration to the former
shareholders and option holders of WavTrace was determined by
arm’s-length negotiation between the parties and was paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The amount
allocated to purchased in-process research and development on
the WavTrace acquisition was $73.5 million. The purchased
in-process research and development expenses were determined
through established valuation techniques in the technology
communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed. Research and development
costs to bring the products from the acquired company to
technological feasibility did not have a material impact on our
results of operations or cash flows. The WavTrace acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $53.9 million.

In May 2001, we purchased Exigent International,
Inc. (“Exigent”), a software and service provider for
satellite command and control, telecommunications and
information technology, primarily for government markets. This
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of
Exigent have been included in the Consolidated Statement of



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Income since the date of acquisition. The
purchase price of Exigent was $34.7 million, which is
calculated as follows:

Exigent is being operated within our Government
Communications Systems segment.

The amount of consideration to the former
shareholders and option holders of Exigent was determined by
arm’s-length negotiation between the parties and was paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The Exigent
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $19.7 million and other
identifiable intangible assets of $4.1 million. The other
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods between four and eight years.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma
basis, combines the consolidated results of operations as if
WavTrace and Exigent had been acquired as of the beginning of
the periods presented, after including the impact of adjustments
such as: amortization of intangibles, decreased interest income
from the use of cash and cash equivalents, compensation expense
from converted options and the related income tax effects.

The pro forma results are not necessarily
indicative of what actually would have occurred had we acquired
WavTrace and Exigent for the entire periods presented. In
addition, the pro forma results are not intended to be a
projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies
that might be achieved from combined operations.

In January 2000, we purchased Louth Automation
(“Louth”), a leading supplier of advanced automation
systems for radio and television broadcasters. On June 30,
2000, which was in fiscal 2000, we purchased the assets of TRT
Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point microwave radio
business (“TRT”). On June 30, 2001, which was in
fiscal 2002, we purchased the assets of Hirschmann Multimedia
Communications Network (“Hirschmann”). These
acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of
these acquired entities have been included in the Consolidated
Statement of Income since the date of acquisition. Pro forma
results of operations have not been presented because the effect
of these acquisitions was not material. We paid cash in the net
amount of approximately $90 million for Louth,
$23 million for TRT and $8.6 million for Hirschmann.
The amount allocated to purchased in-process research and
development in the Louth acquisition was $10.7 million. The
purchased in-process research and development expenses were
determined through established valuation techniques in the
communications technology industry and were expensed upon
acquisition because technological feasibility had not been
established and no future alternative uses existed. Research and
development costs to bring the products from the acquired
company to technological feasibility are not expected to have a
material impact on our future results of operations or cash
flows. The Louth acquisition resulted in goodwill of
$81.0 million. The TRT acquisition resulted in goodwill of
$19.0 million and other identifiable intangible assets of
$7.3 million. The other identifiable intangible assets are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years. The
Hirschmann acquisition resulted in goodwill of
$7.6 million. The final determination and allocation of the
purchase price and goodwill for the Hirschmann acquisition has
not been completed and the amounts are subject to change. We
expect to finalize this allocation in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003.

Louth and Hirschmann are being operated within
our Broadcast Communications segment, and TRT is being operated
within our Microwave Communications segment.

JOINT VENTURES

We have investments in joint ventures (less than
50% owned), which are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Condensed balance sheets as of June 28, 2002
and June 29, 2001, and condensed statements of income for
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 for these joint ventures
follows. In June of 2001, we sold our minority interest in our
GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture for
$50.0 million cash, which resulted in a pretax gain of
$33.4 million. In August 2001, we sold our minority
interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC joint
venture for $23.0 million cash, which resulted in a pretax
gain of $10.3 million.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for
the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002, by business segment,
are as follows:

We have other identifiable intangible assets
related primarily to technology acquired through acquisition.
These other identifiable intangible assets included in
“Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were
$12.6 million at June 28, 2002 and $11.6 million
at June 29, 2001. Accumulated amortization related to other
identifiable intangibles was $4.0 million at June 28,
2002 and $2.3 million at June 29, 2001. Our other
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their
useful economic lives, which range from five years to
17 years. The weighted average useful life of our other
identifiable intangible assets is 12.0 years. Amortization
expense related to other identifiable intangible assets was
$1.7 million in fiscal 2002, $0.8 million in fiscal
2001 and $0.2 million in fiscal 2000. The estimated
amortization expense for the five fiscal years following fiscal
2002 are: $1.9 million in fiscal 2003, $1.9 million in
fiscal 2004, $1.8 million in fiscal 2005, $1.2 million
in fiscal 2006, $1.1 million in fiscal 2007 and
$4.7 million thereafter.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

We have available committed syndicated credit
facilities with various banks that provide for borrowings up to
$325.5 million. The credit facilities consist of a
$212.5 million 3-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in
May of 2004, and a $113 million 364-Day Credit Agreement
that expires in May of 2003. Interest rates on borrowings under
these facilities and related fees are determined by a pricing
matrix based upon our long-term debt rating assigned by Standard
and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors
Service. The availability of these facilities is not contingent
upon our debt rating. We are not required to maintain
compensating balances in connection with these agreements. At
June 28, 2002 no amounts were borrowed under our credit
facilities, however, availability of borrowings under these
facilities are required in order for us to be eligible to issue
commercial paper. The financial covenants contained in these
facilities include, among others, maintenance of consolidated
tangible net worth of not less than $777 million (which
amount was initially $700 million and is subject to further
increase), maintenance of a total debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”) ratio of not more than 3.0 and a limit on
total debt to $800 million. These credit facilities also
include negative covenants (i) limiting the creation of
liens or other encumbrances, (ii) limiting certain sale and
leaseback transactions and (iii) limiting certain sales or
other dispositions of assets other than in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, these facilities include certain
provisions for acceleration of maturity in the case of a
(a) “cross default” with other indebtedness in an
amount in excess of $25 million, (b) final uninsured
judgment in excess of $25 million which remains unpaid or
discharged or (c) change of control, including if a person
or group of persons acquires more than 25 percent of our
voting stock.

We also have an effective shelf registration
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
provides for the issuance of debt securities of up to
$500 million.

We also have lines of credit for short-term
financing aggregating $79.2 million from various U.S. and
foreign banks, of which $54.6 million was available on
June 28, 2002. These arrangements provide for borrowing at
various interest rates, are reviewed annually for renewal, and
may be used on such terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and
us. These lines do not require compensating balances.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $24.6 million at
June 28, 2002 and $33.2 million at June 29, 2001
is entirely made up of notes payable to banks in both years.
Bank notes with Brazilian banks amounted to $11.4 million
at June 28, 2002 with a weighted-average interest rate of
19.2 percent and $10.0 million at June 29, 2001
with a weighted-average interest rate of 18.9 percent. The
weighted-average interest rate for bank notes other than those
with Brazilian banks was 4.3 percent at June 28, 2002
and 4.9 percent at June 29, 2001.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt includes the following:

The weighted-average interest rate for other
long-term debt to banks was 3.0 percent at June 28,
2002 and 8.4 percent at June 29, 2001. Maturities of
long-term debt for the five years following fiscal 2002 are:
$31.8 million in fiscal 2003, $0.9 million in fiscal
2004, $0.2 million in fiscal 2005, none in fiscal 2006 and $1.4
million in fiscal 2007.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

We expect to refinance the 6.38% notes payable to
bank, which are due in fiscal 2003. It is our intent to maintain
this debt for longer than one year. Thus, this amount has not
been classified in current liabilities and remains in long-term
debt on the balance sheet.

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE
RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, we declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share
of Common Stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by the Common Stock share certificates,
trade with the Common Stock until they become exercisable, and
entitle the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
Participating Preferred Stock for $125, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of 10 business
days (or such later date fixed by the Board) after a party
commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire a beneficial
interest of at least 15 percent of our outstanding Common
Stock, or the first date of public announcement by us that a
person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding Common Stock, or such later
date fixed by our Board of Directors.

Upon the first date of public announcement by us
that a person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding Common Stock, or such later
date fixed by our Board of Directors, each right (other than
rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any
affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the holder to
purchase shares of our Common Stock having a market value equal
to twice the exercise price of the right. In addition, each
right (other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring
person or any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the
rightholder to exercise the right and receive shares of common
stock of the acquiring company, upon a merger or other business
combination, having a market value of twice the exercise price
of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights
become exercisable, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange
all of the then outstanding rights for shares of Common Stock at
an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per right,
subject to adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and
may be redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $.01 per
right at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial
ownership of 15 percent of the outstanding Common Stock.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The following information relates to stock option
and incentive stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent
of market value on the date the options are granted. Option
grants are for a maximum of 10 years after dates of grant
and may be exercised in installments.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, we
use the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option
awards granted to employees and, accordingly, do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
the Consolidated Statement of Income. This footnote includes pro
forma information on the impact of the fair-value method of
accounting for stock options.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Price ranges of outstanding and exercisable
options at June 28, 2002 are summarized below:

Presented below is pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share. It has been
determined as if we had accounted for stock options using the
fair value method of accounting for stock options. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions:

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the
estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense over
their three-year vesting period. Under the fair value method,
our net income and net income per share would have been reduced
by the following amounts:

The weighted average fair value of options at
their grant date during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal
2000, where the exercise price equaled the market price on the
grant date, were $9.66, $9.41 and $8.95, respectively.

We have stock incentive plans for directors and
employees. Awards under these plans may include the grant of
performance shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock
appreciation rights or other stock-based awards. Performance
shares outstanding under the stock incentive plan were 167,000
at June 28, 2002, 139,342 at June 29, 2001 and 209,716
at June 30, 2000. Shares of Common Stock reserved for future



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

awards under the stock incentive plan were
8,503,111 at June 28, 2002, 9,534,413 at June 29, 2001
and 3,242,441 at June 30, 2000.

The weighted average fair values of performance
shares at their grant date during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000, were $29.80, $27.83 and $26.77, respectively.

Total compensation income
(expense) recognized from performance shares was
$3.6 million in fiscal 2002, ($1.1) million in fiscal 2001
and $3.6 million in fiscal 2000.

Under our domestic retirement plan, employees may
purchase a limited amount of our Common Stock at 70 percent
of current market value. The discounts from fair market value on
Common Stock purchased by employees under the domestic
retirement plans are charged to compensation expense in the
period of the related purchase. Shares of Common Stock reserved
for future purchases by the retirement plan were 2,172,688 at
June 28, 2002.

NET INCOME PER SHARE

Average outstanding shares used in the
computation of net income per share are summarized below:

RETIREMENT PLANS

Retirement plan expense from continuing
operations amounted to $46.1 million in fiscal 2002,
$30.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $37.4 million in
fiscal 2000.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs from continuing operations are expensed as
incurred. These costs were $103.9 million in fiscal 2002,
$113.8 million in fiscal 2001 and $99.9 million in
fiscal 2000.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs
are incurred pursuant to long-term contractual arrangements and
are accounted for principally by the percentage-of-completion
method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
incurred under government-sponsored contracts require us to
provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance
or other specifications (such as designs). Customer-sponsored
research and development costs were $412.3 million in
fiscal 2002, $372.5 million in fiscal 2001 and
$379.8 million in fiscal 2000.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Total interest from continuing operations was
$26.7 million in fiscal 2002, $34.8 million in fiscal
2001 and $25.2 million in fiscal 2000. Interest
attributable to funds used to finance major long-term
construction projects can be capitalized as an additional cost
of the related asset. No interest was capitalized in fiscal
2002, fiscal 2001 or fiscal 2000. Interest paid was
$29.4 million in fiscal 2002, $35.3 million in fiscal
2001 and $25.5 million in fiscal 2000.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense from continuing operations
amounted to $22.3 million in fiscal 2002,
$20.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $21.7 million in fiscal
2000. Future minimum rental commitments under leases, primarily
for land and buildings, amounted to approximately
$69.7 million at June 28, 2002. These commitments for
the years following fiscal 2002 are: fiscal 2003 —
$19.1 million; fiscal 2004 — $14.3 million;
fiscal 2005 — $11.8 million; fiscal
2006 — $8.8 million; fiscal 2007 —
$6.7 million; and $9.0 million, thereafter.

DERIVATIVES INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
ACTIVITY

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use foreign exchange contracts and
options to hedge both balance sheet and future foreign currency
commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset
foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments
from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed
sales to customers and intercompany loans. We believe the use of
foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks,
which arise from doing business in international markets. At
June 28, 2002, we had open foreign exchange contracts with
a notional amount of $83.5 million, of which
$44.8 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$38.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $43.0 million as of June 29, 2001, of which
$6.3 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$36.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
June 28, 2002, contract expiration dates range from less
than one month to three years with a weighted average contract
life of 0.5 years.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the United
Kingdom Bowman Programme in our RF Communications segment. This
contract for our tactical radio products was awarded in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer
pays in Pounds Sterling (“GBP”). We also have payments
to local suppliers in GBP on this program. We have hedged the
forecasted sales and vendor payments denominated in GBP to
maintain our anticipated profit margin in U.S. dollars. As of
June 28, 2002, we estimated that a pretax loss of
$1.8 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next three years related to
these transactions. The net gain or loss included in our
earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001 representing the amount of fair
value and cash flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was
$0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. No
amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001
related to the component of the derivatives instruments’
gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in our
earnings in fiscal 2002 and 2001 related to hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of
these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on the
balance sheet in accordance with Statement 133.

Marketable Securities:

We utilize option contracts in the
form of cashless collars to hedge anticipated cash flows from
the sale of marketable securities. Contracts are generally one
year or less. At June 28, 2002, we had open option
contracts for 175,000 shares of Intersil Corporation stock at a
weighted average strike price of $32.26, which compares to
850,000 shares at a weighted average strike price of $32.35 as
of June 29, 2001. All of these collars were classified as
cash flow hedges and recorded at their fair value on the balance
sheet in accordance with Statement 133. The fair market
value of these collars reflected in the caption “Other
assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 28,
2002 was $1.9 million. The fair market value of these
collars reflected in the caption “Other accrued items”
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2001 was
$1.8 million.

A reconciliation of the statutory United States
income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows:

United States income taxes have not been provided
on $377.2 million of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest
these earnings. The determination of unrecognized deferred U.S.
tax liability for the undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries is not practicable.

Tax loss and credit carryforwards have expiration
dates ranging between 2 and 20 years.

Pretax income from continuing operations of
international subsidiaries was $1.2 million in fiscal 2002,
$4.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $1.0 million in fiscal
2000.

Income taxes paid were $20.7 million in
fiscal 2002, $33.7 million in fiscal 2001 and
$47.4 million in fiscal 2000.

The state income tax benefit for fiscal 2002
relates principally to the favorable resolution of certain
outstanding state tax liabilities, for which we had previously
provided.

During fiscal 2002, a valuation allowance of
$6.5 million was established for financial reporting
purposes, to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax
assets due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them
in the future.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we
serve and operate in five business segments —
Government Communications Systems, RF Communications, Microwave
Communications, Network Support and Broadcast Communications.
Our Government Communications Systems segment engages in
advanced research and develops, designs and produces advanced
communication and information processing systems. Our RF
Communications segment performs advance research and develops,
designs, manufactures and sells tactical radio products and
provides services related to tactical radio products. Our
Microwave Communications segment designs, manufactures and sells
microwave radio products and provides services related to
microwave radio products. Our Network Support segment designs,

Our products and systems are produced principally
in the United States with international revenues derived
primarily from exports. No revenues earned from any individual
foreign country exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue
during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 or fiscal 2000.

The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the “Significant
Accounting Policies” footnote. We evaluate performance
based on income or loss before income taxes excluding interest
income and expense, equity income, goodwill amortization and
gains or losses from securities and other investments.
Intersegment sales, which are insignificant, are accounted for
at prices

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. The debentures initially carry an annual
interest rate of 3.5 percent. The Convertible Debentures
offering was made only to qualified institutional buyers under
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”) and outside the United States
pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The
interest rate on the convertible debentures will be reset,
within a specified range, in 2007, 2012 and 2017. These
debentures are unsecured obligations convertible into shares of
our common stock at an initial conversion price of $45.25 per
share, subject to adjustment, under any of the following
circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter if the
closing sale price of our common stock, for



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
previous calendar quarter, is more than 110 percent of the
applicable conversion price per share of our common stock on
such last trading day, (ii) if we have called the
debentures for redemption, (iii) upon the occurrence of
specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures or
(iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
transactions. The debentures were issued at 100 percent of
the principal amount, less a discount of 2.5 percent to the
initial purchasers. We may redeem the debentures commencing
August 2007 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus
accrued interest, if any. Holders may require us to repurchase
the debentures, in whole or in part, on specified dates in 2007,
2012 and 2017 or upon the occurrence of certain other events at
100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest,
if any.
