HARRIS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K



PART  I

Item  1.  BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY

Harris Corporation is an international company focused on
communications equipment for voice, data and video applications.
Harris was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to
three companies founded in the 1890’s. The principal
executive offices of Harris Corporation (hereinafter called
“Harris” or the “Company”) are located at
1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919, and
 the telephone number is (321) 727-9100.

Recent Development of Business

During fiscal 2000, Harris continued its repositioning as a pure
communications equipment company. Harris completed the spin-off
of Lanier Worldwide, Inc. and the sale of Harris’
semiconductor business. Additionally, Harris announced its exit
from the telephone switching and alarm management product lines.
Harris also completed several acquisitions designed to strengthen
 its position in the communications markets.

Spin-off of Lanier Worldwide.

In November 1999,
Harris completed the spin-off of its Lanier Worldwide, Inc.
subsidiary as an independent publicly owned company. The
transaction was effected through the distribution of
approximately 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Lanier to Harris shareholders. Harris retained the remaining 10%
of Lanier’s outstanding shares.

Sale of Semiconductor Business.

In August 1999, Harris
completed the sale of substantially all of its semiconductor
business to Intersil Corporation, a subsidiary of Sterling
Holding Company, LLC, a Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd.
investment portfolio company. Upon consummation of the sale,
Harris received $520 million in cash, $90 million of
subordinated notes, and a 10% equity interest in Intersil Holding
 Corporation. In connection with the transaction, Intersil also
assumed most of the liabilities associated with the semiconductor
 business. Intersil Holding Corporation completed its initial
public offering in February 2000 and is now a publicly traded
company. Harris also sold its suppression semiconductor business
to Littlefuse, Inc. during fiscal 2000.

Repositioning.

In addition to the spin-off of Lanier and
the sale of the semiconductor business, Harris completed
additional steps to reposition itself as a pure communications
equipment company and also undertook an internal reorganization.
The internal reorganization included the elimination of the
sector organization level, reduction of general and
administrative expenses and the realignment of the commercial and
 government businesses into one company focused on the
communications market. Harris also decided to exit the telephone
switching and alarm management product lines.

Acquisition of Louth Automation.

In January 2000,
Harris purchased Louth Automation, a leading supplier of advanced
 automation systems for digital television, over-the-air
broadcast, and cable and industrial applications. Harris paid
cash in the net amount of approximately $87 million. The
acquisition of Louth Automation brings Harris competencies in
automation and control to complement Harris’ leadership
position in broadcast transmission and digital encoding, thus
further broadening Harris’ global position in the broadcast
markets.

Acquisition of TRT Lucent Technologies’ Point-to-Point
Microwave Business.

In June 2000, Harris purchased the
point-to-point microwave business of TRT Lucent Technologies to
enhance our capabilities in microwave communication product
offerings. The acquisition also provides for a five-year
preferred supplier agreement for Harris to serve the worldwide
point-to-point microwave needs of Lucent’s wireless
divisions.

As a result of the spin-off of Lanier Worldwide and the sale of
all of the semiconductor business, Harris’ consolidated
financial statements and notes for prior periods report these
businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, prior
periods have been restated. In addition, as a result of its
internal reorganization, the continuing operations of Harris are
reported under two segments: (1) the Government
Communications



segment, which is comprised of the operations of the former
Electronic Systems Sector, and (2) the Commercial
Communications segment, which is comprised of the operations of
the former Communications Sector. Various corporate assets, other
 income, interest income, interest expense and corporate overhead
 expenses are not assigned to the segments.

General

Harris, along with its subsidiaries, is a worldwide company
focused on the worldwide market for voice, data and video
communications equipment.

Harris structures its operations around two segments: the
Government Communications segment and the Commercial
Communications segment, which has four divisions. Each of
Harris’ divisions have been organized on the basis of
specific communications technology and markets. For the most
part, each operating division has its own marketing, engineering,
 manufacturing and service organization. Harris produces most of
the products it sells, except for certain broadcast products sold
 by the Broadcast Communications Division, which products are
sourced from a variety of manufacturers. Reference is made to the
 Note

Business Segments

in the Notes to Financial
Statements for further information with respect to business
segments.

Total revenues in fiscal 2000 increased to approximately
$1.81 billion from approximately $1.74 billion a year
earlier. Total sales in the United States increased approximately
 2 percent from a year earlier while international sales,
which amounted to approximately 27 percent of the total from
 continuing operations, increased approximately 9 percent.
Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2000 before an
extraordinary item decreased to $25.0 million from
$49.9 million in fiscal 1999.

The markets served and principal products of the Company’s
business segments are as follows:

	network management and workforce management systems.

Sales in fiscal 2000 for the Commercial Communications segment
increased 6.6 percent over fiscal 1999. Excluding sales from
 the recently exited telephone switching product line, the
Commercial Communications segment sales increased from $803.7
million to $918.0 million or 14.2 percent. Segment operating loss
 of $33.3 million, down from profit of $34.1 million in
 fiscal 1999 was impacted by the $41.0 million restructuring
 charge and the $10.7 million purchased in-process research
and development write-off in connection with the acquisition of
Louth Automation as well as a $12.0 million write-down of
inventory related to the exited telephone switching and alarm
management product lines. The segment contributed 55 percent
 of Harris’ total sales from continuing operations in fiscal
 2000 and 53 percent in fiscal 1999.

The Broadcast Communications Division is a leading manufacturer
and supplier of digital and analog radio and television broadcast
 encoding and transmission equipment, systems and services, and
radio studio equipment, systems and services. This division
provided the nation’s first advanced television transmitter
to broadcast digital television as well as the first commercial
digital television application. The division is also expanding
its efforts in the digital radio area and is developing the next
wave of radio-broadcasting including In-Band/On Channel digital
radio. The division’s products include (1) radio and
television transmitters, antennas, and encoders and
(2) audio, remote-control and video production systems. The
division is also a leading supplier of mobile broadcast units and
 provides comprehensive television and radio studio integration
services. Following the acquisition of Louth Automation, the
division also supplies advanced automation systems for digital
television, over-the-air broadcast, and cable and industrial
applications.

The Microwave Communications Division is a leading producer of
digital and analog microwave communication products and systems
in North America and is expanding its international presence in
such markets, particularly in Latin America and Europe. This
division focuses on two primary applications for microwave:
(1) links to connect cellular and PCS sites, and
(2) private network applications. Private network
applications include electric utilities, railroads, local
governments, and emergency service operations where the public
telephone network is not reliable, does not exist, or is not
sufficiently secure. Additionally, this division designs,
manufactures, and markets wireless local loop telephony equipment
 for private, government, and public phone system customers
operating worldwide. This division also focuses on high-frequency
 communications and provides broadband wireless access to the
latest Internet, voice, data and video applications, including
millimeter wave technology. The division’s broadband
wireless access products have dynamic bandwith-on-demand
allocation capabilities which allow a single wireless link to
serve many subscribers. The division has recently expanded its
international offerings through the acquisition of the
point-to-point microwave business of TRT Lucent Technologies. It
is also anticipated that the division will be a leader in
point-to-multipoint microwave applications following the closing
of the acquisition of Wavtrace, Inc., a privately-held leading
developer of broadband wireless access systems.

The Network Support Division provides a complete range of
products and systems to test, manage, and enhance communications
network infra-structures. The division supplies telecommunication
 products and systems, including automated line and telephone
test systems and tools (including portable and remote test
units), operational support systems to manage telephone
subscriber loops, and network and workforce management systems.
The division provides network management systems and services for
 large, multimedia



communications networks. The division has recently exited the
telephone switching and alarm management product businesses.

The RF Communications Division is a leading supplier of multiband
 and secure wireless radio communication products, systems and
services, including two-way HF, VHF and UHF radio equipment, and
offers a comprehensive line of products, including ground-to-air
avionics radios and systems for long-distance and short-distance
communications for commercial, military, law enforcement and
government applications. This division is a leader in
lightweight, man-portable and mobile radios for law enforcement,
tactical and military forces around the world. Its radio products
 include a secure, mobile communications platform that also
provides law enforcement agents with access to the national crime
 information database for fingerprint matching.

Principal customers for products of the Commercial Communications
 segment include foreign and domestic commercial and industrial
firms, radio and television broadcasters, communication
companies, telephone companies, governmental and military
agencies, utilities, railroads, construction companies and oil
producers.

In general, the segment’s domestic products are sold and
serviced directly to customers through the sales organizations of
 the operating divisions and through established distribution
channels. Internationally, the segment markets and sells its
products and services through established and newly created
regional sales offices and established distribution channels and
has increased its focus in South America and other promising
international markets, particularly in the microwave radio area.
See “International Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment of Harris’
business was $367 million at July 31, 2000,
substantially all of which is expected to be filled during the
2001 fiscal year, compared with approximately $366 million a year
 earlier.

Government Communications Segment

The Government Communications segment of Harris is engaged in
advanced research, design, development and production of advanced
 communication, information processing and electronic products,
services, systems and sub-systems for government and commercial
organizations in the United States and internationally. The
segment specializes in airborne, spaceborne, shipboard, and
ground communications for the United States government.
Applications of the segment’s state-of-the-art technologies
include:

The Government Communications segment is a major supplier of
advanced-technology communications and information processing
systems to the United States Department of Defense, Federal
Aviation Administration, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal
 and local government agencies, aircraft manufacturers, and
airports.



Sales in fiscal 2000 for this business segment increased
0.3 percent to $815.9 million from $813.2 million
in fiscal 1999. Operating profit increased 11.5 percent.
These results were impacted by an $18.0 million write-off in
 fiscal 1999 for the settlement of claims and unrecoverable
contract development costs on two contracts. Excluding this
write-off, sales decreased one percent, and operating income
declined 17.1 percent. This segment contributed
45 percent of Harris’ total sales from continuing
operations in fiscal 2000 and 47 percent in fiscal 1999.

The Government Communications segment is a leading supplier of
air-traffic control communication systems and is also a major
supplier of custom aircraft and spaceborne communication and
information processing systems, cockpit digital moving maps,
controls and display processors, a leading supplier of
terrestrial and satellite communication systems, including large
deployable satellite antenna systems and flat panel phased array
and single mission antennas, and is a preeminent supplier of
super-high-frequency military satellite ground terminals for the
Department of Defense. The segment is also diversifying into the
commercial satellite business and has been awarded contracts to
provide antennas for programs such as the Asian Cellular System.

The division is a major supplier of custom ground-based systems
and software designed to collect, store, retrieve, process,
analyze, display and distribute information for government,
defense and law enforcement applications, including
meteorological data processing systems and range management
information systems. The segment also provides computer
controlled electronic maintenance, logistic, simulation and test
systems for military aircraft, ships and ground vehicles and
provides sophisticated ground-based and shipboard command,
control, communication and intelligence systems, products and
services for many government end-users. The division’s
electronic products enable high speed communications for
platforms such as the USAF F-22 air superiority fighter and the
Army’s Commanche advanced armed reconnaissance helicopter.

Specific examples of technology developed by the division include
 the development of a family of wideband digital links to support
 the transmission of radar, imagery, and video from
reconnaissance aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellites
 and the development of a digital map that electronically
displays real-time terrain, flight paths, and target locations
for fighter helicopters. The division also has extensive
expertise in microelectronics and advanced wireless tracking
technology. While classified projects are not discussed in this
report, the operating results relating to classified projects are
 included in Harris’ consolidated financial statements, and
the business risks associated with such projects do not differ
materially from those of other projects for the United States
government.

The segment has formed three joint ventures with the General
Electric Company. GE-Harris Railway Electronics is a leader in
communication-based electronic planning, scheduling and control
systems for railways worldwide. GE Harris Energy Controls Systems
 is a leading supplier of intelligent energy management systems
and services electric utilities. GE Harris Aviation Information
Solutions provides information systems and services that enable
airlines to monitor and analyze aircraft and engine performance
data easier and faster, helping to improve airline efficiency and
 safety. The segment also has a joint venture with Sextant
In-flight Systems to provide live television transmission to
individual seats on commercial airlines.

Most of the sales of the Government Communications segment are
made directly or indirectly to the United States government under
 contracts or subcontracts containing standard government
contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if
applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the
government or for default of the contractor. These sales consist
of a variety of contracts and programs with various governmental
agencies, with no single program accounting for 10 percent
or more of total Harris sales.

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment of Harris’
business was $360 million at July 31, 2000, a
substantial portion of which is expected to be filled during the
2001 fiscal year, compared with $420 million a year earlier.

International Business

Net sales in fiscal 2000 of products exported from the United
States or manufactured abroad were $487.3 million or
27 percent of the Company’s total sales from continuing
 operations, compared with $448.5 million or 26 percent
 of the Company’s total sales from continuing operations in
fiscal 1999 and $556.4



or 29 percent in fiscal 1998. The Company’s
international sales include both direct exports from the United
States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Most of the
international sales are derived from the Commercial
Communications segment. Direct export sales are primarily
denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from foreign
subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of
the subsidiary. Exports from the United States from
continuing operations, principally to Europe, Latin America and
Asia, totaled $229.7 million or 47 percent of the
international sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2000,
$242.2 million or 54 percent of the international sales from
 continuing operations in fiscal 1999 and $320.6 million or
58 percent of the international sales from continuing
operations in fiscal 1998.

Foreign operations represented 14 percent of net sales from
continuing operations and 17 percent of long-lived assets
from continuing operations as of the end of fiscal 2000.
Electronic products and systems are produced principally in the
United States, and international electronic revenues are
derived primarily from exports. Communication products assembly
facilities are located in Brazil, Canada, China and the United
Kingdom.

International marketing activities are conducted through
subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
America and Asia. Harris has also established a new international
 marketing organization and several regional sales offices.
Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
Registrant” for further information regarding foreign
subsidiaries.

Harris utilizes indirect sales channels, including dealers,
distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale
 of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and
internationally. These independent representatives may buy for
resale, or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
governmental customers for direct sales by Harris. Prices to the
ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
established by the independent representative and may be on a
basis which is above or below the Company’s list prices.
These independent representatives generally receive a discount
from the Company’s list prices and may mark-up those prices
in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. During
the 2000 fiscal year, sales from indirect sales channels
represented 16 percent of Harris’ total sales and
19 percent of Harris’ international sales. Fiscal year
2000 orders came from a large number of foreign countries, no one
 of which accounted for five percent or more of the
Company’s total orders.

Certain of Harris’ exports are paid for by letters of
credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or
installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments or
other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often
cover most of the related costs incurred. Performance guarantees
by the Company are generally required on significant foreign
government contracts. In order to stay competitive in
international markets, the Company also enters into recourse
financing in order to facilitate sales to certain customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
business conducted outside the United States differ from those
encountered by domestic businesses. Management believes that the
composite business risk for the international business as a whole
 is somewhat greater than that faced by its domestic operations
as a whole. International business may subject the Company to
risks such as:

Nevertheless, in the opinion of management, these risks are
offset by the diversification of the international business and
the protection provided by letters of credit and advance
payments.

Except for inconsequential matters, such as matters involving
road and utility rights-of-way, Harris has never been subjected
to threat of government expropriation, either within the United
States or abroad.



Financial information regarding the Company’s domestic and
international operations is contained in the Note

Business
Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Competition

Harris operates in highly competitive businesses that are
sensitive to technological advances. Although successful product
and systems development is not necessarily dependent on
substantial financial resources, some of Harris’ competitors
 in each of its businesses are larger and can maintain higher
levels of expenditures for research and development than Harris.
Harris’ competitors in the Commercial Communications segment
 include large multinational communications companies as well as
smaller companies with developing technology expertise.
Harris’ competition for U.S. government contracts
typically are large, technically competent firms with substantial
 assets. Harris concentrates in each of its businesses on the
market opportunities which management believes are compatible
with its resources, overall technological capabilities, and
objectives. Principal competitive factors in these businesses are
 cost-effectiveness, product quality and reliability, service,
ability to meet delivery schedules, and the effectiveness of
dealers in international areas.

Principal Customers

Sales to the U.S. government, which is the Company’s only
customer accounting for 10 percent or more of total sales,
were 41 percent, 42 percent and 47 percent of the
Company’s total sales from continuing operations in fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. All U.S. government contracts
are terminable at the convenience of the U.S. government, as well
 as for default. Under contracts terminable at the convenience of
 the U.S. government a contractor is entitled to receive payments
 for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share
 of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts which are
terminable for default generally provide that the U.S. government
 only pays for the work it has accepted and may require the
contractor to pay for the incremental cost of reprocurement and
may hold the contractor liable for damages.

Companies engaged in supplying goods and services to the U.S.
government are dependent on congressional appropriations and
administrative allotment of funds, and may be affected by changes
 in U.S. government policies resulting from various military and
political developments. In many cases there is also additional
uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for
design improvements, and difficulty in forecasting costs and
schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated
technical work. For further discussion of risks relating to U.S.
government contracts see “Legal Proceedings.” It is not
 expected that changes to the Department of Defense budget will
have a material effect on the profitability of Harris in
fiscal 2001.

Backlog

Harris’ backlog of unfilled orders from continuing
operations was approximately:

•

$727 million at July 31, 2000,

•

$786 million at July 31, 1999, and

•

$741 million at July 31, 1998.

Substantially all of the backlog orders at July 31, 2000 are
 expected to be filled during fiscal 2001. The determination of
backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with
respect to customer requirements contracts, and long-term
contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.



Research, Development and Engineering

Research and engineering expenditures by Harris for its
continuing operations totaled approximately:

•

$480 million in fiscal 2000,

•

$500 million in fiscal 1999, and

•

$591 million in fiscal 1998.

Company-sponsored research and product development costs for its
continuing operations were approximately:

•

$100 million in fiscal 2000,

•

$92 million in fiscal 1999, and

•

$94 million in fiscal 1998.

The portion of total research and engineering expenditures not
Company-sponsored was funded by government and commercial
customers. Company-funded research is directed to the development
 of new products and to building technological capability in
selected communications and electronic systems areas.
Government-funded research helps strengthen and broaden the
technical capabilities of Harris in its areas of interest. Almost
 all of the operating divisions maintain their own engineering
and new product development departments, with scientific
assistance provided by advanced-technology departments.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Harris holds numerous patents which it considers, in the
aggregate, to constitute an important asset. However, Harris does
 not consider its business or any business segment to be
materially dependent upon any single patent or any group of
related patents. Harris is engaged in a pro-active patent
licensing program, especially in the Commercial Communications
segment, and has entered into a number of unilateral license and
cross-license agreements, many of which generate significant
royalty income. Although existing license agreements have
generated income in past years and will do so in the future,
there can be no assurances Harris will enter into additional
income producing license agreements. With regard to patents
relating to the Government Communications segment, however, the
U.S. government often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license, pursuant to which the government may use or
 authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents.
Pursuant to similar arrangements, the government may consent to
Harris’ use of inventions covered by patents owned by other
persons.

Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with Harris products
 are considered to be a valuable asset of Harris.

Environmental and Other Regulations

The manufacturing facilities of Harris, in common with those of
industry generally, are subject to numerous laws and regulations
designed to protect the environment, particularly in regard to
wastes and emissions. Harris believes that it has materially
complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not
 had a material adverse effect on its business or financial
condition. Expenditures to protect the environment and to comply
with current environmental laws and regulations over the next
several years are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s competitive or financial position. If future laws
and regulations contain more stringent requirements than
presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than the
 Company’s present estimates of those expenditures.

Waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment have
been installed to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve the
Company’s waste minimization and prevention goals. An
estimated $0.1 million was spent on environmental capital
projects in fiscal 2000, $0.3 million in fiscal 1999 and
$1.7 million in fiscal 1998. A significant portion of these
expenditures related to discontinued operations; however, the
Company has retained certain environmental liabilities with
respect to those discontinued operations. The Company currently
forecasts authorization for environmental-related capital
projects totaling $0.1 million in fiscal 2001. These amounts
 may increase in future years.

Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
forth in “Legal Proceedings” and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”



Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of the Company’s products and
services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its
facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide array
of raw materials needed for its operations and for products that
it sells. The Company is dependent upon suppliers and
subcontractors for a large number of components and the ability
of its suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and
quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances,
 the Company is dependent upon one or a few sources, either
because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because
 of domestic preference requirements pursuant to which it
operates on a given project. To date, the Company has not been
materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
materials or products.

Employees

As of June 30, 2000, Harris had approximately
10,000 employees, of whom approximately 8,500 were located
in the United States. In general, Harris believes that its
relations with its employees are good.

Item  2.  PROPERTIES.

Harris operates approximately 22 plants and approximately 66
offices in the United States, Canada, Europe, Central and South
America and Asia, consisting of about 3.9 million square
feet of manufacturing, administrative, warehousing, engineering
and office facilities that are owned and about 1.1 million
square feet of sales, office and manufacturing facilities that
are leased. The leased facilities are for the most part occupied
under leases for terms ranging from one year to 30 years, a
majority of which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than
five-year intervals at Harris’ option. The Company’s
corporate headquarters are owned and located in Melbourne,
Florida. The location of the principal manufacturing plants owned
 by the Company in the United States, and the business segments
which utilize such plants are as follows: Government
Communications segment — Malabar, Melbourne and Palm
Bay, Florida; and Commercial Communications segment —
Camarillo, Redwood Shores and Sunnyvale, California; Quincy,
Illinois; Littleton, Massachusetts; Cincinnati, Ohio; San
Antonio, Texas; and Rochester, New York. The Commercial
Communications segment also has principal manufacturing plants
which are owned by Harris and located outside of the United
States including plants in: Sao Paulo, Brazil; Montreal, Canada;
and Cambridge, U.K.

In the opinion of management, Harris’ facilities are
suitable and adequate for their intended purposes and have
capacities adequate for current and projected needs. Unused or
under-utilized facilities are not considered significant.

As of June 30, 2000, the following facilities were in
productive use by Harris in its operations:

Item  3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of
 business in which the Company is engaged, various claims or
charges are asserted and litigation commenced against the Company
 arising from or related to: product liability; patents,
trademarks, or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes; breach
 of warranty; antitrust; distribution; or contractual relations.
Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
of any real risk of court awards. While it is not feasible to
predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, in the
opinion of management, settlements and final judgments, if any,
which might be rendered against the Company in existing
litigation



are reserved against, covered by insurance or would not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or the
business of the Company as a whole.

Government contractors, such as the Company, engaged in supplying
 goods and services to the U.S. government and its various
agencies are dependent on congressional appropriations and
administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes
in U.S. government policies. U.S. government contracts typically
involve long lead times for design and development and are
subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and may be
unilaterally modified or cancelled by the government. Often these
 contracts call for successful design and production of complex
and technologically advanced products or systems. The Company may
 participate in supplying goods and services to the U.S.
government as either a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to
a prime contractor. Disputes may arise between the prime
contractor and the government and the prime contractor and its
subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
contracting parties.

From time to time, the Company, either individually or in
conjunction with other U.S. government contractors, may be the
subject of U.S. government investigations for alleged criminal or
 civil violations of procurement or other federal laws. These
investigations may be conducted without the Company’s
knowledge. The Company is currently cooperating with certain
government representatives in investigations relating to
potential violations of federal procurement and other laws. The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of such investigations
or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or other actions
that could be instituted against it, its officers or employees.
Under present government procurement regulations, if indicted or
adjudged in violation of procurement or other federal civil laws
a contractor, such as the Company, or one or more of its
operating divisions, could be suspended or debarred from
eligibility for awards of new government contracts for up to
three years. In addition, a government contractor’s foreign
export control licenses could be suspended or revoked. As an
international company, Harris is, from time to time, the subject
of investigations relating to its international operations,
including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
laws. Management does not believe that the outcome of these
current disputes or investigations will have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or the business of the Company
as a whole.

In addition, the Company is subject to numerous federal and state
 environmental laws and regulatory requirements and is involved
from time to time in investigations or litigation of various
potential environmental issues concerning ongoing activities at
its facilities or remediation as a result of past activities. The
 Company from time to time receives notices from the United
States Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent state
environmental agencies that it is a potentially responsible party
 (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
“Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent state legislation.
Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup costs at
various sites, which include Company-owned sites, previously
owned sites and non-Company owned treatment or disposal sites,
allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to the
Company from past operations. The Company has been named as a PRP
 at eleven such sites, excluding sites as to which the
Company’s records disclose no involvement or as to which the
 Company’s liability has been finally determined. While it
is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these
proceedings, in the opinion of management, any payments the
Company may be required to make as a result of currently existing
 claims will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or the business of the Company as a whole.

Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Item  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF
SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders of Harris
 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.



EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT (As of August 31, 2000).



There is no family relationship between any of the Company’s
 executive officers or directors, and there are no arrangements
or understandings between any of the Company’s executive
officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any
of them was elected as an officer or director, other than
arrangements or understandings with directors or officers of the
Company acting solely in their capacities as such.

All of the Company’s executive officers are elected annually
 and serve at the pleasure of the board of directors.



PART II

Item 5.                             
 MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

Harris Corporation Common Stock, par value $1 per share, is
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS,” and
is also traded on the Boston, Chicago, Pacific and Philadelphia
Stock Exchanges and through the Intermarket Trading System. As of
 August 25, 2000, there were approximately 9,817 holders of
record of the Common Stock.

The high and low sales prices as reported in the consolidated
transaction reporting system and the dividends paid on the Common
 Stock for each quarterly period in the last two fiscal years are
 reported below:

On August 25, 2000, the last sale price of the Harris Common
 Stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting
system was $29.125 per share.

On August 26, 2000, the board declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.05 per share which will be paid on
September 22, 2000 to holders of record on September 8,
 2000. The Company has paid cash dividends every year since 1941
and currently expects that cash dividends will continue to be
paid in the future. Following the spin-off of Lanier, Harris
reduced its annual dividend rate from $0.96 per share to its
current annual level of $0.20 per share. The declaration of
dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of
factors, including Harris’ financial condition, capital
requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant.

On October 22, 1999, the board authorized the Company to
repurchase up to 15,000,000 shares of its Common Stock
periodically in the open-market, in negotiated or block
transactions or pursuant to tender offers. During fiscal year
2000, the Company repurchased approximately 10.7 million of
its shares in open-market transactions.

On August 23, 1997, the board of directors of Harris
approved a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record at
the close of business on September 4, 1997. All share
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been
restated to reflect the stock split.



Item  6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The following table summarizes selected historical financial

Item  7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis provides information that
management believes is useful in understanding Harris’
operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The
discussion is based on Harris’ continuing operations and
should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements
and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Except for
the historical information contained here, the discussions in
this document contain forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Harris’ actual results could differ
 materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause
or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to, those discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements”
below.

Results of Operations

On November 5, 1999, Harris completed the spin-off of its
Lanier Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an independent, publicly
owned company. Additionally, on August 13, 1999, Harris
completed the sale of substantially all of its semiconductor
business. As a result of these actions, the Lanier and
semiconductor businesses are presented as discontinued operations
 for all periods presented. Continuing operations are reported
under two segments: the Government Communications segment, which
is comprised of the operations of the former Electronic Systems
Sector, and the Commercial Communications segment, which is
comprised of the operations of the former Communications Sector.
The following discussion is on a continuing operations basis.

Restructuring

In fiscal 2000, Harris recorded a $41 million charge ($26.7
million after income tax) for the restructuring of its
operations. Restructuring actions included a reduction in
workforce of approximately 161 employees and provisions for the
write-down of intangible assets, equipment, and other assets
associated with the exit from Harris’ telephone switching
and alarm management product lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161 switching business
employees were notified that their employment would be terminated
 and what their specific severance benefits would be. These
employees worked in the marketing, sales, manufacturing, and
administrative areas and were primarily located in Marin County,
California. As of June 30, 2000, 62 employees had been
terminated with the balance to be terminated by
September 30, 2000.

In June 2000, Harris sold the core switch business to Teltronics,
 Inc. Harris also sold the alarm management business to Mediation
 Technology Corporation in August 2000. Harris also intends
to sell other portions of this product line, including the
international activities, during fiscal 2001. Gains or losses
from the sale of these operations are included or will be
included in restructuring expenses in the period the sale occurs.
 Estimated discounted cash flows were used in determining the
fair value of assets and liabilities in recording the
restructuring charge.

Cash outlays for restructuring actions will be primarily for
severance benefits. Harris expects to pay these benefits ratably
over the first two quarters of fiscal 2001 from currently
available cash sources. Sales from these product lines were $73.5
 million in 2000, $126.6 million in 1999, and $140.4 million in
1998. Operating losses from these product lines were
$18.9 million in 2000, $3.6 million in 1999, and
$2.9 million in 1998.

In fiscal 1999, Harris recorded a $5.1 million charge ($3.3
million after income tax) for severance costs associated with the
 restructuring of Harris. In connection with this restructuring,
Harris identified employee reductions of 606, all of which
occurred during fiscal 2000.

Harris does not anticipate any further restructuring charges with
 respect to the items noted above in fiscal 2001 other than gains
 or losses that may result from the sale of the exited product
lines or restructuring noted above. For further information, see
the

“Restructuring”

footnote in the Notes to
Financial Statements.



Purchased In-Process Research and Development

In January 2000, Harris purchased Louth Automation, a
leading supplier of advanced automation systems for radio and
television broadcasters. Harris paid cash in the net amount of
approximately $87 million. The final determination of the
purchase price is subject to adjustment.

In connection with the acquisition, Harris allocated $10.7
million of the purchase price to in-process research and
development projects. This allocation represents the estimated
fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the
incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the development
of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility
and the in-process research and development had no alternative
future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as a one-time
 charge to earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2000.

In making the purchase price allocation to in-process research
and development, Harris relied on present value calculations of
income, an analysis of project accomplishments and completion
costs, and an assessment of overall contribution and project
risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process research and
development were determined by identifying significant research
projects for which technological feasibility had not been
established. The fair values assigned to each of the significant
projects and the stage of completion are reported below:

A discussion of the three most significant projects follows:

Version 9.5 of the Automated Device Controller
(“ADC”) Software:

•

Base ADC product is an all-purpose program/commercial automation
	system with the ability to integrate a wide variety of broadcast
	devices.

•

Version 9.5 provides a link between traffic, engineering, and
	on-air broadcasting operations.

•

The primary functions under development include:

•

The development of Version 9.5 was initiated in early calendar
	1998 (conceptualization of features, etc.).

•

The amount of completion is estimated at 80% (considering
	time-based, cost-based, and milestone-based completion measures).

•

Version 9.5 incorporates significant leverage on existing
	technology from ADC version 9.4. The degree of leverage was
	estimated to be 50%.



Media Browser:

News:

The value assigned to purchased in-process research and
development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the
 purchased in-process research and development into commercially
viable products and discounting the net cash flows to their
present value using a discount rate of 28 percent.

Remaining development efforts for these in-process research and
development projects include various phases of design,
development, and testing. The anticipated completion dates for
the in-process research and development projects will occur
within the next twelve months, after which Harris expects to
begin generating economic benefits from the technologies over a
seven-year life cycle. Expenditures to complete these projects
are expected to total $0.9 million.

These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties of
 the development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. We expect to
continue these development efforts and believe we have a
reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and
development programs. However, there is a risk associated with
the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any
 will attain either technological or commercial success.

Fiscal 2000 Compared with 1999

Revenue and Operating Income by Segment

Revenue for fiscal 2000 was $1,807.4 million, an increase of
3.7 percent compared to the prior year. Operating income in
fiscal 2000 was $36.3 million versus $74.5 million for the prior
year.



Segment revenue and operating income were as follows:

(1)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $41 million restructuring expense and a
	$10.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research and
	development. Fiscal 1999 includes a $20.6 million special charge
	for a litigation settlement.

(2)

Fiscal 1999 includes a $5.1 million restructuring expense.

(3)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $21.9 million gain from the sale of
	Intersil Holding Corporation stock.

Government Communications Segment:

Government
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2000 increased
0.3 percent from the prior year, and operating income
increased 11.5 percent. These results were impacted by an
$18.0 million write-off in fiscal 1999 for the settlement of
claims and unrecoverable contract development costs on two
contracts. Excluding this write-off, revenues declined one
percent and operating income declined 17.1 percent from
fiscal 1999. Despite improved operating margins on more recent
contract awards in 2000, operating income has been impacted by
margin pressure from poorer-performing older contracts. Revenue
growth and operating income improved significantly in the fourth
quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2000. Backlog
continued to build reflecting a robust win rate percentage and
increased spending by the U.S. government for defense.

Commercial Communications Segment:

Commercial
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2000 increased
6.6 percent over 1999. Excluding sales from the recently
exited telephone switching product line, the Commercial
Communications segment’s sales increased from $803.7 million
 to $918.0 million, or 14.2 percent. This segment
experienced double-digit growth in all four of the segment’s
 major continuing commercial product lines: microwave, network
support, broadcast, and tactical radio. These revenue increases
were partially offset by a 41.9 percent decrease in revenue
from the recently exited telephone switching and alarm management
 product lines.

The segment’s operating loss for 2000 was impacted by the
$41.0 million restructuring charge and the $10.7 million
purchased in-process research and development write-off mentioned
 previously, as well as a $12.0 million write-down of inventory
related to the telephone switching and alarm management product
lines that were exited. These product lines also incurred an
additional $18.9 million in operating losses in 2000 compared to
a loss of $3.6 million in 1999. The segment’s fiscal 2000
operating loss also includes transition costs of $16.5 million
associated with exiting these product lines. Such costs included
relocation of the network support business unit’s
headquarters from Marin County, California to Melbourne, Florida;
 collection losses on accounts receivable; and excess
manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in Marin County.
Harris ceased all marketing, sales, and research and development
for the telephone switching and alarm management



product lines as of February 2000. The operating losses
through February 2000 included a significant amount of
marketing and sales expenses, as well as research and development
 costs in the telephone switching product line.

Excluding the items mentioned above in both the current and prior
 year, as well as a $20.6 million special charge for a patent
litigation settlement in the prior year, the Commercial
Communications segment’s operating income increased from
$58.3 million in 1999 to $65.8 million in 2000, or
12.9 percent. The increase in operating income was driven
mainly by the 14.2 percent sales growth in the Commercial
Communications segment’s continuing commercial product
lines.

Orders and revenue increased for microwave radios during the year
 as markets continued to rebound in North America, Latin America,
 and China. In June 2000, Harris completed the acquisition
of the point-to-point microwave business of TRT Lucent
Technologies. The acquisition provides for a five-year preferred
supplier agreement to serve the worldwide point-to-point
microwave needs of Lucent’s wireless divisions.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, Harris also entered into
agreements to acquire Wavtrace, Inc., a privately-held, leading
developer of broadband wireless access systems. The acquisition
when completed is expected to support Harris’ initiative to
lead the world in the delivery of point-to-point and
point-to-multipoint broadband wireless access solutions for
microwave and millimeter wave frequencies.

The broadcast communications business reported a strong increase
in revenues due primarily to its new studio automation business,
which was bolstered by the purchase of Louth Automation, the
leading supplier of advanced automation systems for digital
television, over-the-air broadcast, and cable and industrial
applications. The acquisition of Louth Automation brings
competencies in automation and control to complement Harris’
 leadership position in broadcast transmission and digital
encoding. This acquisition further broadens Harris’ global
position in the broadcast markets.

The tactical radio product line experienced a significant
increase in sales as it continues to benefit from the
market’s enthusiasm for its high data rate, multiband,
secure radios which were introduced in fiscal 2000 to meet the
growing bandwidth requirement as digital technology is embraced
by the military.

Orders and revenues also increased substantially for the network
support business. This increase was aided by increased demand for
 the telecom line test systems used by competitive local exchange
 carriers (CLECs) to deploy digital subscriber lines (DSLs) for
applications such as high-speed Internet service and other
broadband communication services for voice, data, and video.



Comparative Statement of Income

Harris’ comparative statement of income is as follows:

Gross Margin:

The gross margin as a percent of revenue was
 25.2 percent in fiscal 2000 compared to 26.7 percent
in 1999. The decline in gross margins was primarily due to a
$12.0 million write-down of inventory and lower gross margin
related to the telephone switching product line that was exited.

Excluding the impact of this exited product line, gross margin as
 a percent of revenue was 26.2 percent in 2000 compared to
25.8 percent in 1999. The increase is due to improved gross
margins in Harris’ Commercial Communications segment’s
broadcast, network support, and microwave radio product lines.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses:

Engineering, selling, and administrative expenses as a percent of
 revenue were 22.4 percent in fiscal 2000 versus
21.8 percent in 1999. Fiscal 2000 operating expenses were
impacted by $16.5 million of transition costs associated with
exiting the telephone switching product line. Such costs include
relocation of the network support business unit’s
headquarters from Marin County, California to Melbourne, Florida;
 collection losses on accounts receivable; and excess
manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in Marin County. The
 operating expenses were also impacted by administrative and
general, marketing and sales, and research and development
expenses in the telephone switching product line in the first
half of the fiscal year.

Excluding the impact of the exited product line, operating
expenses as a percent of revenue were 20.6 percent in 2000
versus 20.3 percent in 1999. The increase was primarily due
to planned increases in selling and engineering, research and
development expenses, as well as increased headquarters expenses.
 The increased headquarters expenses were primarily attributable
to unusually low executive compensation in fiscal 1999 and costs
associated with the centralization of company-wide shared
services in fiscal 2000.

Goodwill Amortization:

Goodwill amortization
increased from $4.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $10.5 million in
fiscal 2000. The increase was due to acquisitions made in
Harris’ broadcast systems product line during fiscal 2000,
primarily the acquisition of Louth Automation.



Other Income:

Other income increased from $19.3
million in 1999 to $48.2 million in 2000 due primarily to a $21.9
 million gain from the sale of one million shares of Intersil
Holding Corporation stock as a part of Intersil Holding
Corporation’s initial public offering. The remaining
increase was due to gains on the sale and redemption of other
securities partially offset by lower income from Harris’
equity investments.

Interest Income and Interest Expense:

Interest
income increased from $13.3 million in 1999 to $27.4 million in
2000 due to higher cash balances that resulted from the sale of
the semiconductor business and the spin-off of Lanier Worldwide,
Inc. Interest expense increased from $9.8 million in 1999 to
$25.2 million in 2000 due to a higher allocation of interest
expense to the results of discontinued operations in the prior
year. Total interest expense from both continuing operations and
discontinued operations decreased from $84.0 million in 1999 to
$41.7 million in 2000. This decrease is due to the repayment of
short-term debt with the cash received from the sale of the
semiconductor business and the spin-off of Lanier Worldwide, Inc.
 and lower interest rates.

Income Taxes:

The provision for income taxes as a
percentage of pretax income was 35.0 percent in fiscal 2000
versus 36.0 percent in the prior year. Both 2000 and 1999
benefited from tax rates on foreign source income and export
sales, which offset the additional provision needed for state
income taxes.

Return on Revenue:

Income from continuing operations
 as a percentage of revenue was 1.4 percent in 2000 versus
2.9 percent in 1999. The reduction was primarily due to
restructuring expenses, purchased in-process research and
development, and the transition costs and operating losses of
exited product lines which were partially offset by the gain from
 sales of Intersil Holding Corporation stock. Excluding these
items, income from continuing operations as a percentage of
revenue increased from 4.2 percent in 1999 to
4.3 percent in 2000.

Selected financial information relating to geographical regions
and export sales is set forth in the note

“Business
Segments”

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Fiscal 1999 Compared with 1998

Net Sales and Operating Income:

Revenue from product
 sales and services decreased 9.4 percent to $1.74 billion
in fiscal 1999, from $1.92 billion in fiscal 1998. Income from
continuing operations before extraordinary item was $49.9
million, down 24.8 percent from $66.4 million in fiscal
1998. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item
 in fiscal 1999 included a restructuring charge for employee
reductions of $5.1 million, a one-time $20.6 million charge for
litigation costs for the settlement of a patent litigation
relating to an older product no longer manufactured by the
Company, and an $18.0 million charge for settlement of claims and
 unrecoverable contract development costs on two contracts.
Prior-year income from continuing operations includes $16.1
million of restructuring expenses and a $12.0 million provision
for costs associated with a Malaysian contract. Excluding all of
the above items for both years, income from continuing operations
 declined approximately 8 percent in fiscal 1999.

Net sales for the Government Communications segment in fiscal
1999 were $813.2 million, 14.5 percent lower than the prior
year, while operating profit increased 18.7 percent to $52.1
 million. Excluding prior year restructuring charges and unusual
long-term contract charges in both years ($18.0 million in fiscal
 1999 and $19.8 million in fiscal 1998), operating profit
increased 10.0 percent in fiscal 1999. Lower sales in the
segment’s information systems and aerospace systems product
lines more than offset growth in the communications systems
product line. Lower sales in information systems and aerospace
systems was primarily attributable to declining order backlog.
The increase in operating profit was related to final settlement
of prior year’s overhead rates and to increased gross
margins resulting from a more favorable contract mix.

Commercial Communications segment sales decreased
4.5 percent to $930.3 million in fiscal 1999, from $973.7
million in fiscal 1998. Excluding a fiscal 1999 one-time $20.6
million charge for litigation costs and a fiscal 1998
restructuring charge of $8.3 million, operating profit declined
19.9 percent to $54.7 million from $68.3 million in fiscal
1998. Significantly lower sales and gross margins in the
segment’s microwave radio and digital switch product lines
offset modest improvement in sales and earnings for the
segment’s broadcast equipment product line. Lower sales in
the microwave product lines resulted primarily from weak
international



markets and lower than expected PCS growth in the North American
market. As a result, overcapacity in the industry caused severe
pricing pressures and margin erosion. There also was a
significant reduction in foreign sales for digital switch
products. Sales for the segment’s radio communication
product line were marginally higher than the prior year while
operating profit was relatively unchanged.

Cost of Sales and Services:

Cost of sales and
services was $1.28 billion in fiscal 1999. Costs as a percentage
of sales decreased from 75.0 percent in fiscal 1998 to
73.3 percent in fiscal 1999. The decrease was primarily
attributable to improved gross margins in the Company’s
Government Communications segment which were partially offset by
the decline in the gross margins in the Commercial Communications
 segment.

Operating Expenses:

Engineering, selling, and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
22 percent in 1999, up slightly from 21.9 percent in
the prior year. Higher expenditures for marketing and
Company-sponsored research and development were offset by lower
administrative expenses for the year. Headquarters expense, which
 is included in administrative expenses, was $28.4 million lower
than fiscal 1998 due to lower expenses associated with the
employee benefit plans and a continued emphasis on cost controls.

Other Income and Expense:

Interest expense was lower
 in fiscal 1999 due to a lower level of borrowings from
continuing operations in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998.
Interest expense is allocated to the Company’s discontinued
operations based upon the capital employed by the business.
Interest expense before allocations to discontinued operations
increased from $73.2 million to $84.0 million due to higher
borrowings and higher interest rates.

“Other income” was $38.3 million lower in fiscal 1999
due primarily to lower amounts of gains from the sale of
investment securities and lower royalty income compared to fiscal
 1998.

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations as a
percentage of income before income taxes was 36.0 percent in
 both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998. The increase from the
statutory U.S. income tax rate of 35.0 percent in both years
 was due primarily to provisions for state income taxes.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Harris’ comparative financial position is as follows:

Cash and marketable securities:

Harris completed
several transactions that resulted in significant cash receipts
including $520 million from the sale of it semiconductor business
 to Intersil Corporation, $546 million from the Lanier Worldwide,
 Inc. spin-off, and $120 million from the payment of a note and
the sale of Intersil Holding Corporation shares as a result of
the initial public offering of Intersil Holding Corporation.
Harris has used a portion of this cash to reduce total debt by
$347.7 million, to repurchase Harris’ Common Stock, and



for other general corporate purposes, such as the acquisitions of
 Louth Automation and TRT Lucent Technologies’
point-to-point microwave radio business.

Harris plans to use its remaining cash balances for similar
general corporate purposes in the future, such as acquisitions
and repurchases of its Common Stock.

Marketable securities increased from $15.5 million as of
July 2, 1999 to $432.5 million as of June 30, 2000. The
 increase was primarily due to Harris’ holdings in Intersil
Holding Corporation and AirNet Communications Corporation, each
of which completed initial public offerings during fiscal 2000.

Harris also has available a $500 million syndicated credit
facility and a $500 million shelf registration. Management
currently believes that existing cash, funds generated from
operations, sales of marketable securities, the credit facility,
and access to the public debt markets will be sufficient to
provide for Harris’ anticipated requirements for working
capital, capital expenditures, and any additional stock
repurchases under the current repurchase program for the next
twelve months.

Working capital:

Working capital increased $849.0
million from $224.1 million as of July 2, 1999 to $1,073.1
million as of June 30, 2000. Also, total debt decreased from
 $838.7 million to $491.0 million for the same periods. These
changes were largely due to a $292.5 million increase in cash and
 cash equivalents, a $248.1 million decrease in short-term debt
due to the sale of Harris’ semiconductor operation and the
spin-off of Lanier Worldwide, Inc., and a $417.0 million increase
 in marketable securities noted above. These increases were
partially offset by a $142.9 million change in current deferred
income taxes related primarily to unrealized gains on marketable
securities, increased receivables due to more extended terms in
Harris’ Commercial Communications segment, and a decrease in
 accounts payable.

Intangibles resulting from acquisitions:

Intangibles
 resulting from acquisitions increased from $72.8 million as
 of July 2, 1999 to $166.2 million as of June 30, 2000.
 The increase was due primarily to goodwill recorded as a result
of the Louth Automation acquisition and intellectual property
associated with the TRT Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point
microwave radio business acquisition.

Non-current deferred income taxes:

The liability for
 non-current deferred income taxes was $14.1 million as of
June 30, 2000 versus $47.3 million as of July 2, 1999.
The decrease was due primarily to lower amounts of timing
differences related to accruals and depreciation partially offset
 by more timing differences related to international tax loss
carryforwards.

Total debt and capitalization:

At June 30,
2000, debt totaled $491.0 million, representing 26.3 percent
 of total capital (defined as the sum of total debt plus
shareholders’ equity). A year earlier, debt of $838.7
million was 34.5 percent of total capital. Cash received from the
 sale of Harris’ semiconductor operation and the spin-off of
 Lanier Worldwide, Inc. was used to decrease the debt balance.
Year-end long-term debt included $350.0 million of debentures,
$30.5 million of notes payable to banks, and $2.1 million of
other long-term debt.

In 2000, Harris issued 161,545 shares of Common Stock to
employees under the terms of Harris’ stock purchase, option,
 and incentive plans.

Harris’ debt is currently rated “BBB” by Standard
and Poor’s Ratings Group and “Baa1” by
Moody’s Investors Service. Harris expects to maintain
operating ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios, and balance sheet
 ratios sufficient for retention of these debt ratings.

Purchase of Common Stock for Treasury:

Harris used
$232.8 million to repurchase 10.7 million shares of its Common
Stock in fiscal 2000 compared to $15.7 million to purchase 0.4
million shares in fiscal 1999. Harris’ board of directors
has approved a share repurchase program which authorizes the
repurchase of up to 15 million shares through open market
transactions, in negotiated block transactions or pursuant to
tender offers.

Additions of Plant and Equipment:

Additions of plant
 and equipment for 2000 were $81.3 million versus $60.4 million
in 1999. The increase is due to the purchase of a new
headquarters building for Harris’ broadcast communications
operation in Mason, Ohio and the buyout of a lease on a PC board
manufacturing plant in San Antonio, Texas. Harris has outsourced
this manufacturing process and is leasing the space to the new
manufacturer. Total additions for Harris in fiscal 2001 are
expected to be approximately $80 million.



Retirement Plans

Retirement benefits for substantially all of Harris’
employees are provided primarily through a retirement plan having
 profit sharing and savings elements. Harris also provides
limited health-care benefits to retirees who have 10 or more
years of service. All obligations under Harris’ retirement
plans have been fully funded by Harris’ contributions, the
provision for which totaled $37.4 million in fiscal 2000.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 50 percent of Harris’ international
business is transacted in local currency environments. The impact
 of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
 U.S. dollars is included as a component of shareholders’
equity. At June 30, 2000, the cumulative translation
adjustment reduced shareholders’ equity by $16.5 million
compared to a reduction of $11.7 million at July 2, 1999.

Harris utilizes foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize
the currency risk of international transactions. Gains and losses
 resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a
material effect on Harris’ results in 2000, 1999, or 1998.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, Harris has consistently followed the
practice of adjusting its prices to reflect the impact of
inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
cost of purchased materials and services.

Market Risk Management

Harris, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the
 risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates,
fluctuations in the market value of its equity securities
available for sale, and changes in interest rates. Harris employs
 established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks.

Harris uses foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
balance sheet and off-balance sheet foreign currency commitments.
 Specifically, these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign
currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from
suppliers, and accounts receivable from and future committed
sales to customers, and intercompany loans. Management believes
the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce
the risks, which arise from doing business in international
markets. Contracts are generally one year or less. At
June 30, 2000, Harris had open foreign exchange contracts
with a notional amount of $28.5 million, of which $4.0 million
were to hedge off-balance sheet commitments. At July 2,
1999, Harris had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $37.0 million, of which $7.7 million was to hedge
off-balance sheet commitments. Additionally, for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000, Harris purchased and sold $432.3
million of foreign exchange forward and option contracts,
compared to $366.1 million for the comparable prior year period.
Harris’ hedging activities provide only limited protection
against currency exchange risks. Factors that could impact the
effectiveness of Harris’ hedging programs include accuracy
of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets, and the cost
and availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent
adverse change in currency exchange rates for Harris’
foreign currency derivatives held at June 30, 2000 would
have an impact of approximately $1.7 million on the fair value of
 such instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market
risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does
not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the
fair value of Harris’ foreign denominated assets,
liabilities and firm commitments.

Harris also maintains a portfolio of marketable equity securities
 available for sale. These investments result from the retained
interest in sold or spun-off businesses and the investment in
start-up companies that have technology or products that are of
interest to Harris. The fair market value of these securities at
June 30, 2000 was $432.5 million, compared to $15.5 million
as of July 2, 1999. This increase was due to the initial
public offerings of two of these investments and an increase in
these securities’ quoted market prices. The corresponding
unrealized gain is included as a component of shareholders’
equity. These investments have historically had higher volatility
 than most market indices. A 10 percent adverse change in
the quoted market



price of marketable equity securities would have an impact of
approximately $43.3 million on the fair market value of these
securities.

Harris utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both
 fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage its exposures to
changes in interest rates. Harris does not expect changes in
interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows
in fiscal 2001, although there can be no assurances that interest
 rates will not significantly change.

Environmental Matters

Harris is actively engaged in complying with environmental
protection laws. In addition to ongoing internal compliance
programs, an estimated $0.1 million was spent on environmental
capital projects in fiscal 2000 and $0.3 million in fiscal 1999.
Harris estimates that it will authorize $0.1 million in fiscal
2001 for environmental-related capital projects. Under the
Superfund Act or similar state environmental laws, Harris also
has potential liability at various waste sites designated for
clean-up. Harris is named as a potentially responsible party at
eleven such sites where future liabilities could exist. These
sites include two Harris-owned sites, four sites associated with
former Harris locations, and five non-Harris owned treatment or
disposal sites, allegedly containing hazardous substances
attributable to Harris from past operations. Harris routinely
assesses its contingencies, obligations, and commitments to clean
 up and monitor sites in light of in-depth studies, analysis by
environmental experts, and legal reviews. At the two Harris-owned
 sites and four sites associated with former Harris locations,
Harris is involved primarily in monitoring and remediation
programs that have been implemented in cooperation with various
environmental agencies. At the other sites, Harris is involved as
 one of numerous potentially responsible parties (PRPs). In
ascertaining environmental exposures, management must assess the
extent of contamination, the nature of remedial actions,
continually evolving governmental standards, and the number,
participation level, and financial viability of other PRPs and
other similar variables. Based upon internal and third-party
studies, as well as the remediation and monitoring expense
history at the two Harris-owned sites and four sites associated
with former Harris locations, the number and solvency of PRPs at
the other sites, and an assessment of other relevant factors,
Harris has estimated that its discounted liability under the
Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
for identified sites, using a 9.5 percent discount rate, is
approximately $5.5 million. Harris has accrued these discounted
liabilities. The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will
 be incurred over the next 20 to 25 years (depending on the
number of years for each site) is approximately $11.1 million.
The expected payments for the next five years are:
2001 — $1.4 million; 2002 — $0.9 million;
2003 — $0.6 million; 2004 — $0.6 million;
2005 — $0.6 million; and the aggregate amount
thereafter is approximately $7.0 million.

Year 2000 Issue

The Year 2000 statements set forth below are designated as
“Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures” pursuant to the Year
2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

Certain software and hardware systems are time sensitive. Older
time-sensitive systems often use a two-digit dating convention
(e.g., “00” rather than “2000”) that could
result in system failure and disruption of operations in 2000 and
 later years.

During the past several years Harris diligently addressed the
potential Year 2000 problem by undertaking 235 remediation
project initiatives relating to four basic aspects of Harris and
its business operations: (1) internal information technology
 systems, including sales order processing, contract management,
financial systems, and service management; (2) internal
non-information technology systems, including office equipment
and test equipment; (3) products and services; and
(4) material third-party relationships. Harris completed all
 these initiatives at the originally estimated cost of
$20 million dollars. This cost was generally not incremental
 to existing information technology budgets.

Harris did not experience any significant business disruptions or
 system failures as a result of Year 2000 issues. Further, there
have been no substantial Year 2000 related issues reported from
our major suppliers or customers.



Although the Year 2000 event has occurred, and while there can be
 no assurance that there will be no problems related to the Year
2000 for a period of time after January 1, 2000, Harris
believes it has not and will not be adversely impacted by Year
2000 issues.

Outlook

The outlook for fiscal 2001 is for strong growth in sales and
earnings, building on the momentum established during the past
year. The major repositioning actions have been completed,
yielding reductions in overhead costs and much tighter
integration of Harris. Although profit margins are low by
historical standards as Harris ends the repositioning period,
Harris expects to see continued improvement, quarter by quarter,
during the coming year. Harris also expects to accomplish
additional acquisitions to further strengthen Harris’
position in markets that it serves.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000

HARRIS CORPORATION

MELBOURNE, FLORIDA



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Harris Directors and Shareholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000
and July 2, 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
 income, cash flows and comprehensive income and
shareholders’ equity for each of the three fiscal years in
the period ended June 30, 2000. Our audits also include the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits. The financial
statements of GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC and subsidiaries
 (a company in which the Corporation has a 49% interest), have
been audited by other auditors, whose report has been furnished
to us; insofar as our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended July 2, 1999,
relates to data included for GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC
and subsidiaries, it is based solely on their report.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
auditors (as of and for the year ended July 2, 1999), the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Harris
Corporation and subsidiaries at June 30, 2000 and
July 2, 1999, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended June 30, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth herein.

Notes to Financial Statements

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

— The consolidated financial statements
 include the accounts of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries
(“Harris”). These statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and require management to make estimates and
assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated.

Fiscal Year

— Harris’ fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest
June 30. Fiscal Years 2000 and 1999 include 52 weeks,
while the 1998 fiscal year includes 53 weeks.

Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents are temporary cash investments with
 a maturity of three months or less when purchased. These
investments include accrued interest and are carried at the lower
 of cost or market.

Marketable Securities

— Marketable equity securities are stated at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included as
a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Realized gains
 and losses from marketable securities are determined using the
specific identification method. The cost basis of marketable
securities was $63.5 million at June 30, 2000, and $3.9
million at July 2, 1999. The proceeds from the sale of
marketable securities was $52.6 million in 2000, $9.9 million in
1999, and $39.6 million in 1998. The amount of gross realized
gains included in “Other income” was $49.6 million in
2000, $9.6 million in 1999, and $38.8 million in 1998. The fiscal
 2000 gross realized gains included a $21.9 million gain from the
 sale of one million shares of Intersil Holding Corporation stock
 as a part of Intersil Holding Corporation’s initial public
offering.

Inventories

— Inventories are priced at the lower of cost
(determined by average and first-in, first-out methods) or
market.

Plant and Equipment

— Plant and equipment are carried on the basis of
cost. Depreciation of buildings, machinery and equipment is
computed by the straight-line and accelerated methods. The
estimated useful lives of buildings range between 5 and
50 years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and
equipment range between 3 and 10 years.

Intangibles

— Intangibles resulting from acquisitions are being
amortized by the straight-line method principally over 10 to
15 years. Recoverability of intangibles is assessed using
estimated undiscounted cash flows of related operations.
Intangibles that are not expected to be recovered through future
undiscounted cash flows are charged to expense when identified.
Amounts charged to expense are amounts in excess of the fair
value of the intangible asset. Fair value is determined as the
present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.

Income Taxes

— Harris follows the liability method of accounting
for income taxes.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenue is recognized from sales other than on
long-term contracts when a product is shipped, from rentals as
they accrue, and from services when performed. Unearned income on
 service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method over
the term of the contracts.

Revenue and anticipated profits under long-term
contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis,
generally using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales
 and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to
 estimated total costs at completion. Contracts are combined when
 specific aggregation criteria are met. Criteria generally
include closely interrelated activities performed for a single
customer within the same economic environment. Contracts
generally are not segmented.

Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items are included in sales only when they can be
 reliably estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or
penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are
considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded
 when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated
contract performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or
decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event, are
 generally not recognized until the event occurs.

When adjustments in contract value or estimated
costs are determined, any changes from prior estimates are
reflected in earnings in the current period. Anticipated losses
on contracts or programs in progress are charged to earnings when
 identified.

Royalty income is included as a component of
“Other income” and is recognized on the basis of terms
specified in contractual agreements.

Retirement Benefits

— Harris and its subsidiaries provide retirement
benefits to substantially all employees primarily through a
retirement plan having profit-sharing and savings elements.
Contributions by Harris to the retirement plan are based on
profits and employees’ savings with no other funding
requirements. Harris may make additional contributions to the
fund at its discretion.

Retirement benefits also include an unfunded
limited healthcare plan for U.S. based retirees and employees on
long-term disability. Harris accrues the estimated cost of these
medical benefits, which are not material, during an
employee’s active service life.

Environmental Expenditures

— Harris capitalizes environmental
expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. Harris
accrues environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions
 that relate to past operations when the costs are probable and
reasonably estimable.

Based on an assessment of relevant factors, Harris
 has estimated that its discounted liability under the Superfund
Act and other environmental statutes and regulations for
identified sites, using a 9.5 percent discount rate, is
approximately $5.5 million. This liability is accrued in the
June 30, 2000 consolidated balance sheet. The expected
aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next
 20 to 25 years (depending on the number of years for each
site)



Notes to Financial Statements

is approximately $11.1 million. The expected
payments for the next five years are: 2001 — $1.4
million; 2002 — $0.9 million; 2003 — $0.6
million; 2004 — $0.6 million; 2005 — $0.6
million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is approximately
$7.0 million.

Futures and Forward Contracts

— When Harris sells products outside
the United States or enters into purchase commitments,
transactions are sometimes denominated in currencies other than
U.S. dollars. To minimize the impact on revenue and cost from
currency fluctuations, Harris enters into currency exchange
agreements that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is
Harris’ policy not to speculate in foreign currencies.
Currency exchange agreements are designated as, and are effective
 as, hedges of foreign currency assets and liabilities. In
addition, these agreements are consistent with the designated
currency of the underlying asset or liability. Gains and losses
on currency exchange agreements that qualify as hedges are
deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the carrying amount
of the hedged asset or liability. Gains and losses on currency
exchange agreements that do not qualify as hedges are recognized
in income based on changes in the fair market value of the
currency exchange agreement.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional currency for most
international subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange, and
income and expense items are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation adjustments
 are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’
equity.

Unearned Compensation

— Compensation resulting from performance shares
granted under Harris’ long-term incentive plan is amortized
to expense over the performance period and is adjusted for
changes in the market value of Harris’ Common Stock.

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each year.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified on
 the financial statements to conform with current year
classifications.

Stock Split

On August 23, 1997, the Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record on
 September 4, 1997. All references in the financial
statements and notes to financial statements to number of shares,
 per share amounts, and market prices of Harris’ Common
Stock have been restated to reflect the increased number of
shares outstanding.

Accounting Changes

In February 1998, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. This SOP requires capitalization of
certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use
software, including external direct material and service costs,
employee payroll and payroll-related costs, and interest. Harris
has adopted SOP 98-1 for fiscal 2000. The adoption did not have a
 material effect on Harris’ financial statements.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”),
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities.
It requires an entity to recognize that all derivatives are
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure
those investments at fair value. Implementation of this standard
has been delayed by the FASB for a twelve-month period. Harris
will be required to adopt SFAS 133 in the first quarter of
fiscal 2001. This will not have a material effect on Harris’
 results of operations or financial position.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange
 Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101 (“SAB 101”), “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB 101
summarizes the SEC’s views in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements. Harris is required to adopt SAB 101 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Management does not believe the
adoption of SAB 101 will have a material effect on Harris’
results of operations or financial position.

Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 1999, Harris decided to sell its
semiconductor business and spin off its Lanier Worldwide, Inc.
subsidiary. Accordingly, the results of operations and the net
assets of these business segments have been reclassified as
discontinued operations.

On August 13, 1999, Harris completed the sale
 of substantially all of its semiconductor business to Intersil
Corporation and its affiliates. Intersil Corporation was a newly
formed company owned by Sterling Holding Company, LLC, a Citicorp
 Venture Capital Ltd. investment portfolio company, along with
certain management investors, and affiliates of Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of
land, buildings, equipment, inventory, receivables, technology,
and other assets related to the operation of the semiconductor
business.

In addition to acquiring a 10 percent equity
interest in Intersil Holding Corporation for which Harris paid $9
 million, Harris received cash of $520 million, a promissory note
 of $90 million, and Intersil Corporation assumed certain
liabilities. Harris also retained receivables and patent rights.
Harris recorded an after-tax loss of $76 million for the disposal
 of its entire semiconductor business including the portion sold
to Intersil Corporation. Intersil Holding Corporation undertook
an initial public offering (IPO) in February, 2000. At that time,
 the promissory note was paid as was the accrued interest. Harris
 also participated in the IPO and sold one million of its
Intersil Holding Corporation shares at a gain of $21.9 million.



Notes to Financial Statements

On October 22, 1999, Harris announced that
its Board of Directors formally approved the spin-off of its
Lanier Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an independent publicly
traded company. The Board declared a dividend of one share of
Lanier common stock for each share of Harris Common Stock to
Harris shareholders of record on November 1, 1999. The
distribution of the dividend was completed on November 5,
1999. Harris retained approximately 10 percent of the
outstanding shares of Lanier.

Summarized financial information for the
discontinued operations follows:

The information set forth in the remaining notes
to the financial statements relates to continuing operations
unless otherwise specified.

Restructuring

In fiscal 2000, Harris recorded a $41 million
charge ($26.7 million after income tax) for the restructuring of
its operations. Restructuring actions include a reduction of
approximately 161 employees and provisions for the write-down of
intangible assets, equipment, and other assets associated with
the exit from Harris’ Commercial Communications
Segment’s telephone switching and alarm management product
lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161 switching
 business employees were notified that their employment would be
terminated and what their specific severance benefit would be.
These employees worked in the marketing, sales, manufacturing,
and administrative areas and were primarily located in Marin
County, California. As of June 30, 2000, 62 employees had
been terminated with the balance to be terminated by
September 30, 2000.

In June of 2000, Harris sold the core switch
business to Teltronics, Inc. Harris also intends to sell other
portions of this product line, including the alarm management and
 international activities, during fiscal 2001. Gains or losses
from the sale of these operations are included or will be
included in restructuring expenses in the period the sale occurs.
 Estimated discounted cash flows were used in determining the
fair value of assets and liabilities in recording the
restructuring charge.

Cash outlays for restructuring actions will be
primarily for severance benefits. Harris expects to pay these
benefits ratably over the first two quarters of fiscal 2001 from
currently available cash sources. Sales from this product line
were $73.5 million in 2000, $126.6 million in 1999, and $140.4
million in 1998. Operating losses from these product lines were
$18.9 million in 2000, $3.6 million in 1999, and $2.9 million in
1998.

In fiscal 1999, Harris recorded a $5.1 million
charge ($3.3 million after income taxes) for severance costs
associated with the restructuring of its operations.
Restructuring actions included a work force reduction of
approximately 606 employees. At June 30, 2000, all of these
employees have been terminated.

The components and use of restructuring reserves
are summarized below:

Business Combinations

In January 2000, Harris purchased Louth
Automation, a leading supplier of advanced automation systems for
 radio and television broadcasters. Also, on June 30, 2000,
Harris purchased the assets of TRT Lucent Technologies’
point-to-point microwave radio business. These acquisitions have
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the results of operations of these acquired entities
 have been included in Harris’ consolidated income statement
 since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations
have not been presented because the effect of these acquisitions
was not material. Harris paid cash in the net amount of
approximately $87 million for Louth Automation and $30 million
for TRT Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point microwave radio
business. The final determination of these purchase prices is
subject to adjustment. The amount allocated to purchased
in-process research and development on the Louth Automation
acquisition was $10.7 million. The purchased in-process research
and development expenses were determined through established
valuation techniques in the technology communications industry
and were expensed upon acquisition because technological
feasibility had not been established and no future alternative
uses existed. Research and development costs to bring the
products from the acquired company to technological feasi-



Notes to Financial Statements

bility are not expected to have a material impact
on Harris’ future results of operations or cash flows.
Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets for
 Louth Automation are amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods not exceeding ten years. The amortization period for
purchased intangible assets in the TRT Lucent Technologies’
point-to-point microwave radio business has not been finalized.

Extraordinary Loss

In June 1999, Harris retired $150.0 million
of 10 3/8% debentures due in 2018 and $96.0 million of notes
 payable to insurance companies due from 1999 to 2001. Debt
retirement resulted in an extraordinary loss of $9.2 million
($.12 per share), net of related income taxes of $4.7 million.

Joint Ventures

Harris has investments in joint ventures (less
than 50% owned), which are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. Condensed balance sheets as of June 30, 2000
and July 2, 1999, and condensed statements of income for
fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998 for these joint ventures
follows. Harris has adjustments to income related to these
investments that are not pushed down to these condensed financial
 statements. The amount of income (loss) before taxes
included in “Other income” related to these joint
ventures is $(7.5) million in 2000, $7.5 million in 1999, and
$4.0 million in 1998.

Receivables

Receivables are summarized below:

Inventories and Unbilled Costs

Inventories are summarized below:

Unbilled costs and accrued earnings on fixed-price
 contracts are net of progress payments of $180.0 million at
June 30, 2000 and $171.1 million at July 2, 1999.

Plant and Equipment

Plant and equipment are summarized below:

Intangibles

Accumulated amortization of intangible assets was
$52.1 million at June 30, 2000 and $22.3 million at
July 2, 1999.

Credit Arrangements

Harris has available a syndicated credit facility
with various banks that provides for borrowings up to $500
million. This facility expires in November 2001. Interest rates
on borrowings under the $500 million facility are determined by a
 pricing matrix based upon Harris’ long-term debt ratings
assigned by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and
Moody’s Investors Service. A facility fee is payable on the
credit and determined in the same manner as the interest rates.
Harris is not required to maintain compensating balances in
connection with this agreement. Under the credit facility, none
was outstanding at June 30, 2000. This agreement contains
certain financial covenants including maintenance of at least
$900 million of tangible net worth and total debt not to exceed
50 percent of total capital.

Harris also has lines of credit for short-term
financing aggregating $98.8 million from various U.S. and foreign
 banks, of which $23.2 million was available on June 30,
2000. These arrangements provide for borrowing at various
interest rates, are reviewed annually for renewal, and may be
used on such terms as Harris and the banks mutually agree. These
lines do not require compensating balances. Approximately $149.8
million worth of debt was included in net assets of discontinued
operations on the July 2, 1999, consolidated balance sheet.

Short-Term Debt

Short-term debt of $75.6 million in 2000 and
$323.7 million in 1999 is entirely made up of notes payable to
banks in both years. As of June 30, 2000, $26.0 million of
these bank notes were with Brazilian banks at a weighted-average
interest rate of 18.1 percent. The weighted-average interest
 rate for bank notes other than those with Brazilian banks was



Notes to Financial Statements

6.4 percent as of June 30, 2000 and
6.3 percent as of July 2, 1999.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt includes the following:

The weighted-average interest rate for notes
payable to banks was 6.4 percent as of June 30, 2000
and 6.3 percent as of July 2, 1999. Maturities of
long-term debt for the five years following 2000 are: $32.8
million in 2001, $0.6 million in 2002, $31.0 million in 2003,
$0.5 million in 2004, and $0.3 million in 2005.

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

On December 6, 1996, Harris declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of Common Stock. These rights, which expire on
December 6, 2006, are evidenced by the Common Stock share
certificates and trade with the Common Stock until they become
exercisable, entitle the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of
a share of Participating Preferred Stock for $125, subject to
adjustment. The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of
10 business days (or such later date fixed by the Board) after a
party commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire a
beneficial interest of at least 15% of Harris’ outstanding
Common Stock, or the first date of public announcement by Harris
that a person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least 15%
of Harris’ outstanding Common Stock or such later date fixed
 by the Board of Directors of Harris.

Upon the first date of public announcement by
Harris that a person has acquired a beneficial interest of at
least 15% of Harris’ outstanding Common Stock, or such later
 date fixed by the Board of Directors of Harris, each right
(other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person or
any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the holder to
purchase shares of Common Stock of Harris having a market value
equal to twice the exercise price of the right. In addition, each
 right (other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring
person or any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the
rightholder to exercise the right and receive shares of common
stock of the acquiring company, upon a merger or other business
combination, having a market value of twice the exercise price of
 the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights
become exercisable, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange
all of the then outstanding rights for shares of Common Stock at
an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per right, subject
 to adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and may be
redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $.01 per right
at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial ownership of
 15% of the outstanding Common Stock.

Stock Options and Awards

The following information relates to stock option
and incentive stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent of
 market value on the date the options are granted. Option grants
are for a maximum of ten years after dates of grant and may be
exercised in installments. As a result of the spin-off of Lanier
Worldwide, Inc. on November 5, 1999 Harris adjusted the
option price and the number of shares on all of its outstanding
options so that the fair value of each option holders’
option would be the same before and after the distribution.



Notes to Financial Statements

Price ranges of outstanding and exercisable
options as of June 30, 2000 are summarized below:

Presented below is pro forma information regarding
 net income and net income per share. It has been determined as
if Harris had accounted for stock options using the fair value
method of accounting for stock options. The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions:

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the
estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense over
their three-year vesting period. Under the fair value method,
Harris’ net income and net income per share would have been
reduced as follows:

Because the fair value method of accounting for
options applies only to options granted subsequent to
June 30, 1995, the pro forma effect was not fully reflected
until 1999.

Harris has a stock incentive plan for directors
and key employees. Awards under this plan may include the grant
of performance shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock
appreciation rights, or other stock-based awards. The aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock which may be awarded under the
plan in each fiscal year is one percent of the total outstanding
shares of Common Stock plus shares available from prior years.
Performance shares outstanding were 209,716 at June 30,
2000, 429,869 at July 2, 1999, and 625,365 at July 3,
1998. Shares of Common Stock reserved for future awards under the
 plan were 3,242,441 at June 30, 2000, 2,296,417 at
July 2, 1999, and 2,509,002 at July 3, 1998.

Under Harris’ domestic retirement plan,
employees may purchase a limited amount of Harris’ Common
Stock at 70 percent of current market value. The discounts
from fair market value on Common Stock purchased by employees
under the domestic retirement plan are charged to compensation
expense in the period of the related purchase. Shares of Common
Stock reserved for future purchases by the retirement plan were
2,172,688 at June 30, 2000.

Net Income Per Share

Average outstanding shares used in the computation
 of net income per share are summarized below:

Retirement Plans

Retirement and defined benefit plans expense from
continuing operations amounted to $37.4 million in 2000, $43.0
million in 1999 and $55.0 million in 1998.

Research and Development

Company-sponsored research and product development
 costs from continuing operations are expensed as incurred. These
 costs were $99.9 million in 2000, $92.4 million in 1999, and
$94.0 million in 1998.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs
are incurred pursuant to long-term contractual arrangements and
are accounted for principally by the percentage-of-completion
method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
incurred under government-sponsored contracts require Harris to
provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance
or other specifications (such as designs).

Interest Expense

Total interest from continuing operations was
$25.2 million in 2000, $9.9 million in 1999, and $13.5
million in 1998. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
major long-term construction projects is capitalized as an
additional cost of the related asset. No interest was capitalized
 in fiscal 2000. Interest capitalized was $0.1 million in
1999 and $1.0 million in 1998. Interest paid was $25.5
million in 2000, $14.6 million in 1999, and $9.9 million in
1998.

Lease Commitments

Total rental expense from continuing operations
amounted to $21.7 million in 2000, $21.8 million in 1999, and
$19.3 million in 1998. Future minimum rental commitments under
leases,



Notes to Financial Statements

primarily for land and buildings, amounted to
approximately $60.9 million at June 30, 2000. These
commitments for the years following 2000 are: 2001 —
$16.3 million; 2002 — $12.4 million; 2003 —
$8.9 million; 2004 — $7.0 million; 2005 —
$6.4 million; and $9.9 million, thereafter.

Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes from continuing
operations are summarized as follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory United States
income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows:

The components of deferred income tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

United States income taxes have not been provided
on $346 million of undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries because of Harris’ intention to reinvest these
earnings. The determination of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax
liability for the undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries is not practicable.

Pretax income (loss) from continuing
operations of international subsidiaries was $1.0 million in
 2000, $2.7 million in 1999, and $(3.4) million in 1998.

Income taxes paid were $47.4 million in 2000,
$35.5 million in 1999, and $29.2 million in 1998.

Business Segments

Harris is structured primarily around the markets
it serves and operates in two business segments —
Government Communications and Commercial Communications. The
Government Communications segment engages in advanced research
and develops, designs, and produces advanced communication and
information processing systems. The Commercial Communications
segment produces broadcast, radio communications, and
telecommunications products and systems. Harris’ products
and systems are produced principally in the United States with
international revenues derived primarily from exports.

The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the Significant Accounting
Policies footnote. Harris evaluates performance based on profit
or loss from operations before income taxes excluding interest
income and expense, equity income, and gains or losses from
securities and other investments. Intersegment sales, which are
insignificant, are accounted for at prices comparable to
unaffiliated customers.

Sales made to the U.S. government by all segments
(primarily the Government Communications segment) were
40.6 percent of total revenues from continuing operations in
 2000, 42.3 percent of total revenues from continuing
operations in 1999, and 47.2 percent of revenues from
continuing operations in 1998.



Notes to Financial Statements

Selected information by business segment and
geographical area is summarized below:

Corporate assets consist primarily of cash,
marketable securities, plant and equipment, and net assets of
discontinued operations.

Export sales were $229.7 million in 2000, $242.2
million in 1999, and $320.6 million in 1998. Export sales and net
 sales of international operations were principally to Europe,
Asia, and Latin America.

Revenue and operating income by segment follows:

Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, notes receivable,
accounts payable, short-term debt, and long-term debt
approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term debt, as
determined by quotes from financial institutions, was
$351.3 million at June 30, 2000 and $493.5 million at
July 2, 1999.

Harris uses foreign exchange contracts and options
 to hedge intercompany accounts and off-balance sheet foreign
currency commitments. Specifically, these foreign exchange
contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and
purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable from and
 future committed sales to customers, and firm committed
operating expenses. Management believes the use of foreign
currency financial instruments should reduce the risks, which
arise from doing business in international markets. Contracts are
 for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying
transaction, generally one year or less. At June 30, 2000,
open foreign exchange contracts were $28.5 million, of which $4.0
 million were to hedge off-balance sheet commitments. The fair
market value of foreign exchange contracts and options as
determined by quoted market indices and quotes from financial
institutions was $28.5 million. Additionally, for the year ended
June 30, 2000, Harris purchased and sold $432.3 million of
foreign exchange forward and option contracts.

Deferred gains and losses are included on a net
basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as other assets and are
recorded in income as part of the underlying transaction when it
is recognized.

At June 30, 2000, Harris had no open option
contracts. Total open foreign exchange contracts at June 30,
 2000, are described in the table below:
