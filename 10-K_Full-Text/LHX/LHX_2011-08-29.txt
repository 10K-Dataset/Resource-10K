PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is an
    international communications and information technology company
    serving government and commercial markets in more than 150
    countries. We are dedicated to developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets, including RF
    communications, integrated network solutions and government
    communications systems.

Harris Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the
    successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard,
    Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is

(321) 727-9100.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “HRS.” On July 1, 2011, we employed
    approximately 16,900 people. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
    “us,” “Company” and “Harris” as
    used in this Report refer to Harris Corporation and its
    subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our operations in the following three
    reportable operating segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, comprised of
    (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International
    Tactical Communications and (ii) Public Safety and
    Professional Communications;

•

Our Integrated Network Solutions segment, comprised of
    (i) IT Services, (ii) Managed Satellite and
    Terrestrial Communications Solutions, (iii) Healthcare
    Solutions, (iv) Cyber Integrated Solutions and
    (v) Broadcast and New Media Solutions; and

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of
    (i) Civil Programs, (ii) Defense Programs and
    (iii) National Intelligence Programs.

As previously reported and as discussed further in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report (the
    “Notes”), our reportable operating segment structure
    reflects that, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned
    our operations to provide increased market focus and address the
    fast-growing global market for integrated communications and
    information technology and services. As a result of the
    realignment of our operations, effective for the third quarter
    of fiscal 2011, we formed our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment as a new segment. The new segment realigns IT Services,
    Managed Satellite and Terrestrial



Communications Solutions, Healthcare Solutions and Cyber
    Integrated Solutions (all of which were formerly under our
    Government Communications Systems segment) with Broadcast and
    New Media Solutions (formerly a separate reportable segment
    called Broadcast Communications). Our RF Communications segment
    did not change. The historical results, discussion and
    presentation of our operating segments as set forth in this
    Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes
    to our reportable operating segment structure for all periods
    presented in this Report.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 spin-off (the “Spin-off”) in the
    form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all
    the shares of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (now known as Aviat
    Networks, Inc.) (“HSTX”) common stock owned by us, we
    eliminated our former HSTX operating segment. Our historical
    financial results have been restated to account for HSTX as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in this
    Report, and unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this
    Report relate solely to our continuing operations. For
    additional information regarding discontinued operations, see

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

in the Notes.

Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or
    “Non-operating loss” line items in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.

Recent
    Acquisitions

Acquisition of CapRock.

On July 30, 2010,
    we acquired privately held CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc.
    (collectively, “CapRock”), a global provider of
    mission-critical, managed satellite communications services for
    the government, energy and maritime industries. CapRock’s
    solutions include broadband Internet access, voice over Internet
    Protocol (“VOIP”) telephony, wideband networking and
    real-time video, delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around
    the world. The acquisition of CapRock increased the breadth of
    our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The total net purchase
    price for CapRock was $517.5 million. We report CapRock as
    part of Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications
    Solutions under our Integrated Network Solutions segment.

Acquisition of Schlumberger GCS.

On
    April 4, 2011, we acquired from Schlumberger B.V. and its
    affiliates (“Schlumberger”) substantially all of the
    assets of the Schlumberger group’s Global Connectivity
    Services business (“Schlumberger GCS”), a provider of
    satellite and terrestrial communications services for the
    worldwide energy industry. The total net purchase price for
    Schlumberger GCS was $380.6 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. We report Schlumberger GCS as part of
    Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions under
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment.

Acquisition of Carefx.

Also on April 4,
    2011, we acquired privately held Carefx Corporation
    (“Carefx”), a provider of interoperability workflow
    solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers.
    Carefx’s solution suite is used by more than 800 hospitals,
    healthcare systems and health information exchanges across
    North America, Europe and Asia. This acquisition expanded
    our presence in government healthcare, provided entry into the
    commercial healthcare market, and is expected to leverage the
    healthcare interoperability workflow products offered by Carefx
    and the broader scale of enterprise intelligence solutions and
    services that we provide. The total net purchase price for
    Carefx was $152.6 million, subject to post-closing
    adjustments. We report Carefx as part of Healthcare Solutions
    under our Integrated Network Solutions segment.

Subsequent
    Event — Share Repurchase Program

On July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new
    $1 billion share repurchase program (the “New
    Repurchase Program”) and increased the quarterly cash
    dividend rate on our common stock from $0.25 per share to $0.28
    per share. The New Repurchase Program replaced our prior share
    repurchase program (the “2009 Repurchase Program”),
    which had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately
    $200 million. The New Repurchase Program does not have a
    stated expiration date. We currently expect to repurchase up to
    $500 million in shares under the New Repurchase Program by
    the end of calendar year 2011. The New Repurchase Program is
    expected to result in repurchases well in excess of the dilutive
    effect of shares issued under our share-based incentive plans.
    However, the level of our repurchases depends on a number of
    factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    Share repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash
    and commercial paper. Repurchases under the New Repurchase
    Program may be made through open market purchases, private
    transactions, transactions structured through investment banking
    institutions, or any combination thereof. The timing, volume and
    nature of



share repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable
    securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and
    may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Financial
    Information About Our Business Segments

Financial information with respect to our business segments,
    including revenue, operating income or loss and total assets,
    and with respect to our operations outside the United States, is
    contained in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes
    and is incorporated herein by reference.

Description
    of Business by Segment

RF
    Communications

RF Communications is a global supplier of secure tactical radio
    communications and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for
    military, government and commercial organizations and also of
    secure communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. RF Communications is
    comprised of (i) U.S. Department of Defense and
    International Tactical Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications.

U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical
    Communications:

We design, develop and
    manufacture a comprehensive line of secure radio communications
    products and systems for manpack, handheld, soldier-worn,
    vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard applications that
    operate in various radio frequency bands —
    high-frequency (“HF”), very high-frequency
    (“VHF”) and ultra high-frequency
    (“UHF”) — as well as in multiband mode and
    over satellite communications (“SATCOM”). These radio
    systems are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of
    supporting diverse mission requirements. Our
    Falcon

®

family of tactical radios is built on a software-defined radio
    platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software
    upgrades. Our Falcon radios also have the highest grade embedded
    encryption and provide highly mobile, secure and reliable
    network communications capability without relying on a fixed
    infrastructure. This capability allows warfighters, for example,
    to remain connected with each other, their command structures
    and support organizations, and provides them the ability to
    communicate information and maintain situational awareness of
    both friendly and opposing forces, which are critical to both
    the safety and success of their missions. Our Falcon radio
    systems have been widely deployed in multiple variants of Mine
    Resistant Ambush-Protect (“MRAP”) vehicles for the
    U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”).

Unlike many of our competitors in the U.S. Government
    market, we operate this business on a “commercial”
    customer-driven business model, as opposed to a government
    programs-driven business model. This means that we anticipate
    market needs, invest our internal research and development
    resources, build to our internal forecast, and provide

ready-to-ship,

commercial,

off-the-shelf

(“COTS”) products to customers more quickly than
    customers can typically obtain similar products under
    government-funded programs.

Our Falcon
    III

®

family of radios is the next generation of multiband,
    multi-mission tactical radios supporting the
    U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System
    (“JTRS”) requirements as well as network-centric
    operations worldwide. Our Falcon III radios address the
    full range of current mission and interoperability requirements
    and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical
    standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in
    our Falcon III radios include extended frequency range,
    significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous
    generations and programmable encryption.

Our Falcon III multiband handheld radio, the AN/PRC-152(C)
    (“152C”), is the world’s most widely deployed
    JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio and was our first
    Falcon III radio to be fielded. We have successfully
    fielded more than 100,000 152Cs, which are widely fielded by all
    branches of the DoD, many allies worldwide and U.S. Federal
    agencies. The 152C offers users a wide range of capabilities,
    such as legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne System
    (“SINCGARS”) interoperability; UHF

ground-to-ground

line-of-sight

communications; close-air support; tactical SATCOM; and the
    Association of Public Safety Communications
    Officials — International (“APCO”) P25
    waveform to provide direct communications with first responders.
    The 152C also serves as the handheld-based transceiver of our
    Falcon III AN/VRC-110, a high-performance, multiband
    vehicular system that offers the added feature of easy vehicle
    dismount — a

“grab-and-go”

feature that delivers continuous communications when removed
    from the vehicle, an important capability in urban environments.

Our Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G
    (“117G”), is the first JTRS Software Communications
    Architecture (“SCA”)-certified and National Security
    Agency (“NSA”) Type-1 certified manpack radio system
    providing wideband networking capability, enabling the
    transition to a networked battlefield communications environment
    and high-bandwidth applications, including streaming video,
    simultaneous voice and data feeds, intelligence reporting and
    analysis, collaborative chat, route planning, convoy tracking,
    checkpoint biometrics and connectivity to secure networks
    (“SIPRNet”). The 117G uses the Harris-developed
    Adaptive



Networking Wideband Waveform (“ANW2”) for high
    bandwidth data operation and is designed for future upgrade to
    the JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (“SRW”). The
    117G’s wideband network access capabilities give
    warfighters and field commanders critical real-time information.
    The 117G has been deployed to all branches of the DoD and is
    being used in a wide variety of ground, vehicular and airborne
    applications, including intelligence, surveillance and
    reconnaissance (“ISR”). The 117G includes a Remote
    Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (“ROVER”)
    interoperable mode that provides warfighters on the battlefield
    with the ability to receive live video directly from unmanned
    aerial vehicles (“UAVs”). This capability allows users
    to receive video feeds directly from UAVs without an
    intermediary or having to pass that information from a base
    station.

Our cryptographic solutions encompass NSA-certified products and
    systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems, including our
    Sierra

®

and
    Citadel

®

embedded encryption solutions and KGV-72 blue force tracking
    programmable encryption devices and our SecNet

®

and SecNet

tm

Internet Protocol (“IP”) communications families of
    communications security (“COMSEC”) terminals.

In the international market, our tactical radios are the
    standard of NATO and Partnership for Peace countries and have
    been sold to more than 100 countries through our strong,
    longstanding international distribution channels consisting of
    regional sales offices and a broad dealer network. International
    tactical radio demand is being driven by continuing tactical
    communications modernization and standardization programs to
    provide more sophisticated communications capabilities to
    address traditional and emerging threats and to provide
    interoperability. In fiscal 2011, we received tactical radio
    orders from,

and/or

made
    deliveries to, a wide range of international customers,
    including Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and
    various countries in Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia that we are
    not permitted to name. Additionally, we are providing integrated
    communications systems for the international market. Our
    integrated systems offerings are largely based on our products,
    but include other companies’ products, as well as a wide
    variety of applications, in order to implement integrated
    command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
    surveillance and reconnaissance (“C4ISR”) systems for
    many different types of platforms, including command post and
    transit case systems, vehicular and shelter communications
    systems and specialized airborne applications, which are
    frequently used in border security and surveillance systems.

Public Safety and Professional
    Communications:

We supply

assured
    communications

®

systems and equipment for public safety, federal, utility,
    commercial and transportation markets, with products ranging
    from complete

end-to-end

wireless network infrastructure solutions, including advanced IP
    voice and data networks, that support multiple platforms and
    provide interoperability among disparate systems, to portable
    and mobile single-band and multiband, multimode radios, to
    public safety-grade broadband voice, video and data solutions.
    On May 29, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the
    assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems business
    (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known as M/A-COM). Our
    acquisition of Wireless Systems served to form our Public Safety
    and Professional Communications business. This business has more
    than 80 years of experience and supports over
    500 systems around the world.

As part of our business of designing, building, distributing,
    maintaining and supplying wireless communications systems, we
    offer our Voice, Interoperability, Data and Access
    (“VIDA”) network platform — a unified

IP-based

voice and data communication system based on APCO P25 industry
    standards that provides network-level interoperable
    communications among public safety agencies and that supports a
    full line of communications systems, including
    OpenSky

®

,

    NetworkFirst,
    P25

IP

and

    Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
    (“EDACS”), allowing seamless interconnection of
    diverse systems. Our VIDA network solutions currently serve as
    the backbone in some of the largest and most advanced statewide
    and regional communications networks in North America, including
    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and State of Florida.

In addition to a full range of single-band land mobile radio
    terminals, we offer our
    Unity

tm

family of multiband radios, including the Unity XG-100P handheld
    radio and the new Unity XG-100M full-spectrum mobile radio for
    vehicles. Our Unity multiband radios cover all public safety
    frequency bands in a single radio; operate on APCO P25
    conventional and trunked systems; are backwards compatible with
    analog FM systems; and include advanced capabilities, such as an
    internal Global Positioning System (“GPS”) receiver
    for situational awareness, internal secure
    Bluetooth

®

wireless technology, and background noise suppression features.
    They also include true software-defined radio architecture that
    allows flexibility for future growth, including a software-only
    upgrade to APCO P25 Phase 2, the next-generation emerging
    standard for mission-critical communications. Our Unity
    radios’ multiband, multi-mode capabilities enable a single
    radio to communicate with multiple organizations, jurisdictions
    and agencies operating on different frequencies and systems,
    thus providing a significant improvement over most current radio
    systems for U.S. public safety, which are not interoperable
    and thus require users to carry multiple radios or route
    transmissions through ad-hoc network bridges, often configured
    at the time of an emergency, and resulting in instances where
    agencies responding to a common incident cannot talk to each
    other.



We received two large, multi-year program awards in fiscal 2011,
    both in the third quarter:

•

A contract by the Government of Alberta, Canada to design and
    build the Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System
    that will provide public safety communications within the
    Province’s

256,000 square-mile

area, including an initial order of CAD289 million; and

•

A

10-year

price agreement requirements contract by the State of Oregon for
    the Oregon State Radio Project (“OSRP”) program
    designed to improve voice and data interoperability among state,
    local, county, tribal and federal agencies, under which Oregon
    state and local agencies may purchase public safety
    communication systems, radios and other equipment. We received
    an initial order of $50 million under the OSRP contract
    vehicle in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 that includes 4,200
    of our new Unity XG-100M multiband mobile radios.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the RF Communications segment increased 10.7 percent to
    $2,289 million in fiscal 2011 compared with
    $2,067 million in fiscal 2010, and was $1,761 million
    in fiscal 2009. Segment operating income increased
    11.3 percent to $787.0 million in fiscal 2011 compared
    with $707.4 million in fiscal 2010, and was
    $571.5 million in fiscal 2009. The RF Communications
    segment contributed 39 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2011 compared with 40 percent in fiscal 2010 and
    35 percent in fiscal 2009. The percentage of this
    segment’s revenue that was derived outside of the United

    improve healthcare quality, safety, efficiency, cost and
    outcomes by ensuring that the right information travels, with
    security and privacy, to the right person, at the right time, on
    the right device, at the point of care.

For example, we developed under a contract from the Department
    of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) an open-source
    National Health Information Network (“NHIN”) CONNECT
    Gateway solution designed to enable seamless health information
    sharing among multiple Federal agencies and regional healthcare
    providers. We developed a multi-hospital military health network
    with image-sharing capabilities under the DoD Military Health
    System global Healthcare Artifact and Image Management Solution
    (“HAIMS”) program.

In fiscal 2011, we were one of eight companies in the large
    business category awarded the five-year Transformation
    Twenty-One Total Technology (“T4”) IDIQ contracting
    vehicle from the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”)
    designed to upgrade the VA’s IT system and covering
    services that will streamline and modernize VA operations,
    including patient care delivery at more than 150 VA hospitals.
    We also were awarded a second VA contract vehicle, the Enhance
    the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare
    (“EVEAH”) blanket purchase agreement with a ceiling
    value of $199 million, and received initial task orders.
    After the close of fiscal 2011, we were awarded a contract from
    the VA for the Enterprise Management Foundation Federated Data

    network monitoring system that will provide the VA with a
    unified view of its critical infrastructure.

In addition, we have provided interoperability solutions for
    large-scale health information exchange enterprises such as the
    VA, the DoD and the Social Security Administration. We also have
    extended Federal interoperability solutions to the private
    sector where over half of all care is provided for active duty
    and retired service members. In



fiscal 2011, we were awarded a four-year contract by the State
    of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration
    (“AHCA”) to implement a statewide health information
    exchange (“HIE”) that will improve the delivery and
    coordination of healthcare. As described under
    “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report, we acquired Carefx during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Carefx is a provider of
    interoperability workflow solutions for government and
    commercial healthcare providers, and its solution suite,
    Fusionfx, gives care providers a unified look at patient data
    and closes data gaps to ensure a more consistent, higher quality
    experience for the patient, reducing clinical errors and
    increasing individual productivity.

Also in fiscal 2011, we received an option year extension from
    the VA for healthcare imaging software and systems engineering
    services for the VistA imaging application, and we announced a
    joint venture with Johns Hopkins Medicine to focus on developing
    next-generation medical image management solutions to be
    deployed by the Johns Hopkins Health System and later, to
    hospitals and healthcare providers around the United States.

Cyber Integrated Solutions:

We are working
    closely with government and commercial organizations in
    introducing a new offering to help them move part or all of
    their operations to a trusted cloud computing environment in an
    effective and efficient manner by using our cyber integration
    capabilities to bring together an innovative combination of
    patented trust methodologies, industry-leading technologies,
    partnerships with market leaders and world-class infrastructure.

For example, the Harris Trusted Enterprise
    Cloud

tm

is a newly launched cloud application hosting system that we
    offer as a unique Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”)
    designed to enable clients to extend and enhance their IT
    operations in order to improve operational agility and reduce
    costs. Our Trusted Enterprise Cloud solution is delivered via
    The Harris Cyber Integration
    Center

tm

,

    located in our over 100,000-square-foot advanced data center
    facility in the Mid-Atlantic region. The center is an innovative
    cloud node that was designed from the ground up to offer
    technology and services that meet the highest industry and
    government standards for reliability and security.

Key differentiators in these offerings are our proprietary trust
    enablement technologies, including the Global
    Trust Repository and the Enterprise Trust Server,
    which provide continuous monitoring, assurance, and attestation
    that the software and configurations in the cloud computing
    environment are deployed and operating according to
    specification and have not been compromised, and which we also
    may license to partners and customers. In fiscal 2011, we
    announced a strategic alliance with EMC Corporation and the
    Virtual Computing Environment Company (“VCE”) to
    jointly develop and market new trusted multi-tenant cloud
    solutions to further accelerate the adoption of cloud computing
    IaaS by government and commercial enterprises.

In pursuing these new, high-value applications for our
    capabilities and technologies, we are seeking to leverage our
    experience as an industry leader in cyber security. For example,
    we have been using

state-of-the-art

technology assessment techniques and architecture engineering
    for decades to define and operate secure networks supporting
    nationally critical programs, including three of the U.S.’s
    largest, secure mission-critical networks — the
    Federal Aviation Administration Telecommunications
    Infrastructure (“FTI”) program network, the Patriot
    program network and the NMCI program network. Our technology,
    countermeasures and monitoring capabilities safeguard vital
    information systems that support the critical missions of
    U.S. military, intelligence and Federal law enforcement
    customers.

Broadcast and New Media Solutions:

We offer
    hardware and software products, systems and services that
    provide interoperable workflow solutions for broadcast, cable,
    satellite and

out-of-home

networks worldwide. The Harris
    ONE

tm

solution brings together highly integrated and cost-effective
    products that enable advanced media workflows for emerging
    content delivery business models. We are supporting customers as
    they upgrade media operations to digital and high definition
    (“HD”) services from analog and standard definition
    (“SD”) services and as they expand services for HD
    television (“HDTV”), IPTV,

video-on-demand

and interactive TV. We serve the global digital and analog media
    markets, providing infrastructure and networking products and
    solutions; media and server systems; and television and radio
    transmission equipment and systems.

Our infrastructure and networking solutions offerings enable
    media companies to streamline workflow from production through
    transmission. We offer a portfolio of advanced products,
    including signal processors, routers, master control and
    branding systems, network monitoring and control software, test
    and measurement instruments, multi-image display processors,
    broadcast graphics, and highly differentiated network access and
    multiplex platforms.

Our media and server systems offerings enable customers to
    manage their digital media workflow and storage, as well as
    other key facets of an increasingly file-based broadcast
    environment, through our portfolio of software solutions for
    advertising, media management (traffic, billing and program
    scheduling), digital signage, broadband, digital asset
    management and play-out automation, and our family of scalable,
    interoperable video servers.



We develop, manufacture and supply television and radio
    transmission systems for delivery of rich media over wireless
    broadcast terrestrial networks on a worldwide basis, including
    mobile TV applications. We can provide single products or

end-to-end

systems, including nationwide networks with hundreds of
    transmitters.

In addition, supporting digital

out-of-home

advertising is an emerging growth area, and our solutions enable
    advertisers to reach consumers on the move. We believe new
    systems will be increasingly deployed to deliver rich media
    content in live sports and entertainment venues and in retail
    establishments. For example, we helped design the system of
    IPTV, digital signage and IT infrastructure to create an
    in-arena network for the Orlando Magic’s new basketball
    arena, and we are providing hardware and software supporting
    content delivery for a project in collaboration with Digital
    Display Networks, Inc. and ABC to create one of the largest
    digital

out-of-home

advertising networks in the world, 7-Eleven TV, which has been
    installed in over 3,000 7-Eleven stores. In fiscal 2011, we
    installed our first digital signage system in the United Kingdom
    at Harrods, a luxury department store, and began designing an
    advanced, digital,

out-of-home

and IPTV network for the new Madison Square Garden
    Transformation project that will include 1,100 arena displays to
    deliver a dynamic viewing experience to fans.

    Programs, (ii) Defense Programs and (iii) National
    Intelligence Programs.

Civil Programs:

We provide highly reliable,
    mission-critical communications and information processing
    systems that meet the most demanding needs of customers in the
    U.S. civilian Federal market, including the Federal
    Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). We
    use our ability to implement and manage large, complex programs
    that integrate secure, advanced communications and information
    processing technologies in order to improve productivity and
    information processing and to achieve cost savings for our
    customers. Our networks and information systems for large-scale,
    geographically dispersed enterprises offer advanced capabilities
    for collecting, processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying,
    distributing, storing and retrieving data. We are a leader in
    satellite ground data processing and mission

command-and-control

(“C2”) systems. Our ground data processing systems
    consist of complex suites of hardware and software that receive
    sensor data from satellites, turning it into useable
    information. Our C2 systems feature COTS design and high levels
    of flexibility, are designed for government and commercial
    applications, and support single-satellite missions as well as
    some of the largest and most complex satellite fleets deployed.

For example, we are the prime contractor and system architect
    under a

15-year

contract awarded in July 2002, with a potential value of
    $3.5 billion, for the FTI program to integrate, modernize,
    operate and maintain the communications infrastructure for the
    U.S. air traffic control system. FTI is a modern, secure
    and efficient network providing voice, data and video
    communications deployed at more than 4,500 FAA sites across the
    United States to enhance network efficiency, reliability and
    security and to improve service while reducing operating costs.
    We designed and deployed the FTI network and it is fully
    operational. The FTI network consists of the Operations Network,
    the Mission Support Network, the Satellite Network and the
    Microwave Network. The supporting infrastructure includes the
    Network Operations Control Centers (“NOCCs”) and
    Security Operations Control Centers (“SOCCs”). The FTI
    program has completed its equipment build-out phase and is
    transitioning to its telecommunication services and maintenance
    phase.

Other FAA programs under which we have developed solutions
    include the following:

•

The Operational and Supportability Implementation System
    (“OASIS”), for which we are the prime contractor and
    which provides integrated weather briefing and flight planning
    capabilities for preflight weather briefings and in-flight
    updates for Alaska’s general aviation community. In fiscal
    2011, we were awarded a follow-on contract by the FAA to upgrade
    and manage the OASIS system;

•

The Weather and Radar Processor (“WARP”) system, a
    meteorological data processing system serving the en-route air
    traffic control environment that generates radar mosaic data for
    air traffic controller displays and delivers weather data to
    critical subsystems within the National Airspace System
    (“NAS”). In fiscal 2010, we were awarded a six-year
    contract, with a potential value of $97 million, by the FAA
    under the WARP Maintenance and Sustainment Services II
    program to continue to maintain the WARP system by providing
    hardware and software maintenance, depot support,

on-site

field support and engineering services at 22 operational
    FAA facilities in the United States;

•

The Voice Switching and Control System (“VSCS”), which
    provides the critical

air-to-ground

communications links between en-route aircraft and air traffic
    controllers throughout the continental
    United States.; and

•

The satellite-based Alaskan NAS Interfacility Communications
    System (“ANICS”), which links the Alaskan Air Route
    Traffic Control Center in Anchorage with 64 FAA facilities
    throughout the region. After the close of fiscal 2011, we were
    selected as the prime contractor under the Alaska Satellite
    Telecommunications Infrastructure (“ASTI”) program for
    a

10-year

contract, with a potential value of $85 million, from the
    FAA to upgrade the ANICS network by replacing and upgrading
    components and providing a new network management system, system
    security enhancements, logistics support and training in order
    to increase network performance and availability while reducing
    the FAA’s operating and maintenance costs.

Another example of our capabilities relates to NOAA’s
    Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite —
    Series R (“GOES-R”) Ground and Antenna Segment
    weather programs. Under two ten-year contracts, with an
    aggregate potential value of approximately $1 billion
    (including change orders), we are providing a complete,



end-to-end

solution in which we will design, develop, deploy and operate
    the ground segment system that will receive and process
    satellite data and generate and distribute weather data to more
    than 10,000 direct users, as well as providing the command and
    control of operational satellites. We also are supplying
    antennas and control systems that will provide communications
    links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as the
    communications link to direct data users. The new antennas will
    operate with next-generation GOES-R satellites and will be
    compatible with existing GOES-N through GOES-P satellites.

Defense Programs:

We develop, supply and
    integrate communications and information processing products,
    systems and networks for a diverse base of aerospace,
    terrestrial and maritime applications supporting DoD missions,
    and we are committed to delivering leading-edge technologies
    that support the ongoing transformations of military
    communications for U.S. and international customers. Our
    technologies are providing advanced mobile wideband networking
    capabilities to assure timely and secure network-centric
    capabilities across strategic, operational and tactical
    boundaries in support of the DoD’s full spectrum of
    warfighting, intelligence and logistics missions. Our major
    technology capabilities include advanced ground control systems
    and SATCOM terminals for transportable ground, fixed-site and
    shipboard applications; flat-panel, phased-array and
    single-mission antennas; advanced aviation electronics for
    military jets, including digital maps, modems, sensors, data
    buses, fiber optics and microelectronics; and high-speed data
    links and data networks for wireless communications.

For example, our mobile ad hoc networking capability allows the
    military to take its communications infrastructure with it,
    creating mobile, robust, self-forming and self-healing networks
    across the battlefield. Our Highband Networking
    Radio

tm

(“HNR”) provides secure, wireless, high-bandwidth,

on-the-move

communications among users of widely dispersed local area
    networks (“LANs”) by establishing

line-of-sight

connectivity using directive beam antenna technology and a
    Harris-developed waveform that automatically selects the best
    communications path available, allowing seamless communication
    of voice, video and data to all levels of command. We announced
    in fiscal 2009 that our HNR system was deployed to the
    U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)
    2nd Brigade Combat Team in Iraq, which was the first combat
    deployment of the HNR system. In fiscal 2010, we were awarded a
    contract to provide HNRs to form the communications backbone of
    the U.S. Army’s new Integrated Air and Missile Defense
    Battle Command System (“IBCS”). We are currently
    producing and delivering HNRs under the U.S. Army’s
    Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (“WIN-T”)
    program, and also we were awarded a contract in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2011 from the U.S. Army for rapid
    deployment of HNRs into Afghanistan.

In fiscal 2011, we also introduced
    Knighthawk

tm

3G, a ruggedized, highly mobile tactical base station that
    enables warfighters on the move to maintain third generation
    (“3G”) cellular services in locations with limited or
    no cellular connectivity. Knighthawk 3G is a customizable
    cellular network in a box compatible with COTS equipment,
    including smartphones and tablets.

Examples of ongoing programs for us include the following:

•

The U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals
    (“MET”) program, for which we are developing, under a
    ten-year contract, with a potential value of $600 million,
    awarded to us in fiscal 2009, next-generation large satellite
    earth stations to provide the worldwide backbone for
    high-priority military communications and missile defense
    systems and to support IP and Dedicated Circuit Connectivity
    within the Global Information Grid (“GIG”), providing
    critical reach-back capability for the warfighter;

•

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“F-35”), F-22 Raptor
    and

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet aircraft platform programs, for which we provide
    high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber
    optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image
    processing, digital map software and other electronic
    components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link
    (“MADL”) communications subsystems primarily intended
    for stealth platform

air-to-air

communications and which allow F-35s to communicate in a stealth
    fashion with other network nodes without revealing their
    positions;

•

The WIN-T program for the U.S. Army, for which we are
    designing and testing the wireless transmission system
    architecture, applying our proven enabling technologies for
    wireless

on-the-move

communications, including phased arrays and high-speed secure
    wireless network solutions such as our HNR system; and

•

The Commercial Broadband Satellite Program (“CBSP”)
    for the U.S. Navy, for which we supply broadband multiband
    SATCOM terminals that support essential mission requirements and
    provide enhanced morale-related communications services such as
    high-speed Internet access and video communications.

National Intelligence Programs:

A significant
    portion of this business involves classified programs. While
    classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report,
    the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe
    that the business risks associated with those programs do not
    differ materially from the business risks of other
    U.S. Government programs.



We are a major developer, supplier and integrator of
    communications and information processing products, systems and
    networks for a diverse base of U.S. Intelligence Community
    programs, and we support the ongoing transformation of the
    Intelligence Community into a more collaborative enterprise.
    Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency
    customers, including NSA, NRO and the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (“NGA”), we provide
    integrated ISR solutions that improve situational awareness,
    data collection accuracy and product analysis by correlating
    near real-time mission data and intelligence reference data for
    display and analysis by strategic and tactical planners and
    decision makers. Our ISR systems help to integrate information
    across the analyst workflow, accelerating the movement of
    information that has been collected and processed. We strive to
    produce innovative ISR solutions that provide our customers with
    information dominance for battle-space superiority.

For example, our image processing capabilities extend from
    algorithm development through delivery of operations systems,
    and we are providing advanced image exploitation and
    dissemination solutions for ISR applications by advancing image
    processing, image data fusion, display technologies and digital
    product generation techniques. Those technologies range from new
    techniques for merging and displaying imagery to automated
    techniques for image screening, cueing and remote visualization.
    Also, our mapping and visualization capabilities provide
    complete, accurate and timely knowledge about the threat, the
    terrain, the status and the location of single or multiple
    opposing and friendly forces and their support by utilizing
    data, pictures, voice and video drawn from vast storage banks or
    from real-time input which can be transmitted around the world
    in fractions of a second. In addition, we have industry-leading
    capabilities in the architecture, design and development of
    highly specialized satellite antennas, structures, phased arrays
    and on-board processors, which are used to enable
    next-generation satellite systems to provide the
    U.S. military and intelligence communities with strategic
    and tactical advantages. We are also a leader in the design and
    development of antenna and reflector technologies for commercial
    space telecommunications applications. Further, our capabilities
    include developing and supplying

state-of-the-art

wireless voice and data products and solutions, including
    surveillance and tracking equipment, spanning vehicular,
    man-portable, airborne and system-level applications for the
    U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement community.
    We also offer cyber security solutions and enterprise analytics,
    including an array of mission-enabling engineering solutions
    that address both offensive and defensive IT security
    challenges, providing critical support to Federal law
    enforcement and other U.S. Government agencies.

During fiscal 2011, we were awarded a number of new contracts
    and follow-on contracts under classified programs. We also were
    awarded a

30-month

contract by Sierra Nevada Corporation to design, build and
    integrate the synthetic aperture radar (“SAR”)
    satellite payload as part of NASA’s Rapid Response Space
    Works and Modular Space Vehicles program; a three-year contract
    from Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems to build

Ka-band

antennas for three Inmarsat-5 satellites; and a three-year
    contract from Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems for a
    22-meter deployable L-band reflector to support military and
    civil communications in Mexico.

In addition, our full motion video (“FMV”) initiatives
    support the ISR market for FMV products and systems, including
    all U.S. Government, international military and Federal law
    enforcement activities for the Harris Full Motion Video Asset
    Management Engine
    (“FAME

tm

”)

    architecture and related technologies. FAME is a COTS-based
    collaborative platform that provides video, audio and metadata
    coding, video analytics, and archive capabilities —
    all within a unified digital asset management
    solution — giving our customers greater visibility and
    better access to increasing amounts of digital ISR information,
    including higher-resolution FMV, motion imagery and visual
    imagery, such as that collected from manned and unmanned
    aircraft and ground-based sensors.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the Government Communications Systems segment increased
    1.7 percent to $1,777 million in fiscal 2011 compared
    with $1,747 million in fiscal 2010, and was
    $1,864 million in fiscal 2009. Segment operating income was
    $227.0 million in fiscal 2011 compared with
    $227.4 million in fiscal 2010 and $199.2 million in
    fiscal 2009. This segment contributed 30 percent of our
    total revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with 34 percent in
    fiscal 2010 and 37 percent in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011,
    approximately 70 percent of revenue for this segment was
    under direct contracts with customers and approximately
    30 percent of revenue was under contracts with prime
    contractors, compared with approximately 73 percent of
    revenue under direct contracts with customers and approximately
    27 percent of revenue under contracts with prime
    contractors in fiscal 2010 and approximately 72 percent of
    revenue under direct contracts with customers and approximately
    28 percent of revenue under contracts with prime
    contractors in fiscal 2009. Some of this segment’s more
    significant programs in fiscal 2011 included FTI, GOES-R, F-35,
    MET, WIN-T and various classified and space communications
    systems programs. This segment’s largest program by revenue
    in a particular fiscal year represented approximately
    14 percent of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2011
    compared with approximately 14 percent in fiscal 2010 and
    approximately 19 percent in fiscal 2009. This
    segment’s ten largest programs by revenue in a particular
    fiscal year represented approximately 46 percent of this
    segment’s revenue in fiscal 2011,



compared with approximately 46 percent in fiscal 2010 and
    approximately 50 percent in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011,
    this segment had a diverse portfolio of approximately 200
    programs. U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, accounted for approximately
    97 percent of this segment’s total revenue in fiscal
    2011 compared with approximately 94 percent in both fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009. For a general description of our
    U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a
    discussion of revenue generated from cost-reimbursable versus
    fixed-price contracts, see “Item 1.
    Business — Principal Customers; Government
    Contracts” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $800 million at July 1, 2011 compared with
    $848 million at July 2, 2010 and $762 million at
    July 3, 2009. Unfunded backlog for this segment was
    $3,193 million at July 1, 2011 compared with
    $2,504 million at July 2, 2010 and $3,223 million
    at July 3, 2009. We expect to fill approximately
    81 percent of this funded backlog during fiscal 2012, but
    we can give no assurance of such fulfillment. Additional
    information regarding funded and unfunded backlog is provided
    under “Item 1. Business — Funded and
    Unfunded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating
    to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see
    “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
    Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of
    this Report.

International
    Business

Revenue from products and services exported from the United
    States (including foreign military sales) or manufactured or
    rendered abroad was $1,307.1 million (22 percent of
    our total revenue) in fiscal 2011 compared with
    $724.6 million (14 percent of our total revenue) in
    fiscal 2010 and $1,016.6 million (20 percent of our
    total revenue) in fiscal 2009. Essentially all of the
    international sales are derived from our RF Communications and
    Integrated Network Solutions segments. Direct export sales are
    primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas sales from
    foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local
    currency of the subsidiary. Financial information regarding our
    domestic and international operations is contained in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes and is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Our principal international manufacturing facilities are located
    in Canada and the United Kingdom. The majority of our
    international marketing activities are conducted through
    subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
    America, and Asia. We have also established international
    marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
    Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
    Registrant” of this Report for further information
    regarding our international subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
    distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
    sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
    and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
    for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the independent representative and may be above
    or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally
    receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those
    prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.
    Revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2011 represented
    10 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    40 percent of our international revenue, compared with
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2010 representing
    6 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    35 percent of our international revenue, and revenue from
    indirect sales channels in fiscal 2009 representing
    11 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    55 percent of our international revenue.

Fiscal 2011 international revenue came from a large number of
    countries, and no such single country accounted for more than
    4 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are
    paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either
    on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments,
    progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or
    upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
    Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to
    provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in
    international markets, we also sometimes enter into recourse and
    vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain
    customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the United States differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
    Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
    partially mitigated by the diversification of the international
    business and the protection provided by letters of credit and
    advance payments.



Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
    management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are product quality and reliability;
    technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability
    to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability
    to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party
    sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.
    Within the IT services market, there is intense competition
    among many companies. The ability to compete in the IT services
    market depends on a number of factors, including the capability
    to deploy skilled professionals at competitive prices across the
    diverse spectrum of the IT services market.

In the RF Communications segment, principal competitors include
    European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company N.V.
    (“EADS”), General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Motorola
    Solutions, Raytheon, Rohde & Schwarz, Tadiran and
    Thales.

In the Integrated Network Solutions segment, principal
    competitors include Avid, Computer Sciences Corporation, Evertz,
    EVS Corporation, General Dynamics, Globecomm, Harmonic,
    Hewlett Packard, Lockheed Martin, ManTech, Miranda, MTN, NCI
    Information Systems, NEC, Northrop Grumman, Omnibus, Raytheon,
    RigNet, Rohde & Schwarz, Sony Broadcast, Stratos, TCS,
    Technicolor, Tektronix/Danaher, Telos Corporation, Thomson, and
    Vizada, as well as other smaller companies and divisions of
    large companies.

In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal
    competitors include BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, L-3
    Communications, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and
    Rockwell Collins. We frequently “partner” or are
    involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
    companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
    programs.

Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, were 72 percent of our total
    revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with 75 percent in fiscal
    2010 and 74 percent in fiscal 2009. No other customer
    accounted for more than 1 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2011. Additional information regarding customers for each
    of our segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment” of
    this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
    derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
    to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales of our
    Government Communications Systems segment and of the portions of
    our Integrated Networks Solutions segment’s IT services,
    managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions and
    healthcare solutions operations in connection with
    U.S. Government programs are made directly or indirectly to
    the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
    containing standard government contract clauses providing for
    redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
    based upon performance.

Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both
    cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Governmentwide
    Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”) and IDIQ contracts,
    which can include task orders for each contract type, require us
    to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual
    task or delivery orders under such contracts.

Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for
    the reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee.
    Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts fall into
    three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which
    provide for the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final
    cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee
    contracts, which provide for increases or decreases in the fee,
    within specified limits, based upon actual results compared with
    contractual targets relating to factors such as cost,
    performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus
    award-fee contracts, which provide for the payment of an award
    fee determined at the discretion of the customer based upon the
    performance of the contractor against pre-established
    performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government
    cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for
    allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on
    contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially
    or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or
    regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs,
    lobbying costs, charitable contributions and certain litigation
    defense costs.

Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm
    fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
    our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to
    perform a specific scope of work for a



fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and
    carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our
    U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share
    with the U.S. Government both savings accrued from
    contracts performed for less than target costs as well as costs
    incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price
    (which is higher than the target cost), but carry the entire
    burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
    Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be
    adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified performance
    objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm
    fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually
    receive either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of
    the contract price or monthly progress payments from the
    U.S. Government in amounts equaling 80 percent of
    costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts,
    including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery
    and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the
    contract. Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts
    generally have higher profit margins than our
    U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts. Our production
    contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and development
    contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for
    default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
    Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
    funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
    policies resulting from various military, political, economic
    and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government
    contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if
    appropriations for subsequent performance periods become
    unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of
    the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
    payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
    proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
    Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
    the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
    and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
    of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
    In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
    complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
    difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
    developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
    many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
    facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD
    and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of
    risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $7,786 million at July 1, 2011 compared
    with approximately $6,526 million at July 2, 2010 and
    $6,317 million at July 3, 2009. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $3,358 million at
    July 1, 2011 compared with approximately
    $3,250 million at July 2, 2010 and $2,315 million
    at July 3, 2009. The determination of backlog involves
    substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer
    requirements contracts and development and production contracts
    of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products
    and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the
    case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. We define
    unfunded backlog as primarily unfilled firm contract value for
    which funding has not yet been authorized or, in the case of
    U.S. Government agencies, appropriated, including the value
    of contract options in cases of material contracts that have
    options we believe are probable of being exercised. We do not
    include potential task or delivery orders under IDIQ contracts
    in our backlog. In fiscal 2012, we expect to fill approximately
    75 percent of our total funded backlog as of July 1,
    2011. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or
    that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular
    period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and
    program cancellations, which are beyond our control. Additional
    information with regard to the backlog of each of our segments
    is provided under “Item 1. Business —
    Description of Business by Segment” of this Report.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $983 million in fiscal 2011,
    $1,047 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,003 million in
    fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which included research and development for commercial
    products and services and independent research and development
    related to government products and services, as well as concept
    formulation studies and bid and proposal efforts, were
    approximately $336 million in fiscal 2011,
    $326 million in fiscal 2010 and $244 million in fiscal
    2009. A portion of our independent research and development
    costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process
    under U.S. Government contractual arrangements.
    Company-sponsored research and product development costs not
    otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. The
    portion of total research, development and engineering
    expenditures that was not company-sponsored was funded by the
    U.S. Government and is included in our revenue.
    Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $647 million



in fiscal 2011, $721 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $759 million in fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored research is
    directed to the development of new products and services and to
    building technological capability in selected communications and
    electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research
    helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. All of
    our segments maintain their own engineering and new product
    development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
    advanced-technology departments. As of July 1, 2011, we
    employed approximately 7,100 engineers and scientists and are
    continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
    our operating segments available for all other operating
    segments.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the
    aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We routinely apply
    for and own a large and valuable portfolio of patents, trade
    secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks,
    copyrights and other intellectual property. We also license
    intellectual property to and from third parties. As of
    July 1, 2011, we held approximately 950 U.S. patents
    and 850 foreign patents, and had approximately 500
    U.S. patent applications pending and 1,140 foreign patent
    applications pending. Unpatented research, development and
    engineering skills also make an important contribution to our
    business. While our intellectual property rights in the
    aggregate are important to our business and the operations of
    our operating segments, we do not consider our business or any
    operating segment to be materially dependent upon any single
    patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any
    group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual
    property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing
    program and have entered into a number of licenses and
    cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income.
    Although existing license agreements have generated income in
    past years and may do so in the future, there can be no
    assurances we will enter into additional income-producing
    license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to
    protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our
    patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other
    proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or
    circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For
    further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property,
    see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. With
    regard to patents relating to our Government Communications
    Systems segment, the U.S. Government often has an
    irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to
    which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to
    use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar
    arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of
    inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous
    trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also
    considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic
    and international laws and regulations designed to protect the
    environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions.
    The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common
    within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve.
    We believe that we have complied with these requirements and
    that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Based upon currently available information, we do not expect
    expenditures over the next several years to protect the
    environment and to comply with current environmental laws and
    regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending
    climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords,
    to have a material impact on our competitive position or
    financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such
    expenditures will not exceed current expectations. If future
    treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent
    requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may
    be higher than our present estimates of those expenditures. We
    have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control
    equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste
    minimization and prevention goals. We did not spend material
    amounts on environmental capital projects in fiscal 2011, fiscal
    2010 or fiscal 2009. A portion of our environmental expenditures
    relates to discontinued operations for which we have retained
    certain environmental liabilities. We currently expect that
    amounts to be spent for environmental-related capital projects
    will not be material in fiscal 2012. These amounts may increase
    in future years. Additional information regarding environmental
    and regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Report and in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment, in particular, is
    subject to domestic and international requirements requiring

end-of-life

management

and/or

restricting materials in products delivered to customers,
    including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and
    Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of certain
    Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted
    similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not
    applicable to most equipment produced by our Government
    Communications Systems



and RF Communications segments. We believe that we have complied
    with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect
    to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend
    to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our
    future products.

Broadcast and wireless communications (whether TV, radio,
    satellite or telecommunications) are also subject to
    governmental regulation. Equipment produced by our Integrated
    Network Solutions and RF Communications segments, in particular,
    is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid
    interference among users of radio and television frequencies and
    to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment.
    Additionally, our managed satellite and terrestrial
    communications solutions operations hold licenses for very small
    aperture terminals (“VSATs”) and satellite earth
    stations, which authorize operation of networks and teleports.
    We are also required to comply with technical operating and
    licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and
    operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products
    and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and
    services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum
    also could impact our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Raw
    Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
    as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
    numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
    electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
    plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
    dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
    of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
    and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
    restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
    and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
    one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
    of a particular item or because of local content preference
    requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
    While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
    of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
    materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
    materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced
    component shortages from vendors as a result of natural
    disasters, or the RoHS environmental regulations in the European
    Union or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. These
    events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain
    electronic components (such as lead-free components), resulting
    in industry-wide supply chain shortages. To date, these
    component shortages have not had a material adverse effect on
    our business. For further discussion of risks relating to
    subcontractors and suppliers, see “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    contract awards and the timing and availability of
    U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product
    deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

We employed approximately 16,900 employees at the end of
    fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 15,800 employees at
    the end of fiscal 2010. Approximately 88 percent of our
    employees as of the end of fiscal 2011 were located in the
    United States. A significant number of employees in our
    Government Communications Systems segment possess a
    U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a
    number of independent contractors. None of our employees in the
    United States is represented by a labor union. In certain
    international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by
    workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we
    believe that our relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that we
    believe could impact our business and future results in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this
    Report. In addition, our business, operating results, cash flows
    and financial condition are subject to, and could be materially
    adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties,
    including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of
    which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
    recent results or our anticipated future results.

We
    depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of
    our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding priorities could have adverse
    consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government
    customers. The percentage of our net revenue that was derived
    from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, was approximately
    72 percent in fiscal 2011, 75 percent in fiscal 2010
    and 74 percent in fiscal 2009. Therefore, any significant
    disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the
    U.S. Government would significantly reduce our revenue. Our
    U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed
    by other government contractors for limited resources and for
    uncertain levels of funding. Our competitors continuously engage
    in efforts to expand their business relationships with the
    U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
    future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other
    contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we
    seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through
    competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly
    relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to a
    competitive bidding process, including IDIQ, GWAC, General
    Services Administration (“GSA”) Schedule and other
    multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition
    and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly competitive
    markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more
    specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to
    continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain
    task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the
    competitive bidding process involves significant cost and
    managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that
    may not be awarded to us, and the risk that we may fail to
    accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill
    any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, we may
    experience significant expense or delay, contract modification
    or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting
    or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding.
    Budget decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of
    our control and have long-term consequences for our business. A
    shift in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase
    in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs (for
    example, through “in-sourcing”), or a reduction in
    total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse
    consequences on our future business.

We
    depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often
    are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and
    heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to
    fund one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact
    on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
    implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
    and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
    is subject to Congressional appropriations.



Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated
    in connection with major procurements, Congress generally
    appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are
    typically made available for obligation over the course of three
    years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
    initially, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress
    authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding
    for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
    anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which
    could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
    termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
    funds to a program that already has been started could result in
    lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such
    audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any
    costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract
    will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must
    be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs
    we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know
    the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be
    required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon
    completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit
    findings could also result in termination of a contract,
    forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
    suspension or prohibition from doing business with the
    U.S. Government.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain
    provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without
    prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon
    the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time
    of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
    U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
    these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
    would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
    backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
    U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
    our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
    our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
    large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
    regulations and a variety of socio-economic and other
    requirements. These requirements, although customary in
    U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
    compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
    thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
    on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
    regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties,
    repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or
    debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
    subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
    debarment are violations of various laws, including those
    related to procurement integrity, export control,
    U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
    protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper
    recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
    U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
    of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
    could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for
    future U.S. Government contracts.

We
    enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses
    in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in
    inflation.

We have a number of firm fixed-price contracts. These contracts
    allow us to benefit from cost savings, but they carry the risk
    of potential cost overruns because we assume all of the cost
    burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose
    money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can
    expose us to potentially large losses because the
    U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a
    project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of
    its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or
    foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of
    the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new
    technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen
    events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the
    price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost
    overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less
    favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. The United
    States also may experience a significant increase in inflation.
    A significant increase in inflation rates could have a
    significant adverse impact on the profitability of these
    contracts. Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or
    specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less
    favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated
    damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its
    right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have
    provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we
    fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not
    realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are
    dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our
    contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our
    financial results. The potential impact of such risk on our
    financial results would increase if the mix of our contracts and
    programs shifted toward a greater percentage of firm fixed-price
    contracts.



We
    could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber
    attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant
    disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we
    operate for certain of our customers.

We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach,
    whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the
    Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to

e-mails,

persons inside our organization or persons with access to
    systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption
    of our IT networks and related systems. We face an added risk of
    a security breach or other significant disruption of the IT
    networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate
    and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve
    managing and protecting information relating to national
    security and other sensitive government functions. The risk of a
    security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack
    or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign
    governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number,
    intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions
    from around the world have increased. As a communications and IT
    company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a
    heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats
    to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’
    proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and
    related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that
    we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These
    types of information and IT networks and related systems are
    critical to the operation of our business and essential to our
    ability to perform

day-to-day

operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations
    of certain of our customers. Although we make significant
    efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of
    information and IT networks and related systems, and we have
    implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security
    breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our
    security efforts and measures will be effective or that
    attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be
    successful or damaging. Even the most well protected
    information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially
    vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly
    cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the
    future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are
    constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until
    launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be
    detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the
    resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks.
    Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or
    to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative
    measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely
    mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant
    disruption involving these types of information and IT networks
    and related systems could:

•

Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and
    therefore our operations

and/or

those
    of certain of our customers;

•

Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss,
    theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential,
    sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our
    customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to
    compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise
    harmful purposes and outcomes;

•

Compromise national security and other sensitive government
    functions;

•

Require significant management attention and resources to remedy
    the damages that result;

•

Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits,
    penalties or termination; or

•

Damage our reputation among our customers (particularly agencies
    of the U.S. Government and potential customers of Cyber
    Integrated Solutions) and the public generally,

Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We
    derive a significant portion of our revenue from international
    operations and are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
    States. In fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, revenue
    from products and services exported from the U.S. or
    manufactured or rendered abroad was 22 percent,
    14 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of our total
    revenue. Approximately 33 percent of our international
    business in fiscal 2011 was transacted in local currency. Losses
    resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect
    our results. We expect that international revenue will continue
    to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also,
    a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and
    an increasing portion of our business activity is being
    conducted in, less-developed countries. We are subject to risks
    of doing business internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;



•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including business or
    operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or
    embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using international dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed
    organization and culturally diverse workforces, including
    compliance with local laws and practices;

•

Difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held
    abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

Our
    reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the
    improper conduct of our employees, agents or business
    partners.

We have implemented compliance controls, policies and procedures
    designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from being
    committed by our employees, agents or business partners that
    would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate,
    including laws governing payments to government officials (such
    as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and to detect any such
    reckless or criminal acts committed. We cannot ensure, however,
    that our controls, policies and procedures will prevent or
    detect all such reckless or criminal acts. If not prevented,
    such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to civil or
    criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties
    and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    conduct business, our results of operations and our reputation.

We may
    not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to
    conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent
    proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and
    authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before
    we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies
    outside of the United States. For example, the
    U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least

15-60 days,

depending on the size and location of the sale, prior to
    authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to
    foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action
    to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we
    will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary
    licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or
    delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability
    to sell products or technologies outside of the United States
    could negatively impact our results of operations and financial
    condition.

The
    continued effects of the general downturn in the global economy
    and the U.S. Government’s budget deficits and national debt
    could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results
    or financial condition.

There has been a general downturn in the global economy and the
    economies of the United States and many foreign countries in
    which we do business continue to show weakness. Although
    governments worldwide, including the U.S. Government, have
    initiated sweeping economic plans, we are unable to predict the
    impact, severity and duration of these economic events. The
    continuing effects of the general downturn in the global economy
    and the U.S. Government’s budget deficits and national
    debt could have an adverse impact on our business, operations
    results or financial condition in a number of ways. Possible
    effects of these economic conditions include the following:

•

The U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on,
    reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in
    which we participate;

•

The U.S. Government may be unable complete its budget
    process before the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and
    thus would be required either to shut down or to be funded
    pursuant to a “continuing resolution” that authorizes
    agencies of the U.S. Government to continue operations but
    does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which
    could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for
    products and services we provide. While this historically has
    not had a material adverse impact on our business, operating
    results or financial condition, if the U.S. Government
    budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation
    under a continuing resolution, it may decrease our revenues,
    profitability or cash flows or otherwise have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.



•

We may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash
    flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or
    other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers
    and prospective customers (including U.S. Federal, state
    and local governments);

•

We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other
    problems associated with financial constraints faced by our
    suppliers and subcontractors; and

•

We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with
    future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit
    facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing
    our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or
    financing activities.

Our
    future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products, services and technologies that achieve market
    acceptance in our current and future markets.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized
    by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry
    standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of
    factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target
    markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products and services;

•

Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products and services from
    those of our competitors; and

•

Develop, manufacture and bring cost-effective offerings to
    market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
    we will need to continue to develop new products, services and
    technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial
    resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our
    attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be
    sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely
    development of new products, services or technologies. Due to
    the design complexity of some of our products, services and
    technologies, we may experience delays in completing development
    and introducing new products, services or technologies in the
    future. Any delays could result in increased costs of
    development or redirect resources from other projects. In
    addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our
    products, services or technologies will develop as we currently
    anticipate. The failure of our products, services or
    technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly
    reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot
    be sure that our competitors will not develop competing
    products, services or technologies that gain market acceptance
    in advance of our products, services or technologies, or that
    our competitors will not develop new products, services or
    technologies that cause our existing products, services or
    technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could
    adversely affect our results of operations. The future direction
    of the domestic and global economies, including its impact on
    customer demand, also will have a significant impact on our
    overall performance.

We
    participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and
    expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are
    subject to uncertain economic conditions. As a result, it is
    difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in
    which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting
    and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
    markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or
    guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures
    even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant
    investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated
    benefits.

We
    cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events,
    but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate,
    our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our
    profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in the Middle East and
    Asia and the potential for further conflicts and future
    terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events
    throughout the world have created economic and political
    uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operations and profitability. These matters cause
    uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance markets
    and may increase significantly the political, economic and
    social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate.
    These matters also have caused the premiums charged for our
    insurance coverages to increase and may cause further increases
    or some coverages to be unavailable altogether.



We
    have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that
    involve significant risks and uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions,
    including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or
    fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other
    acquisition risks;

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations, including combining product and service offerings,
    and in entering into new markets in which we are not
    experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while
    maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Difficulty in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure,
    which may include multiple legacy systems from various
    acquisitions and integrating software code;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    strategic acquisitions do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

Disputes
    with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors
    to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our
    components, parts or services, could cause our products or
    services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or
    unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. We may have
    disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding
    the quality and timeliness of work performed by the
    subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our
    failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders
    under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a
    subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor’s failure
    to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain
    parts, components and services for many of our products and
    services which we source from other manufacturers or vendors.
    Some of our suppliers, from time to time, experience financial
    and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to
    supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that
    we require. Any inability to develop alternative sources of
    supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially
    impair our ability to manufacture and deliver products and
    services to our customers. We can give no assurances that we
    will be free from disputes with our subcontractors, material
    supply problems or component, subsystems or services problems in
    the future. Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not
    be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials,
    components, subsystems and services they supply, which might
    result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty
    claims and could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
    protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
    often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be
    infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon
    those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual
    property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
    royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to
    obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us,
    or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain of our
    products, services and solutions. Our success depends in large
    part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of
    patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how,
    confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to
    establish and protect our intellectual property rights. If we
    fail to successfully protect and enforce these rights, our
    competitive position could suffer. Our pending patent and
    trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or
    competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents
    or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not
    provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be
    required to spend significant resources to monitor and police
    our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect
    infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before
    we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our
    technology or develop competing technologies.



The
    outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is
    unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and, from
    time to time, are involved in a number of arbitrations. These
    actions may divert financial and management resources that would
    otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can
    be given that the results of these or new matters will be
    favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or
    arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We
    face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
    and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
    relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
    defense, technology and communications systems and products. New
    technologies associated with these systems and products may be
    untested or unproven. Components of certain of the defense
    systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous.
    Failures of satellites, missile systems, air traffic control
    systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the
    potential to cause loss of life and extensive property damage.
    In most circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
    risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
    to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
    substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
    possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
    risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
    incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
    insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for
    which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively
    affect our standing among our customers and the public, thereby
    making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
    could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
    insurance in the future.

Changes
    in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a
    number of factors including:

•

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax
    returns;

•

Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes,
    including write-offs of acquired in-process research and
    development and impairment of goodwill in connection with
    acquisitions;

•

Changes in available tax credits;

•

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the
    interpretation of such tax laws; and

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
    tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We
    have significant operations in Florida and other locations that
    could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a
    natural disaster or other significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
    Government Communications Systems segment are located in
    Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Our worldwide
    operations and operations of our suppliers could be subject to
    natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including
    hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires,
    water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical
    epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts,
    telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and
    manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural
    disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or
    interruptions to our operations or the operations of our
    suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers;
    destruction of facilities;

and/or

loss
    of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and
    expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in the regulatory framework under which our managed satellite
    and terrestrial communications solutions operations are operated
    could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Our domestic satellite and terrestrial communications solutions
    are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are
    therefore subject to lighter regulation by the Federal
    Communications Commission (the “FCC”) and other
    Federal, state and local agencies than if provided on a common
    carrier basis. Our international satellite and



terrestrial communications solutions operations are regulated by
    governments of various countries other than the United States
    and by other international authorities. The regulatory regimes
    applicable to our international satellite and terrestrial
    communications solutions operations frequently require that we
    obtain and maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our
    operations in accordance with prescribed standards. Compliance
    with such requirements may inhibit our ability to quickly expand
    our operations into new countries, including in circumstances in
    which such expansion is required in order to provide
    uninterrupted service to existing customers with mobile
    operations as they move to new locations on short notice.
    Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could
    subject us to various penalties or sanctions. The adoption of
    new laws or regulations, changes to the existing domestic or
    international regulatory framework, new interpretations of the
    laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material
    limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially
    harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We
    rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our
    managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions, and
    any bandwidth constraints could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

In our managed satellite and terrestrial communications
    solutions operations, we compete for satellite bandwidth with
    other commercial entities, such as other satellite
    communications services providers and broadcasting companies,
    and with governmental entities, such as the military. In certain
    markets and at certain times, satellite bandwidth may be limited

and/or

pricing of satellite bandwidth could be subject to competitive
    pressure. In such cases, we may be unable to secure sufficient
    bandwidth needed to provide our managed satellite communications
    services, either at favorable rates or at all. This inability
    could harm our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Changes
    in future business conditions could cause business investments
    and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in
    substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results
    of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence
    procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic
    objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions
    and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately 39 percent of our recorded total assets as of
    July 1, 2011. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded
    goodwill amounts annually, as well as when we change reportable
    segments and when events or circumstances indicate there may be
    an impairment. The annual impairment test is based on several
    factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected
    reportable segment cash flows or changes in market conditions
    may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. For
    additional information on accounting policies we have in place
    for goodwill impairment, see our discussion under “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations” of this Report and

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

in the Notes.

We
    must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so
    could seriously harm us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract significant
    numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding
    security clearances, to support our growth and to replace
    individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or
    for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified
    personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time
    in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or
    training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or
    could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts
    if our needs for such employees were unmet.

In addition, we are currently undertaking a search for a
    successor chief executive officer, which is a critical
    management position. The search for and transition to a
    successor chief executive officer may result in disruptions to
    our business and uncertainty among investors, employees and
    others concerning our future direction and performance. It also
    may be more difficult for us to recruit and retain other
    personnel until a successor chief executive officer is
    identified and the transition is completed. Any such disruptions
    and uncertainty, as well as the failure to successfully
    identify, attract

and/or

retain a successor chief executive officer or other executives
    and key employees could have an adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
    in Melbourne, Florida. As of July 1, 2011, we operated
    approximately 170 locations in the United States, Canada,
    Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
    8.1 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
    research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
    space, of which approximately 5.1 million square feet were
    owned and approximately 3.0 million square feet were
    leased. There are no material encumbrances on any of our
    facilities. Our leased facilities are, for the most part,
    occupied under leases for remaining terms ranging from one month
    to 10 years, a majority of which can be terminated or
    renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at our option. As
    of July 1, 2011, we had major operations at the following
    locations:

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
    leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
    and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
    While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
    not considered significant. The facilities owned by our RF
    Communications segment include a new manufacturing facility
    located in Rochester, New York. The facilities owned by our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment include our new Cyber
    Integration Center located in Harrisonburg, Virginia. We
    frequently review our anticipated requirements for facilities
    and will, from time to time, acquire additional facilities,
    expand existing facilities, and dispose of existing facilities
    or parts thereof, as management deems necessary. For more
    information about our lease obligations, see

Note 18:
    Lease Commitments

in the Notes. Our facilities and other
    properties are generally maintained in good operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal
    incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are,
    and were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and
    litigation or arbitration is commenced by or against us arising
    from or related to matters, including, but not limited to:
    product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks, trade
    secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee
    disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the prior sale or
    use of products containing asbestos or other restricted
    materials; breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed
    amounts against us may be substantial but may not bear any
    reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
    of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We record accruals
    for losses related to those matters against us that we consider
    to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
    contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
    legal costs generally are expensed when incurred. While it is
    not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
    certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
    disposed of or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
    information, in the opinion of management, settlements,
    arbitration awards and final judgments, if any, which are
    considered probable of being



rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
    July 1, 2011 are reserved against, covered by insurance or
    would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. Government
    Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such
    as us, are engaged in supplying goods and services to the
    U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore
    dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
    allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
    U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government contracts
    typically involve long lead times for design and development,
    are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
    may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the
    U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
    design and production of complex and technologically advanced
    products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government as either a prime
    contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes
    may arise between the prime contractor and the
    U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
    subcontractors and may result in litigation or arbitration
    between the contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
    policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
    U.S. Government, and specific agency acquisition
    regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. As a
    U.S. Government contractor, our contract costs are audited
    and reviewed on a continuing basis by the Defense Contract Audit
    Agency (“DCAA”). The DCAA also reviews the adequacy
    of, and a U.S. Government contractor’s compliance
    with, the contractor’s internal control systems and
    policies, including the contractor’s accounting,
    purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management
    information systems. In addition to these routine audits, from
    time to time, we may, either individually or in conjunction with
    other U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits
    and investigations by other agencies of the
    U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are
    conducted to determine if our performance and administration of
    our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable
    contractual requirements and procurement and other applicable
    Federal laws and regulations. These investigations may be
    conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict the
    outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
    resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
    against us, our officers or employees. Under present
    U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, if
    indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement or other
    Federal laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our
    operating divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines,
    penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain
    findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
    debarment from eligibility for awards of new
    U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension
    or debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because
    of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition,
    our export privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension
    or revocation of our export privileges also would have a
    material adverse effect on us. For further discussion of risks
    relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

International.

As an international company, we
    are, from time to time, the subject of investigations relating
    to our international operations, including under the
    U.S. export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous
    U.S. Federal, state and international environmental laws
    and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time
    in investigations or litigation of various potential
    environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or
    former facilities or remediation as a result of past activities
    (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From
    time to time, we receive notices from the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or
    international environmental agencies that we are a potentially
    responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”)

and/or

equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for
    cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us,
    sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances
    attributable to us from past operations. We own, previously
    owned or are currently named as a potentially responsible party
    at 14 such sites, excluding sites as to which our records
    disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been
    finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict the
    outcome of many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our
    management, any payments we may be required to make as a result
    of such claims in existence at July 1, 2011 will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows. Additional information regarding
    environmental matters is set forth in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes, which
    information is incorporated herein by reference, and in
    “Item 1. Business — Environmental and Other
    Regulations” of this Report.

HSTX Securities Litigation.

HSTX and certain
    of its current and former officers and directors, including
    certain current Harris officers, were named as defendants in a
    federal securities class action complaint filed on
    September 15, 2008 in the United States District Court (the
    “Court”) for the District of Delaware by plaintiff



Norfolk County Retirement System on behalf of an alleged class
    of purchasers of HSTX securities from January 29, 2007 to
    July 30, 2008, including shareholders of Stratex Networks,
    Inc. (“Stratex”) who exchanged shares of Stratex for
    shares of HSTX as part of the combination between Stratex and
    our former Microwave Communications Division to form HSTX.
    Similar complaints were filed in the Court on October 6,
    2008 and October 30, 2008. The complaints were consolidated
    in a slightly expanded complaint filed on July 29, 2009
    that, among other things, added Harris Corporation as a
    defendant. This action relates to public disclosures made by
    HSTX on January 30, 2007 and July 30, 2008, which
    included the restatement of HSTX’s financial statements for
    the first three fiscal quarters of its fiscal 2008 (the quarters
    ended March 28, 2008, December 28, 2007 and
    September 28, 2007) and for its fiscal years ended
    June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005 due
    to accounting errors. The consolidated complaint alleged
    violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the
    Exchange Act and of

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, as well as violations of Section 11
    and Section 15 of the Securities Act, and sought, among
    other relief, determinations that the action is a proper class
    action, unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable
    attorneys’ fees and costs. On June 21, 2011, the Court
    issued an order preliminarily approving a settlement between the
    parties. A settlement fairness hearing is scheduled for
    September 16, 2011. We do not expect the settlement to have
    a material impact on our results of operations, financial
    condition or cash flows.

Market
    Information and Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and
    traded on the NYSE, under the ticker symbol “HRS.”
    According to the records of our transfer agent, as of
    August 26, 2011, there were approximately
    5,860 holders of record of our common stock. The high and
    low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the NYSE
    consolidated transactions reporting system and the dividends
    paid on our common stock for each quarterly period in our last
    two fiscal years are reported below:

On August 26, 2011, the last sale price of our common stock
    as reported in the NYSE consolidated transactions reporting
    system was $37.69 per share.

Dividends

The cash dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in
    our last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
    July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.25 per
    share to $.28 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $1.12 per share and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.28
    per share, which will be paid on September 16, 2011 to
    holders of record on September 7, 2011. Our annualized cash
    dividend rate was $1.00 per share, $.88 per share and $.80 per
    share in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.
    Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June,
    September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends
    will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no
    assurances. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant.

Harris
    Stock Performance Graph

The following performance graph and table do not constitute
    soliciting material and the performance graph and table should
    not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other
    previous or future filings by us under the Securities Act or the
    Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically
    incorporate the performance graph and table by reference
    therein.

The performance graph and table below compare the five-year
    cumulative total return of our common stock with the comparable
    five-year cumulative total returns of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index (“S&P
    500”), the Standard & Poor’s 500 Information
    Technology Sector Index (“S&P 500 Information
    Technology”) and the Standard & Poor’s 500
    Aerospace & Defense Index (“S&P 500
    Aerospace & Defense”). The figures in the
    performance graph and table below assume an initial investment
    of $100 at the close of business on June 30, 2006 in
    Harris, the S&P 500, the S&P 500 Information
    Technology and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense
    and the reinvestment of all dividends, including, with respect
    to our common stock, the Spin-off dividend. For purposes of
    calculating the cumulative total return of our common stock, the
    then-current market value of the HSTX shares distributed in the
    Spin-off was deemed to have been reinvested on the May 27,
    2009 Spin-off date in shares of our common stock.

We have included the S&P 500 because we are a company
    within the S&P 500, and we have included the S&P 500
    Information Technology as a relevant published industry index.
    In addition, we have included the S&P 500
    Aerospace & Defense because we believe that this index
    is representative of certain other companies competing with us
    or otherwise participating in markets we serve, and therefore
    may also provide a fair basis for comparison with us and be
    relevant to an assessment of our performance.

Sales of
    Unregistered Securities

During fiscal 2011, we did not issue or sell any unregistered
    securities.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 5,325,690 shares of our
    common stock under our repurchase program at an average price
    per share of $46.92, excluding commissions. During fiscal 2010,
    we repurchased 4,779,411 shares of our common stock under
    our repurchase program at an average price per share of $41.81,
    excluding commissions. The level of our repurchases depends on a
    number of factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject
    to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other
    factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or
    discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled
    and retired.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    (“MD&A”) is intended to assist in an
    understanding of Harris. MD&A is provided as a supplement
    to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
    entirety by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements
    and accompanying Notes appearing elsewhere in this Report.
    Except for the historical information contained herein, the
    discussions in MD&A contain forward-looking statements that
    involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ
    materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause
    or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
    to, those discussed below in MD&A under
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
    Future Results.”

The following is a list of the sections of MD&A, together
    with our perspective on the contents of these sections of
    MD&A, which we hope will assist in reading these pages:

•

Business Considerations

— a general
    description of our businesses; the value drivers of our
    businesses and our strategy for achieving value; fiscal 2011
    results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key
    indicators; and industry-wide opportunities, challenges and
    risks that are relevant to us in the defense, government and
    commercial markets.

•

BUSINESS
    CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
    technology company serving government and commercial markets in
    more than 150 countries. We are dedicated to developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets. Our company
    generates revenue, income and cash flows by developing,
    manufacturing and selling communications products and software
    as well as providing related services. We sell directly to our
    customers, the largest of which are U.S. Government
    customers and their prime contractors, and we utilize agents and
    intermediaries to sell and market some products and services,
    especially in international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve. As previously
    reported and as also discussed in

Note 1: Significant
    Accounting Policies

and

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we
    realigned our operations to provide increased market focus and
    address certain high-growth commercial markets. As a result of
    the realignment, effective for the third quarter of



fiscal 2011, our reportable operating segment structure changed,
    and we now report the financial results of our continuing
    operations in the following three operating segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, which is unchanged by the
    realignment and continues to be comprised of
    (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International
    Tactical Communications (“Tactical Communications”)
    and (ii) Public Safety and Professional Communications;

•

Our Integrated Network Solutions segment, which is comprised of
    (i) IT Services, (ii) Managed Satellite and
    Terrestrial Communications Solutions, (iii) Healthcare
    Solutions, (iv) Cyber Integrated Solutions and
    (v) Broadcast and New Media Solutions; and

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, which is now
    comprised of (i) Civil Programs, (ii) Defense Programs
    and (iii) National Intelligence Programs.

Our new reportable operating segment structure reflects that IT
    Services, Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications
    Solutions, Healthcare Solutions and Cyber Integrated Solutions
    are no longer under our Government Communications Systems
    segment, but instead have been realigned with Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions (formerly a separate reportable segment called
    Broadcast Communications) to form our new Integrated Network
    Solutions segment. Our RF Communications segment did not change.
    The historical results, discussion and presentation of our
    operating segments as set forth in this Report have been
    adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes to our
    reportable operating segment structure for all periods presented
    in this Report.

Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in
    connection with the May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a
    taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all the shares
    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated our former HSTX
    operating segment. Our historical financial results have been
    restated to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented in this Report, and unless otherwise
    specified, disclosures in this Report relate solely to our
    continuing operations. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

in the Notes for additional information regarding
    discontinued operations.

Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or
    “Non-operating loss” line items in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.

Value
    Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for Achieving
    Value

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
    Corporation will be the

best-in-class

global provider of mission-critical

assured
    communications

®

systems and services to both government and commercial
    customers, combining advanced technology and application
    knowledge.” We are committed to our mission statement, and
    we believe that executing our mission statement creates value.
    Consistent with this commitment to effective execution, we
    currently focus on these key value drivers:

•

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all segments by
    introducing new technology-based products, expanding our
    addressable markets and customer base, and investing in
    international markets and channels;

•

Leveraging technology, know-how and capabilities transfer across
    business segments;

•

Achieving operating efficiencies and cost reductions by
    delivering on supply chain and operations excellence;

•

Making strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolios and to gain access to new
    markets; and

•

Maintaining a strong financial foundation.

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all
    segments:

We plan to focus on continued
    profitable revenue growth by focusing on the following
    strategies in each segment:

RF Communications:

Continue to leverage our
    reputation and position as a leading provider of secure tactical
    radio communications and embedded high-grade encryption
    solutions for military and government organizations and secure
    communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility
    and transportation markets. Capitalize on the opportunity to
    transform the legacy narrowband market into the network-enabled
    wideband market of the future. Continue to increase our
    international presence, product offerings, solutions, support
    and services.

Integrated Network Solutions:

Provide
    mission-critical

end-to-end

IT services; managed satellite and terrestrial communications
    solutions; standards-based healthcare interoperability and image
    management solutions; cyber integration and cloud application
    hosting solutions; and digital media management solutions to
    support government, energy, healthcare, enterprise and broadcast
    customers. Leverage our IT services business scale and
    capabilities in each of the above mentioned vertical markets.
    Continue to increase our international presence, product
    offerings, solutions, support and services.



Government Communications Systems:

Conduct
    advanced research and produce, integrate and support highly
    reliable, net-centric communications and information technology
    that solve the mission-critical challenges of our civilian,
    defense and intelligence government customers, primarily the
    U.S. Government. Leverage core capabilities such as SATCOM,
    ground systems, avionics, data links, mission-critical networks,
    ISR and space systems.

Leveraging technology, know-how and capabilities transfer
    across business segments:

One of our
    strengths is our ability to transfer technology, know-how and
    capabilities among business segments and focus our research and
    development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole. An
    example of this is our FAME product that utilizes COTS software
    and hardware developed by our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment and applying that technology to government applications
    where there is a need to gather, store, distribute and analyze
    increasingly large amounts of ISR data. The partnering of
    Broadcast and New Media Solutions and IT Services to provide
    fully integrated solutions for the Orlando Magic and 7-Eleven is
    another example. Another area of focus is cross-selling through
    vertical market sales channels and joint pursuits by multiple
    segments. Other corporate initiatives include joint
    international market channel development, such as shared
    distributors and coordinated

“go-to-market”

strategies.

Achieving operating efficiencies and cost
    reductions:

Our principal focus areas for
    operating efficiencies and cost management are: reducing
    procurement costs through an emphasis on coordinated supply
    chain management; reducing product costs through dedicated
    engineering resources focused on product design; improving
    manufacturing efficiencies across all segments; and optimizing
    facility utilization.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another
    key value driver is making strategic acquisitions and
    investments to build or complement the strengths in our core
    businesses, more quickly access adjacent markets, and gain
    access to new markets. On July 30, 2010, we acquired
    CapRock, a global provider of mission-critical, managed
    satellite communications services for the government, energy and
    maritime industries. The acquisition of CapRock increased the
    breadth of our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. On April 4, 2011,
    we acquired Schlumberger GCS, a provider of satellite and
    terrestrial communications services for the worldwide energy
    market. We report CapRock and Schlumberger GCS as part of
    Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions under
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment. Also on April 4,
    2011, we acquired Carefx, a provider of interoperability
    workflow solutions for government and commercial healthcare
    providers. This acquisition expanded our presence in government
    healthcare, provided entry into the commercial healthcare market
    and is expected to leverage the healthcare interoperability
    workflow products offered by Carefx and the broader scale of
    enterprise intelligence solutions and services that we provide.
    We report Carefx as part of Healthcare Solutions under our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we acquired Wireless Systems, an established
    provider of mission-critical wireless communications systems for
    law enforcement, fire and rescue, public service, utility and
    transportation markets. We report Wireless Systems as Public
    Safety and Professional Communications under our RF
    Communications segment.

Maintaining a strong financial
    foundation:

We believe our strong capital
    position, access to key financial markets, ability to raise
    funds at a low effective cost and overall low cost of borrowing
    provide a strong financial foundation from which to operate. We
    had $366.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of
    July 1, 2011 and had $833.1 million of cash flows
    provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011. Our cash is
    not restricted and can be used for internal investments, capital
    expenditures, strategic acquisitions, repurchases of our common
    stock or to pay dividends to our shareholders. On July 30,
    2011, our Board of Directors approved the $1 billion New
    Repurchase Program that replaced the 2009 Repurchase Program,
    which had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately
    $200 million. The New Repurchase Program does not have a
    stated expiration date. We currently expect to repurchase up to
    $500 million in shares under the New Repurchase Program by
    the end of calendar year 2011. The New Repurchase Program is
    expected to result in repurchases well in excess of the dilutive
    effect of shares issued under our share-based incentive plans.
    However, the level of repurchases depends on a number of
    factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    Share repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash
    and commercial paper. Repurchases under the New Repurchase
    Program may be made through open market purchases, private
    transactions, transactions structured through investment banking
    institutions, or any combination thereof. The timing, volume and
    nature of share repurchases are subject to market conditions,
    applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our
    discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
    Additional information regarding share repurchases during fiscal
    2011 and our Repurchase Programs is set forth above under
    “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities” of this Report.



Key
    Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
    key indicators of value, such as: income from continuing
    operations and income from continuing operations per diluted
    common share; revenue; income from continuing operations as a
    percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating
    activities; return on average assets; and return on average
    equity. The measure of our success is reflected in our results
    of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators
    as discussed below:

Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations Key
    Indicators:

Income from continuing
    operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common
    share, revenue, and income from continuing operations as a
    percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value
    drivers:

•

    fiscal 2011 from $5.2 billion in fiscal 2010; and

•

Income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue
    decreased to 9.9 percent in fiscal 2011 from
    10.8 percent in fiscal 2010.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below
    in this Report for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key
    Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
    activities, return on average assets and return on average
    equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers:

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $833.1 million in fiscal 2011 from $802.7 million in
    fiscal 2010;

•

Return on average assets (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of total assets at
    the beginning and ending of the fiscal year) decreased to
    10.8 percent in fiscal 2011 from 12.2 percent in
    fiscal 2010; and

•

Return on average equity (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the
    beginning and ending of the fiscal year) decreased to
    25.0 percent in fiscal 2011 from 27.7 percent in
    fiscal 2010.

    and Financial Strategies” below in this Report for more
    information.

Industry-Wide
    Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Department of Defense:

The DoD’s
    U.S. Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2012 budget
    proposal reflects continued investment in national security
    priorities (including cyber security) and continues efforts to
    rebalance military forces to focus on both today’s wars as
    well as potential future conflicts. Building on efforts begun in
    GFY 2010, the DoD will continue to implement its acquisition
    reforms and modernize key weapons systems to provide service
    members with the best technology to meet battlefield needs. We
    expect the U.S. Government to remain committed to funding
    intelligence, information superiority, special operations,
    warfighter support and cyber security, although there can be no
    assurance it will do so.

The DoD’s $671 billion GFY 2012 budget request is
    approximately 3.1% less than GFY 2010 enacted levels of
    $692 billion and approximately 5.3% less than the
    $708 billion GFY 2011 budget request. The GFY 2012 budget
    request includes $553 billion for base defense programs
    compared with $549 billion for base defense programs in the
    GFY 2011 budget request, and includes $118 billion for
    overseas contingency operations (“OCO”) compared with
    $159 billion for OCO in the GFY 2011 budget request,
    reflecting the winding down of military operations in Iraq and
    Afghanistan. Of the $118 billion GFY 2012 budget request
    for OCO, $107 billion is to support activities in
    Afghanistan and $11 billion is to support activities in
    Iraq.

The level of budget amounts allocated to DoD procurement
    accounts (“Procurement”), along with research,
    development, test and evaluation (“RDT&E”)
    components of the DoD budget, also are an important indicator of
    spending. The GFY 2012 budget requests for Procurement and
    RDT&E of $113 billion and $75 billion,
    respectively, are comparable to the GFY 2011 budget requests of
    $113 billion and $76 billion, respectively. Additionally, the
    DoD Operations and Maintenance account (“O&M”),
    which contains the bulk of funding for training, logistics,
    services and other logistical support, is an account of major
    importance. The DoD O&M budget request for GFY 2012 is
    $204 billion compared with the GFY 2011 budget request of
    $200 billion.



Over the longer term, DoD budgets are expected to decrease from
    current levels. While the DoD budget proposed by the
    Administration in February 2011 reflects a modest growth rate of
    approximately 2% from GFY 2012 through GFY 2021, recently
    enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires reductions of
    approximately $350 billion in Pentagon and national
    security agency budgets over the next ten years. Further, if a
    House-Senate committee is unsuccessful in reaching an agreement
    upon a deficit reduction plan by late November 2011, the
    recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation requires significant
    cuts in federal spending, which would be expected to result in
    deeper reductions to DoD budgets. Despite the expected lower
    levels of defense spending and the cancellation of particular
    platforms and programs, the types of products and services we
    offer appear to be a funding priority over the long term, which
    we believe will positively affect our future orders, sales,
    income and cash flows. Conversely, a significant decline in
    defense spending or a shift in funding priorities may have a
    negative effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows
    depending on the platforms and programs affected by such budget
    reductions or shifts in funding priorities.

Other Federal Markets:

Another current
    funding priority for the U.S. Government is the security of
    the United States, which includes better communications
    interplay among law enforcement, civil government agencies,
    intelligence agencies and our military services. Funding for
    investments in secure tactical communications, IT, information
    processing, healthcare IT, cyber security and additional
    communications assets and upgrades has remained solid. Another
    current priority of the U.S. Government is investments in
    productivity, cost reductions and upgrading to new IT systems
    and solutions. As a result, programs that promote these
    initiatives are also expected to receive funding, although there
    is no assurance that such funding will remain a priority. We
    provide products and services to a number of
    U.S. Government agencies including the FAA, NRO, NGA,
    Department of State, NSA, NOAA and others. For example, the FAA
    has announced its Next Generation Air Transportation System
    (“NextGen”) program to transform the entire
    U.S. air transport system to meet future demands and avoid
    gridlock in the sky and at airports.

State and Local:

We also provide
    products to state and local government agencies that are
    committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. Despite
    near-term budget pressures for state and local government
    agencies, we believe more normal spending patterns will resume
    in the long term as these agencies continue upgrading their
    technologies to improve communications and interoperability,
    although there can be no assurance they will do so.

International:

Recently, we have
    experienced a delay in international orders due to continuing
    political uncertainty in Northern Africa, the Middle East and
    Central Asia. However, over the longer term, we believe demand
    for communications and IT infrastructure technology and services
    in emerging global markets will remain robust. International
    markets continue to drive toward tactical communications
    upgrades and interoperability. We have also identified
    substantial opportunities with international governments with
    respect to their defense spending on national security and on
    tactical communications modernization and standardization
    programs, which we believe will positively affect our future
    orders, sales, income and cash flows.

Government Oversight and Risk:

As a
    U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to
    U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may
    investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with
    applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of
    those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could
    make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement
    regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a
    government contractor could result in that contractor being
    fined

and/or

suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new
    U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar
    government oversight exists in most other countries where we
    conduct business. We are currently not aware of any compliance
    audits or investigations that could result in a significant
    adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

We are also subject to other risks associated with
    U.S. Government business, including technological
    uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment
    of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are
    discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Commercial:

We are working to leverage
    our proven technologies for government applications into
    attractive commercial applications and expand in high-growth
    commercial markets. These markets include IT services, managed
    services, cyber integration and media solutions supporting
    energy, healthcare, broadcast and enterprise networks. We are
    trusted to run some of the United States’ largest, secure
    mission-critical information networks, and demand for
    communications and IT infrastructure in emerging global markets
    remains robust. As a cyber integrator, we see a large
    opportunity to help large corporations move their complex IT
    enterprises to a trusted cloud environment in order to reduce
    costs, expand IT service delivery and increase security and
    compliance. Trends and developments in the broadcast and new
    media solutions market include the continuing worldwide
    transition to digital and HD technologies; a rebound in the
    global ad spending market; increasing demand for new systems to
    deliver rich media content to live sports and entertainment
    venues, retail establishments and mobile handheld



devices; and a transition from the traditional linear broadcast
    TV advertising model to

out-of-home

networks. In the energy market, we believe oil exploration must
    accelerate to meet rising global demand for oil and that drivers
    of industry demand, including commodity prices, drilling rig
    counts and well completions and workover activity, should remain
    favorable in most geographic market areas, with the exception of
    the Gulf of Mexico. In the healthcare market, we believe there
    are significant opportunities for growth as we capitalize on
    trends towards accelerating electronic health record adoption
    and sharing; accountable care driving hospital consolidation and
    enterprise solutions; and increased penalties for healthcare
    data security violations fueling cyber solutions.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
    well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
    the market trends noted above in this Report. While we believe
    that some of these developments may temper near-term growth, we
    also expect they generally will have a longer-term positive
    impact on us. However, we remain subject to general economic
    conditions that could adversely affect us and our suppliers and
    customers. We also remain subject to other risks associated with
    these markets, including technological uncertainties, adoption
    of our new products and other risks which are discussed below
    under “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May
    Affect Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

The increase in revenue in fiscal 2011
    compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to revenue from
    CapRock, which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2011,
    and strength in international sales in Tactical Communications
    in our RF Communications segment. The increase in income from
    continuing operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010
    was primarily due to higher operating income in our RF
    Communications segment resulting from higher international sales
    in Tactical Communications, partially offset by lower operating
    income in our Integrated Network Solutions segment, primarily
    due to integration and other costs associated with our
    acquisitions of CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, and higher
    interest expense, primarily due to borrowings associated with
    these acquisitions. The decrease in income from continuing
    operations as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared
    with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to lower operating income as
    a percentage of revenue in our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment, primarily the result of integration and other costs
    associated with the acquisitions mentioned above. See the
    “Interest Income and Interest Expense” and
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussions below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Revenue increased in fiscal 2010
    compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to increases in revenue
    in our RF Communications and Integrated Network Solutions
    segments, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our
    Government Communications Systems segment. Fiscal 2010 revenue
    increased by 17.4 percent and 0.6 percent,
    respectively, in our RF Communications and Integrated Network
    Solutions segments, and decreased 6.3 percent in our
    Government Communications Systems segment. Our RF Communications
    segment revenue benefited from our acquisition of Wireless
    Systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, partially offset
    by a decline in our Tactical Communications business in fiscal
    2010. Government Communications Systems segment revenue
    reflected the winding down of the Field Data Collection
    Automation (“FDCA”) program for the 2010
    U.S. Census that was mostly offset by growth from several
    new programs and growth initiatives. Fiscal 2010 income from
    continuing operations increased from fiscal 2009, primarily due
    to a $255.5 million ($196.7 million after-tax)
    non-cash charge recorded in fiscal 2009 for impairment of
    goodwill and other long-lived assets in our Integrated Network
    Solutions segment related to Broadcast and New Media Solutions
    and strong operating results in fiscal 2010 in our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments.
    Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2009 included an
    $18.0 million charge for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs; interest expense
    increased to $72.1 million in fiscal 2010 from interest
    expense of $52.8 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to
    increased borrowings related to our acquisition of Wireless
    Systems; and in fiscal 2010, our effective tax rate (income
    taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations
    before income taxes) was 33.2 percent compared with an
    effective tax rate of 35.6 percent in



fiscal 2009. See the “Interest Income and Interest
    Expense,” “Income Taxes” and “Discussion of
    Business Segments” discussions below in this MD&A for

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

The decrease in gross margin (revenue
    less cost of product sales and services) as a percentage of
    revenue (“gross margin percentage”) in fiscal 2011
    compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a less favorable
    product mix in our RF Communications segment due to lower sales
    of radios to equip the U.S. military’s MRAP vehicles
    in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and the impact of our
    acquisition of CapRock, which has a lower gross margin
    percentage than our overall gross margin percentage. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

The increase in gross margin percentage
    in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an
    increase in the gross margin percentage in our RF Communications
    segment as a result of favorable product mix, due to the MRAP
    vehicle and mine resistant ambush protected all-terrain vehicle
    (“M-ATV”) programs, and operational efficiencies, as
    well as a higher percentage of our overall sales that was
    generated by this higher-margin segment. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

Engineering, selling and administrative
    (“ESA”) expenses, and ESA expenses as a percentage of
    revenue, increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010
    primarily due to our acquisitions of CapRock, Schlumberger GCS
    and Carefx, including integration and other costs associated
    with these acquisitions, and the pursuit of new growth
    opportunities. See the “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussion below in this MD&A for further
    information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in ESA expenses, were
    $335.6 million in fiscal 2011 compared with
    $325.8 million in fiscal 2010.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

ESA expenses increased in 2010 compared
    with fiscal 2009 primarily due to our acquisition of Wireless
    Systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Additionally, ESA
    expenses in fiscal 2010 included $20.4 million of
    acquisition-related costs, compared with $8.9 million of
    acquisition-related costs incurred in fiscal 2009. These
    increases in ESA expenses were partially offset by the benefit
    of cost-reduction actions taken in fiscal 2009.

As a percentage of revenue, ESA expenses increased in fiscal
    2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to our acquisition
    of Wireless Systems, which has higher ESA expenses as a
    percentage of revenue compared with our other businesses. See
    the “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below
    in this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in ESA expenses, were
    $325.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared with
    $243.5 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in
    company-sponsored research and product development costs was
    primarily due to our acquisition of Wireless Systems.

In fiscal 2011, the major discrete item
    from which our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage
    of income from continuing operations before income taxes)
    benefited was a $5.9 million tax benefit associated with
    legislative action during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 that
    restored the U.S. Federal income tax credit for research
    and development expenses. In fiscal 2010, the major discrete
    item from which our effective tax rate benefited was a
    $3.5 million state income tax benefit associated with the
    filing of our income tax returns. See

Note 23: Income
    Taxes

in the Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

In fiscal 2010, the major discrete item
    from which our effective tax rate benefited was the
    $3.5 million state income tax benefit noted above regarding
    fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, our
    effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory
    income tax rate. The major discrete items in fiscal 2009 were
    the non-deductibility of a significant portion of the
    $255.5 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill
    and other long-lived assets in our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment related to Broadcast and New Media Solutions recorded in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, largely offset by: a
    $3.3 million tax benefit that we recorded in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009 when legislative action restored the
    U.S. Federal income tax credit for research and development
    expenses for fiscal 2008; a $3.7 million state tax benefit
    in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the filing of
    our tax returns; and a $6.5 million favorable impact
    recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 from the settlement
    of the U.S. Federal income tax audit of fiscal year 2007.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

Revenue in fiscal 2011 included
    $1,775.4 million in Tactical Communications and
    $513.8 million in Public Safety and Professional
    Communications. Revenue growth and higher operating income in
    fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 were primarily due to
    strong international sales in Tactical Communications and
    continuing Falcon
    III

®

adoption to support the DoD’s vision for wideband
    networking throughout the battlefield, partially offset by lower
    revenue from shipments of radios to equip MRAP vehicles.

The increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue in
    fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to
    higher operating margins on international sales in Tactical
    Communications and a $19.3 million charge incurred in
    fiscal 2010 associated with our acquisition of Wireless Systems
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, partially offset by the
    decrease in high-margin sales of radios to equip MRAP vehicles.

Our new manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York is up and
    running. The new facility consolidates multiple facilities into
    one location, reducing production cycle times and creating
    operational efficiencies. We now have a single facility of
    sufficient size, layout and capabilities to fully implement the
    lean production processes we need to further reduce product
    costs. The new facility is expected to provide cost savings and
    create a

state-of-the-art

high-volume manufacturing capability for products across RF
    Communications.

Orders for this segment were $2.03 billion for fiscal 2011
    compared with $2.88 billion for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011
    orders included $1.30 billion in Tactical Communications
    and $730 million in Public Safety and Professional
    Communications. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011,
    total backlog in our RF Communications segment was
    $1.50 billion, including $766 million in Tactical
    Communications and $737 million in Public Safety and
    Professional Communications.

In both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, this segment derived
    63 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the
    U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
    contractors.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Revenue in fiscal 2010 included
    $1,573.2 million in Tactical Communications and
    $494.0 million in Public Safety and Professional
    Communications. Revenue growth in fiscal 2010 compared with
    fiscal 2009 was driven by our acquisition of Wireless Systems in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a decline
    in total tactical radio sales.

In spite of the decline in the total tactical radio market, our
    tactical radio sales increased in the U.S. market due to
    customer adoption of our next-generation Falcon III radios,
    as well as equipping a significant number of the
    U.S. military’s MRAP vehicles and M-ATVs with Falcon
    II

®

and Falcon III radios. In the international market, our
    tactical radio sales declined in fiscal 2010 compared with
    fiscal 2009 primarily due to a delay in shipments as a result of
    the high priority of the U.S. military’s MRAP vehicle
    and M-ATV programs. However, international orders in fiscal 2010
    were strong, signaling growing international demand.

The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher
    operating margins in Tactical Communications and our acquisition
    of Wireless Systems. Additionally, we incurred a
    $19.3 million charge associated with our acquisition of
    Wireless Systems in fiscal 2010 compared with $9.5 million
    in fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income as a percentage
    of revenue was primarily driven by favorable product mix as a
    result of the U.S. military’s MRAP vehicle and M-ATV
    programs, cost-reduction actions implemented in the second half
    of fiscal 2009 and operational efficiencies.

Orders for this segment were $2.88 billion for fiscal 2010
    compared with $1.25 billion for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010
    orders included $2.34 billion in Tactical Communications
    and $541 million in Public Safety and Professional
    Communications. At the end of the fourth quarter, total backlog
    in our RF Communications segment was $1.76 billion,
    including $1.24 billion in Tactical Communications and
    $527 million in Public Safety and Professional
    Communications.

In both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, this segment derived
    63 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the
    U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
    contractors.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

The increase in revenue in fiscal 2011
    compared with 2010 was primarily due to revenue from CapRock,
    which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and
    Schlumberger GCS, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2011, and strong growth at Broadcast and New Media
    Solutions. Integrated Network Solutions operating income and
    operating income as a percentage of revenue were lower in fiscal
    2011 compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the impact of
    $46.6 million in charges for integration and other costs
    associated with our acquisitions of CapRock, Schlumberger GCS,
    the Core180 Infrastructure and Carefx, accelerated investments
    in Cyber Integrated Solutions and lower pricing on the IT
    Services contract extension for the NMCI program, partially
    offset by much improved performance in Broadcast and New Media
    Solutions. For Cyber Integrated Solutions, due to experiencing a
    much longer selling cycle than we previously had expected and
    the associated impact to revenue and income, we expect an
    operating loss of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2012.

On July 30, 2010, we acquired privately held CapRock, a
    global provider of mission-critical, managed satellite
    communications services for the government, energy and maritime
    industries. CapRock’s solutions include broadband Internet
    access, VOIP telephony, wideband networking and real-time video,
    delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around the world. The
    acquisition of CapRock increased the breadth of our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The total net purchase
    price for CapRock was $517.5 million. Our fiscal 2011
    results of operations included eleven months of operating
    results associated with CapRock, representing the period
    subsequent to the acquisition.

On April 4, 2011, we acquired Schlumberger GCS, a provider
    of satellite and terrestrial communications services for the
    worldwide energy industry. The total net purchase price for
    Schlumberger GCS was $380.6 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. Our fiscal 2011 results of operations
    included three months of operating results associated with
    Schlumberger GCS, representing the period subsequent to the
    acquisition.

On April 4, 2011, we acquired privately held Carefx, a
    provider of interoperability workflow solutions for government
    and commercial healthcare providers. Carefx’s solution
    suite is used by more than 800 hospitals, healthcare systems and
    health information exchanges across North America, Europe and
    Asia. This acquisition expanded our presence in government
    healthcare, provided entry into the commercial healthcare
    market, and is expected to leverage the healthcare
    interoperability workflow products offered by Carefx and the
    broader scale of enterprise intelligence solutions and services
    that we provide. The total net purchase price for Carefx was
    $152.6 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Our
    fiscal 2011 results of operations included three months of
    operating results associated with Carefx, representing the
    period subsequent to the acquisition.

For further information related to the acquisitions described
    above, including the allocation of the purchase price and pro
    forma results as if the CapRock and Schlumberger GCS
    acquisitions had taken place as of the beginning of the periods
    presented, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the
    Notes.

Orders for this segment were $2.00 billion for fiscal 2011
    compared with $1.51 billion for fiscal 2010. During fiscal
    2011, we were not awarded the recompete for the Patriot program
    which will result in lower revenue from this program in fiscal
    2012 compared with fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010,
    this segment derived 55 percent and 64 percent,
    respectively, of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the
    U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
    contractors.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

The increase in revenue in fiscal 2010
    compared with 2009 was primarily driven by higher Healthcare
    Solutions revenue, which benefited from our acquisition of
    Patriot in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 (as discussed in
    the next paragraph below), and higher IT Services revenue,
    driven by increased revenue on the IT services relocation
    program for the USSOUTHCOM and the U.S. Air Force



NETCENTS program. This revenue growth was mostly offset by a
    decline in Broadcast and New Media Solutions revenue, primarily
    due to continued lower U.S. broadcaster capital spending as
    well as the completion of the transition from analog to digital
    transmission in the U.S. The operating loss in fiscal 2009
    was due to a $255.5 million non-cash charge for impairment
    of goodwill and other long-lived assets in Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions, and included $13.1 million in charges
    related to cost-reduction actions, also in Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions. Operating income in fiscal 2010 included
    $10 million in charges related to cost-reduction actions
    and $6 million in inventory write-downs associated with
    weaker product demand in Broadcast and New Media Solutions as a
    result of continuing weakness in the U.S. broadcast market.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired Patriot, which
    had about 100 employees and expanded our position as a
    leading provider of integrated and interoperable healthcare IT
    solutions for the U.S. Government market. Additionally, we
    believed this acquisition further positioned us for providing a
    comprehensive solution addressing the national priority of
    integrating the VA and Military Health Systems.

Orders for this segment were $1.51 billion for fiscal 2010
    compared with $1.42 billion for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010
    and fiscal 2009, this segment derived 64 percent and
    57 percent, respectively, of its revenue from
    U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

Revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with
    fiscal 2010 increased on the GOES-R Ground and Antenna Segment
    weather programs for NOAA, HNRs for the U.S. Army and our
    space communications programs (including satellite reflector
    programs for commercial customers), but declined on several
    classified programs as a result of slower U.S. Government
    spending. Revenue also declined, as expected, on the FDCA
    program for the 2010 U.S. Census due to its wind-down.
    Important ongoing programs for this segment include FTI, GOES-R,
    F-35, MET, WIN-T and various classified space communications
    systems programs.

Operating income and income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal
    2011 were essentially flat compared with fiscal 2010. This was
    primarily due to improved performance on our space
    communications systems programs (including satellite reflector
    programs for commercial customers), the GOES-R Ground and
    Antenna Segment weather programs and HNR sales to the
    U.S. Army, partially offset by the impact of the wind-down
    on the FDCA program for the 2010 U.S. Census and lower
    operating income on several classified programs.

Orders for this segment were $1.69 billion for fiscal 2011
    and $1.78 billion for fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011 and
    fiscal 2010, this segment derived 97 percent and
    94 percent, respectively, of its revenue from
    U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with
    fiscal 2009 declined as the FDCA program for the
    U.S. Census Bureau for the 2010 U.S. Census neared
    completion. The $238 million decline in revenue from the
    FDCA program in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increased
    revenue in fiscal 2010 from the GOES-R Ground Segment weather
    program for NOAA, the MET program for the U.S. Army, the
    FTI program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the WIN-T
    program.

The increases in operating income and operating income as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009
    were primarily due to excellent award fees and overall program
    execution across the segment. Additionally, operating income in
    fiscal 2009 included an $18.0 million charge for schedule
    and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector programs.

Orders for this segment were $1.78 billion for fiscal 2010
    and $1.88 billion for fiscal 2009. In both fiscal 2010 and
    fiscal 2009, this segment derived 94 percent of its revenue
    from U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors.

Fiscal 2011 Compared With Fiscal
    2010:

Unallocated corporate expense decreased
    in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to a
    charge associated with a contract termination, recorded in
    fiscal 2010, and lower benefit plan expenses. Corporate
    eliminations increased in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010,
    primarily due to higher intersegment activity between the
    Government Communications Systems and Integrated Network
    Solutions segments.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Unallocated corporate expense increased
    in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to
    investments made in pursuit of new growth opportunities,
    increased charitable contributions and a charge associated with
    a contract termination.

Discontinued
    Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the

    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated our former HSTX
    operating segment. Our historical financial results have been
    restated to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all

Cash and cash equivalents:

Our
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes the results of
    HSTX through the May 27, 2009 Spin-off date. Accordingly,
    for fiscal 2009, our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and
    the following analysis, includes approximately eleven months of
    cash flows from HSTX.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2010 to
    fiscal 2011 was primarily due to $1,082.6 million of cash
    paid for acquired businesses, $324.9 million of additions
    of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software,
    $256.1 million used to repurchase shares of our common
    stock, and $127.0 million used to pay cash dividends,
    partially offset by $833.1 million of net cash provided by
    operating activities and $851.4 million of net proceeds
    from borrowings.

Our financial position remained strong at July 1, 2011. We
    ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of
    $366.9 million; we have no long-term debt maturing until
    fiscal 2016; we have a senior unsecured $750 million
    revolving credit facility that expires in September 2013
    ($570 million of which was available to us as of
    July 1, 2011 as a result of $180 million of short-term
    debt outstanding under our commercial paper program, that was
    supported by such senior unsecured revolving credit facility);
    we have a senior unsecured $300 million

364-day

revolving credit facility that expires on September 28,
    2011 (all of which was available to us as of July 1, 2011);
    and we do not have any material defined benefit pension plan
    obligations.

Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated
    from operations, credit ratings, available credit facilities,
    cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date,
    and do not expect to experience, any



material issues with liquidity, although we can give no
    assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in
    light of the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.

We also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated
    from operations, our credit facilities and access to the public
    and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to
    provide for our anticipated working capital requirements,
    capital expenditures and share repurchases under our New
    Repurchase Program for the next 12 months. We anticipate
    tax payments over the next three years to be approximately equal
    to our tax expense during the same period. We anticipate that
    our fiscal 2012 cash outlays may include strategic acquisitions.
    Other than those cash outlays noted in the “Contractual
    Obligations” discussion below in this MD&A, capital
    expenditures, potential acquisitions and share repurchases under
    our New Repurchase Program, no other significant cash outlays
    are anticipated in fiscal 2012.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
    continue to generate cash flow at current levels, that ongoing
    operational improvements will be achieved, or that the cost or
    availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial
    paper program or our credit facilities or in the debt markets
    will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital
    markets disruptions. If we are unable to maintain cash balances
    or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our
    obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital
    expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce
    or terminate our New Repurchase Program, reduce or eliminate
    dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or
    obtain additional financing. Our ability to make principal
    payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness
    depends on our future performance and financial results, which,
    to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
    affecting the defense, government and integrated communications
    and information technology and services markets and to general
    economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and
    regulatory factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    operating activities was $833.1 million in fiscal 2011
    compared with $802.7 million in fiscal 2010. All of our
    segments had positive cash flow from operating activities in
    fiscal 2011, reflecting strong operating income, with a
    significant contribution received from our RF Communications
    segment.

Net cash used in investing
    activities:

Our net cash used in investing
    activities was $1,417.5 million in fiscal 2011 compared
    with $250.1 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash used in
    investing activities in fiscal 2011 was due to
    $1,082.6 million of cash paid for acquired businesses,
    $311.3 million of property, plant and equipment additions,
    $13.6 million of capitalized software additions and
    $10.0 million of cash paid for a cost-method investment.
    Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 was due to
    $189.9 million of property, plant and equipment additions,
    $52.1 million of cash paid for acquired businesses and
    $8.1 million of capitalized software additions. The
    increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared with
    fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the build-out of our Cyber
    Integration Center and our new RF Communications manufacturing
    facility. Our total capital expenditures, including capitalized
    software, in fiscal 2012 are expected to be between
    $265 million and $285 million.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    financing activities was $492.8 million in fiscal 2011
    compared with net cash used in financing activities of
    $380.9 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash provided by
    financing activities in fiscal 2011 was due to
    $851.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings and
    $24.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee
    stock options, partially offset by $256.1 million used to
    repurchase shares of our common stock and $127.0 million
    used to pay cash dividends. Net cash used in financing
    activities in fiscal 2010 was due to $208.0 million used to
    repurchase shares of our common stock, $115.0 million used
    to pay cash dividends and $76.8 million used for repayment
    of borrowings, partially offset by $18.9 million of
    proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2011, we used $250.0 million to repurchase
    5,325,690 shares of our common stock under our repurchase
    program at an average price per share of $46.94, including
    commissions. During fiscal 2010, we used $199.9 million to
    repurchase 4,779,411 shares of our common stock under our
    repurchase program at an average price per share of $41.83,
    including commissions. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010,
    $6.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in shares
    of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to
    satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. In
    fiscal 2010, we used $1.4 million to repurchase
    29,760 shares of our common stock from our Rabbi Trust.
    Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.

On July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the
    $1 billion New Repurchase Program. The New Repurchase
    Program replaced our previous share repurchase authorization
    under the 2009 Repurchase Program, which had a remaining, unused
    authorization of approximately $200 million at July 1,
    2011. The New Repurchase Program does not have a stated
    expiration date. We currently expect to repurchase up to
    $500 million in shares



under the New Repurchase Program by the end of the calendar year
    2011. The New Repurchase Program is expected to result in
    repurchases well in excess of the dilutive effect of shares
    issued under our share-based incentive plans. However, the level
    of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our
    financial condition, capital requirements, results of
    operations, future business prospects and other factors that our
    Board of Directors may deem relevant. Share repurchases are
    expected to be funded with available cash and commercial paper.
    Repurchases under the New Repurchase Program may be made through
    open market purchases, private transactions, transactions
    structured through investment banking institutions or any
    combination thereof. The timing, volume and nature of share
    repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable
    securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and
    may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Additional
    information regarding share repurchases during fiscal 2011 and
    our Repurchase Programs is set forth above under
    “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities” of this Report.

Dividends

On July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.25 per
    share to $.28 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $1.12 per share, which was our tenth consecutive annual increase
    in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash
    dividend rate was $1.00 per share, $.88 per share and $.80 per
    share in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There can be
    no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will
    continue to increase. Quarterly cash dividends are typically
    paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect
    that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future,
    but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future
    dividends. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant. Additional information concerning our
    dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Capital
    Structure and Resources

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement:

As discussed in

Note 11: Credit Arrangements

in the Notes, on
    September 29, 2010, we entered into a $300 million
    senior unsecured

364-day

revolving credit agreement (“the

“364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders.
    The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit
    to us in the form of revolving loans at any time and from time
    to time during the term of the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at
    any time outstanding not to exceed $300 million. Borrowings
    under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement will be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars. The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and
    other general corporate purposes (excluding hostile
    acquisitions) and may also be used to support any commercial
    paper that we may issue.

At our election, borrowings under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest either at LIBOR
    plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable
    margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set at
    1.75 percent, may increase (to a maximum amount of
    2.25 percent) or decrease (to a minimum amount of
    1.25 percent) based on changes in ratings for our senior
    unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”). The base rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the
    highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus
    0.50 percent, (ii) SunTrust Bank’s publicly
    announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars or
    (iii) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus
    1.00 percent. The interest rate margin over the base rate,
    initially set at 0.75 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.25 percent) or decrease (to a minimum amount of
    0.25 percent) based on our Senior Debt Ratings.

The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants
    similar to the 2008 Credit Agreement discussed below and
    described in more detail in

Note: 11 Credit Arrangements

in the Notes. We were in compliance with the covenants in the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement in fiscal 2011. The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain events of default
    similar to the 2008 Credit Agreement discussed below. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 28, 2011, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 1, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement.

2008 Credit Agreement:

On
    September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any



time and from time to time during the term of the 2008 Credit
    Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
    outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both revolving
    loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be
    guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We also may designate certain
    subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain
    of the covenants and representations in the 2008 Credit
    Agreement do not apply to such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on our Senior Debt Ratings and on the
    degree of utilization under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    (“Utilization”). The base rate is a fluctuating rate
    equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus
    0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced
    prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest rate
    margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then
    the interest rate margin over the base rate will increase to
    either 0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on
    Utilization. Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear
    interest at LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over
    LIBOR described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined
    based on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants,
    including covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets;
    certain mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale
    and leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing
    investments; and certain investments in unrestricted
    subsidiaries. The 2008 Credit Agreement also requires that we
    not permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total
    capital, each as defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and
    not permit our ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net
    interest expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00
    (measured on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the 2008 Credit Agreement in fiscal 2011. The 2008
    Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including:
    failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms,
    covenants and agreements; material inaccuracy of any
    representation or warranty; payment default under other
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million, other default under such other indebtedness
    that permits acceleration of such indebtedness, or acceleration
    of such other indebtedness; occurrence of one or more final
    judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $75 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liability in excess of $75 million; any bankruptcy or
    insolvency; or a change of control, including if a person or
    group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of
    our voting stock. If an event of default occurs the lenders may,
    among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all
    outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable
    together with accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or
    outstanding under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature
    on September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are
    terminated earlier either at our request or if certain events of
    default occur. At July 1, 2011, we had no borrowings
    outstanding under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had
    $180.0 million of short-term debt outstanding under our
    commercial paper program that was supported by our senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility under the 2008 Credit
    Agreement.

Long-Term Debt:

As discussed in

Note 13: Long-Term Debt

in the Notes, on
    December 3, 2010, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    4.4% Notes due December 15, 2020 (the “2020
    Notes”) and $300 million in aggregate principal amount
    of 6.15% Notes due December 15, 2040 (the “2040
    Notes”). Interest on each of the 2020 Notes and the 2040
    Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and
    December 15 of each year. We may redeem the 2020 Notes

and/or

the
    2040 Notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part
    at the applicable “make-whole” redemption price. The
    applicable “make-whole” redemption price is equal to
    the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the
    notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis



(assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 25 basis
    points in the case of the 2020 Notes and 35 basis points in
    the case of the 2040 Notes. In each case, we will pay accrued
    interest on the principal amount of the notes being redeemed to
    the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of control
    combined with a below-investment-grade rating event, we may be
    required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price
    equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of
    the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes
    repurchased to the date of repurchase. We incurred
    $5.5 million and $4.8 million in debt issuance costs
    and discounts related to the issuance of the 2020 Notes and 2040
    Notes, respectively, which are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the respective lives of the notes,
    which approximates the effective interest rate method, and are
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the
    notes, we entered into treasury lock agreements to protect
    against fluctuations in forecasted interest payments resulting
    from the issuance of ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in
    the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. These agreements were
    determined to be highly effective in offsetting changes in
    forecasted interest payments as a result of changes in the
    benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these
    agreements on December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of
    $5.5 million, net of income tax, in shareholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    This loss, along with $5.0 million in debt issuance costs,
    is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
    notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method,
    and is reflected as a portion of interest expense in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in



aggregate principal amount of the debentures. On
    February 1, 2008, we redeemed $99.2 million in
    aggregate principal amount of the debentures pursuant to the
    procedures for redemption at the option of the holders of the
    debentures. We may redeem the remaining $25.8 million in
    aggregate principal amount of the debentures in whole, or in
    part, at any time at a pre-determined redemption price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

Short-Term Debt:

Our short-term debt at
    July 1, 2011, April 1, 2011, December 31, 2010,
    October 1, 2010 and July 2, 2010 was
    $180.0 million, $180.0 million, $30.0 million,
    $275.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and
    consisted primarily of commercial paper outstanding under our
    commercial paper program that was supported by our senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility under the 2008 Credit
    Agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued
    approximately $320 million of commercial paper to fund a
    portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of CapRock.
    During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we used approximately
    $285 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2020
    Notes and 2040 Notes for repayment of a substantial portion of
    our outstanding commercial paper. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2011, we issued $150 million of commercial paper to
    fund a portion of the purchase price for our pending
    acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, both of which we
    completed on April 4, 2011, the first business day of the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.

Other:

We have an automatically
    effective, universal shelf registration statement, filed with
    the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to the potential future
    issuance of an indeterminate amount of securities, including
    debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, fractional
    interests in preferred stock represented by depositary shares
    and warrants to purchase debt securities, preferred stock or
    common stock.

We expect to maintain operating ratios, fixed-charge coverage
    ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient for retention of, or
    improvement to, our current debt ratings. There are no
    assurances that our debt ratings will not be reduced in the
    future. If our debt ratings are lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may not be able to issue short-term
    commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow under our
    credit facilities or pursue other options. In addition, if our
    debt ratings are lowered below “investment grade,”
    then we may also be required to provide cash collateral to
    support outstanding performance bonds. For a discussion of such
    performance bonds, see the “Commercial Commitments”
    discussion below. We do not currently foresee losing our
    investment-grade debt ratings, but no assurances can be given.
    If our debt ratings were downgraded, however, it could adversely
    impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and
    access to capital markets and our ability to receive certain
    types of contract awards.

Contractual
    Obligations

At July 1, 2011, we had contractual cash obligations to
    repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments
    under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term
    obligations are as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
    following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
    not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
    as defined above. As of July 1, 2011, we did not have
    material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
    that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, we
    are not currently a party to any related party transactions that
    materially affect our results of operations, financial condition
    or cash flows.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
    and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
    provide representations, warranties

and/or

indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such
    as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot
    estimate the potential liability from such representations,
    warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown
    conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities
    relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities
    will have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
    acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
    properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
    the event any of these third parties vacates any of these
    premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
    arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
    such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not
    material to our results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Commercial
    Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. At July 1, 2011, we had commercial
    commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of
    credit and other arrangements, as follows:

The standby letters of credit and surety bonds used for
    performance are primarily related to Public Safety and
    Professional Communications, and the total commitments in the
    table above have increased from commitments outstanding as of
    the end of fiscal 2010, primarily due to growth in Public Safety
    and Professional Communications



during fiscal 2011. As is customary in bidding for and
    completing network infrastructure projects for public safety
    systems, contractors are required to procure performance/bid
    bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds (collectively,
    “Performance Bonds”). Such Performance Bonds normally
    have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the
    industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek
    redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance
    requirements under a contract. A customer is permitted to draw
    on a Performance Bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a
    project contract. In such an event, we would be obligated to
    reimburse the financial institution that issued the Performance
    Bond for the amounts paid. It has been rare for our Public
    Safety and Professional Communications business and its
    predecessors to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. In addition,
    pursuant to the terms under which we procure Performance Bonds,
    if our credit ratings are lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may be required to provide collateral to
    support a portion of the outstanding amount of Performance
    Bonds. Such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance
    of Performance Bonds and could make it more difficult to procure
    Performance Bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to
    compete for contract awards. Such collateral requirements could
    also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or
    corporate purposes.

Financial
    Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use
    foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both
    balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our
    hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
    estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
    availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent change in
    currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives
    held at July 1, 2011 would not have had a material impact
    on the fair value of such instruments. This quantification of
    exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange
    financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting
    impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated
    assets, liabilities and firm commitments. See

Note 19:
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

in the Notes
    for additional information.

Interest Rates:

As of July 1,
    2011, we had long-term debt obligations and short-term debt
    under our commercial paper program subject to interest rate
    risk. Because the interest rates on our long-term debt
    obligations are fixed, and because our long-term debt is not
    putable (redeemable at the option of the holders of the debt
    prior to maturity), the interest rate risk associated with this
    debt on our results of operations is not material. We have a
    short-term variable-rate commercial paper program in place,
    which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. We
    can give no assurances that interest rates will not change
    significantly or have a material effect on our income or cash
    flows in fiscal 2012.

Impact of
    Foreign Exchange

Approximately 33 percent of our international business was
    transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2011
    compared with 41 percent in fiscal 2010. The impact of
    translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
    U.S. dollars is included as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. As of July 1, 2011, the
    cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders’
    equity was a $50.8 million gain compared with a
    $14.3 million gain at July 2, 2010. We utilize foreign
    currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of
    international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our
    results in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Impact of
    Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
    practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
    inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
    cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing
    prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin,
    revenue or operating income in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
    of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
    accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
    our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
    transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
    estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies
    and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of
    our financial statements because their application places the
    most significant



demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results
    dependent upon estimates about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
    Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are
    described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any
    associated risks related to these estimates on our business
    operations are discussed throughout this MD&A where such
    estimates affect our reported and expected financial results.
    Senior management has discussed the development and selection of
    the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related
    disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee of our Board
    of Directors. Preparation of this Report requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
    assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
    estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
    preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
    estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
    based on experience and other information available prior to the
    issuance of the financial statements. Materially different
    results can occur as circumstances change and additional
    information becomes known, including for estimates that we do
    not deem “critical.”

Revenue
    Recognition on Development and Production Contracts and Contract
    Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
    development and production contracts. Revenue related to
    development and production contracts is recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
    to date against estimated total contract costs at completion

(“cost-to-cost”)

with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
    profit. Revenue in our Government Communications Systems segment
    primarily relates to development and production contracts and
    the

percentage-of-completion

method of revenue recognition is primarily used for these
    contracts. Amounts representing development and production
    contract change orders, claims or other items that may change
    the scope of a development and production contract are included
    in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and
    realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award fees
    applicable to performance on development and production
    contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates,
    and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
    anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions, which
    increase earnings based solely on a single significant event,
    are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Our
    development and production contracts are generally not
    segmented. If development and production contracts are
    segmented, we have determined that they meet the segmenting
    criteria outlined in the accounting standard for
    construction-type and production-type contracts.

Under the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
    used to recognize profit for each development and production
    contract over its entire period of performance. Recognition of
    profit on development and production fixed-price contracts
    requires estimates of: the contract value or total contract
    revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of
    progress toward completion. The estimated profit or loss on a
    development and production contract is equal to the difference
    between the estimated contract value and the estimated total
    cost at completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our
    programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion
    often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be
    considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor
    productivity and availability of labor, the nature and
    complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost of
    materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of delayed
    performance, availability and timing of funding from the
    customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
    development and production contract included in the estimate to
    complete. We review cost performance and estimates to complete
    on our ongoing development and production contracts at least
    quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a change in
    estimated cost to complete a development and production contract
    is determined to have an impact on contract earnings, we will
    record a positive or negative adjustment to estimated earnings
    when identified. Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable
    development and production contract are recognized when
    allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal to the allowable
    costs plus the profit on those costs. These profits may be at a
    fixed or variable percentage of allowable costs, depending on
    the contract fee arrangement. Thus, cost-reimbursable
    development and production contracts generally are not subject
    to the same estimation risks that affect fixed-price development
    and production contracts. We have not made any material changes
    in the methodologies used to recognize revenue on development
    and production contracts or to estimate our costs related to
    development and production contracts in the past three fiscal
    years.

As of July 1, 2011, the amount of unbilled costs and
    accrued earnings on fixed-price development and production
    contracts classified as “Inventory” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet was $381.0 million compared with
    $295.3 million as of July 2, 2010. These amounts
    include gross costs and accrued income, which is netted against
    billings and progress payments. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more programs could have a material



effect on our statement of financial position and results of
    operations. For example, a one percent variance in our estimate
    of accrued income booked as of July 1, 2011 on all open
    fixed-price development and production contracts would impact
    our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
    services by $17.5 million.

Provisions
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
    balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
    competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
    obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
    requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
    and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
    primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand,
    anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
    review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our
    business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and
    use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product
    line, technological change and new product development. These
    factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
    inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
    future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
    we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
    excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
    that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
    recognize such costs in the “Cost of product sales”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of
    such determination. In the case of goods which have been written
    down below cost, such reduced amount is to be considered the
    cost for subsequent accounting purposes. We have not made any
    material changes in the reserve methodology used to establish
    our inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.

As of July 1, 2011, our reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory was $84.8 million, or 20.0 percent of our
    gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of
    $85.9 million, or 21.2 percent of our gross inventory
    balance, as of July 2, 2010. We recorded
    $38.8 million, $20.8 million and $8.6 million in
    inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess
    and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations
    before income taxes during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure
    the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand,
    including the impact of planned future product launches, any
    significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and our reported operating results.

Goodwill

Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1,
    2011 and July 2, 2010 was $2,381.4 million and
    $1,576.2 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized.
    We perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more
    frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. We test goodwill for
    impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to
    identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of
    each of our reporting units with its net book value, including
    goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and
    liabilities as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting
    unit exceeds its adjusted net book value, goodwill of the
    reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
    the impairment test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
    the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
    business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
    allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
    including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
    to acquire the reporting unit.

We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on
    projected cash flows, and sales

and/or

earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months’
    sales and earnings of our reporting units. Projected cash flows
    are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs
    and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial
    and market conditions of the underlying business; and the
    resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate
    discount rate which reflects the risk in the forecasted cash
    flows. The sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and
    earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples
    of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales
    and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar
    businesses made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any
    implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value
    based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair
    value determined by using all of the above-described models, is
    reasonable. We have not made any material changes during the
    past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the
    assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.



Fiscal
    2009 Impairment Tests

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our fiscal
    2009 annual impairment tests of our reporting units’
    goodwill. Because of the global recession and postponement of
    capital projects, which significantly weakened demand, and the
    general decline of peer company valuations impacting our
    valuation, we determined that goodwill in our Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions reporting unit (formerly a separate reportable
    segment and which, effective for the third quarter of fiscal
    2011, is reported under our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment) was impaired. As a result, we recorded a
    $160.9 million non-cash charge for the impairment of
    goodwill. See

Note 8: Goodwill

and

Note 22:
    Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for
    additional information regarding goodwill, including impairment
    of Broadcast and New Media Solutions’ goodwill. In fiscal
    2009, we also determined that goodwill in our former HSTX
    segment was impaired. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

for additional information regarding impairment
    of HSTX’s goodwill.

Fiscal
    2010 and 2011 Impairment Tests

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2011, we performed our
    annual impairment tests of our reporting units’ goodwill.
    We completed these tests with no adjustment required to the
    goodwill of any of our reporting units.

For all of our reporting units except for Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions, the fair value determination resulted in an
    amount that exceeded the reporting unit’s adjusted net book
    value by a substantial margin.

For our Broadcast and New Media Solutions reporting unit, the
    fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the
    adjusted net book value of this reporting unit by approximately
    12 percent in 2011 and 8 percent in 2010. Goodwill
    allocated to this reporting unit as of July 1, 2011 and
    July 2, 2010 was $673.8 million and
    $661.2 million, respectively. When comparing the results
    from the fair value determination of this reporting unit in
    fiscal 2011 with the results from fiscal 2010, an increase in
    the fair value based on sales multiples paid for recent
    acquisitions of similar businesses and current sales multiples
    of similar businesses was partially offset by a slight decrease
    in fair value based on projected cash flows.

Key assumptions used in projecting cash flows included estimates
    of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics based
    on our intermediate and long-term views of the financial and
    market conditions of the underlying business. These assumptions
    assume a continuation of the rebound in capital spending by our
    customers based on continuing global economic growth; successful
    implementation of several strategic growth initiatives,
    including redeployment of resources into new media and
    international markets, where we believe there are significant
    new business opportunities; and favorable impacts from
    cost-reduction actions taken in the current and prior fiscal
    years. Events that could have a detrimental impact to the fair
    value of this reporting unit in the future include less than
    forecasted global economic growth, less than forecasted demand
    for our products (for example, a slower or less widely than
    anticipated migration from analog to digital broadcasting in
    international markets), and poor execution of our growth
    strategies. Additionally, slower global economic growth could
    negatively impact fair value based on sales multiples of similar
    business and sales multiples paid for acquisitions of similar
    businesses.

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
    specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
    regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
    balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
    required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
    depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
    appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
    gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
    under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
    for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
    future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
    existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We
    have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three
    fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1, 2011 included
    a current deferred tax asset of $171.0 million and a
    non-current deferred tax asset of $5.7 million. This
    compares with a current deferred tax asset of
    $145.3 million and a non-current deferred tax asset of
    $107.7 million as of July 2, 2010. The increase in the
    current deferred tax balances and the decrease in non-current
    deferred tax balances were primarily due to acquisitions. For
    all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we
    expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are
    sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income
    needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance
    related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $88.7 million as of
    July 1, 2011 and $80.3 million as of July 2,
    2010. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy
    of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss
    in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate



sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material
    change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within
    which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or
    deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning
    strategies changes, we could be required to increase the
    valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our
    deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our
    effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our
    operating results.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but
    have not yet been implemented by us are described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

in the Notes, which describes the potential
    impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from our historical results
    or our current expectations or projections. Other factors
    besides those listed here also could adversely affect us. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report for more
    information regarding factors that might cause our results to
    differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the
    forward-looking statements contained in this Report.

•

We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant
    portion of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a
    shift in U.S. Government funding priorities could have
    adverse consequences on our future business.

•

We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which
    often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase
    in inflation.

•

We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through
    cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant
    disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we
    operate for certain of our customers.

•

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business internationally, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates.

•

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the
    improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

•

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export
    licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may
    prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

•

The continued effects of the general downturn in the global
    economy and the U.S. Government’s budget deficits and
    national debt could have an adverse impact on our business,
    operating results or financial condition.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products, services and technologies that achieve market
    acceptance in our current and future markets.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

•

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our
    subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely
    deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our
    products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely
    or unsatisfactory manner.

•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

•

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

•

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.



•

We have significant operations in Florida and other locations
    that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of
    a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

•

Changes in the regulatory framework under which our managed
    satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations
    are operated could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

•

We rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our
    managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions, and
    any bandwidth constraints could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

•

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments

and/or

recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in substantial
    losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of
    operations.

•

We must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so
    could seriously harm us.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies
    and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk
    Management” in “Item 7. Management’s

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation (the “Company”)
    is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
    internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
    appropriate cost-benefit analysis, regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of July 1, 2011. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s
    assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the
    Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 1, 2011.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
    internal controls of CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc.
    (collectively, “CapRock”), which the Company acquired
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2011; the internal controls
    with respect to the Schlumberger group’s Global
    Connectivity Services business, substantially all the assets of
    which the Company acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2011 (“Schlumberger GCS”); and the internal controls
    of Carefx Corporation (“Carefx”), which the Company
    acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. CapRock,
    Schlumberger GCS and Carefx are included in the fiscal 2011
    consolidated financial statements of the Company. On a combined
    basis, as of July 1, 2011, total assets and net assets of
    CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, excluding goodwill and
    identifiable intangible assets, constituted 3.8 percent and
    5.1 percent of the Company’s total assets and net
    assets, respectively. On a combined basis, for the fiscal year
    ended July 1, 2011, revenue from CapRock, Schlumberger GCS
    and Carefx constituted 6.7 percent of the Company’s
    total revenue. Management will include the internal controls of
    CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx in its assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting for fiscal 2012.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears on page 61 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Harris Corporation as of July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
    comprehensive income and equity, for each of the three years in
    the period ended July 1, 2011. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Harris Corporation at July 1, 2011
    and July 2, 2010, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended July 1, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 1, 2011, based on criteria established
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 29, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited Harris Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 1, 2011, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Harris
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of CapRock Holdings, Inc., Schlumberger GCS and Carefx
    Corporation which are included in the fiscal 2011 consolidated
    financial statements of Harris Corporation. On a combined basis,
    as of July 1, 2011, total assets and net assets of CapRock
    Holdings, Inc., Schlumberger GCS and Carefx Corporation,
    excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets,
    constituted 3.8 percent and 5.1 percent of Harris
    Corporation’s total assets and net assets, respectively. On
    a combined basis, for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2011,
    revenue from CapRock Holdings, Inc., Schlumberger GCS and Carefx
    Corporation constituted 6.7 percent of Harris
    Corporation’s total revenue. Our audit of internal control
    over financial reporting of Harris Corporation also did not
    include an evaluation of the internal control over financial
    reporting of CapRock Holdings, Inc., Schlumberger GCS and Carefx
    Corporation.

In our opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 1, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation as of
    July 1, 2011 and July 2, 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and comprehensive
    income and equity, for each of the three years in the period
    ended July 1, 2011 of Harris Corporation and our report
    dated August 29, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— Our Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
    and its consolidated subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (these “Notes”), the
    terms “Harris,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Harris Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated. Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in
    the Notes relate solely to our continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

— Our Consolidated Financial
    Statements have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) and require management to make estimates and
    assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
    reporting period. These estimates are based on experience and
    other information available prior to issuance of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Materially different results
    can occur as circumstances change and additional information
    becomes known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
    Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2011 and 2010 included
    52 weeks. Fiscal 2009 included 53 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
    months when purchased. These investments include accrued
    interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Equity Securities

— We consider all
    of our

available-for-sale

securities as available for use in our current operations. All
    of our marketable equity securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses,
    net of taxes, included as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
    marketable equity securities

available-for-sale

are determined using the specific identification method. In
    instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
    the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
    of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
    an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an

“other-than-temporary”

impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the
    value of the investment security recorded on the financial
    statements and our current estimate of fair value is recognized
    as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is
    determined. We include our marketable equity securities in the
    “Other current assets” line item in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    cash and cash equivalents, marketable equity securities

available-for-sale,

accounts receivable, non-current receivables, notes receivable,
    accounts payable and short-term and long-term debt approximate
    their fair values. Fair values for long-term debt are based
    primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
    instruments. A discussion of fair values for our derivative
    financial instruments is included under the caption
    “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
    net realizable value and they do not bear interest. This value
    includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to
    reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances
    which is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We
    calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs,
    level of past due accounts and economic status of the customers.
    We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the
    term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded
    at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. See

Note 5: Receivables

for additional information
    regarding accounts receivable.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory
    quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and
    obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
    product demand and production requirements. See

Note 6:
    Inventories

for additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are carried on the basis of cost and include
    software capitalized for internal use. Depreciation of
    buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
    straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
    lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 45 years.
    The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
    range between 2 and 10 years. Amortization of internal-use
    software begins when the software is put into service and is
    based on the expected useful life of the software. The useful
    lives over which we amortize internal-use software generally
    range between 3



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and 7 years. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and
    Equipment

for additional information regarding property,
    plant and equipment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are not amortized. We perform annual (or under certain
    circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair value
    (determined by forecasting future cash flows) against their
    carrying value. We test goodwill for impairment using a two-step
    process. The first step is to identify potential impairment by
    comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its
    net book value, including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of
    corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. If the fair
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its adjusted net book value,
    goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and
    the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the
    adjusted net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares
    the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied
    fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in
    an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of
    goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
    goodwill recognized in a business combination. The fair value of
    the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and
    liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible
    assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the
    purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill, Note 9: Intangible Assets

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

for additional information regarding goodwill and
    intangible assets, including goodwill and intangible asset
    impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2009.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Finite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Long-lived assets, including finite-lived
    intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives. We assess the recoverability of the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with
    finite useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be
    recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based
    upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such
    assets. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash
    flows was less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
    would be recognized for the difference between the fair value
    and the carrying amount. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and
    Equipment, Note 9: Intangible Assets

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

for additional information regarding long-lived
    assets and intangible assets, including impairment charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

Capitalized Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed

— Costs incurred to acquire or create a
    computer software product are expensed when incurred as research
    and development until technological feasibility has been
    established for the product, at which point such costs are
    capitalized. Technological feasibility is normally established
    upon completion of a detailed program design. Capitalization of
    computer software costs ceases when the product is available for
    general release to customers. Costs of reproduction,
    documentation, training materials, physical packaging,
    maintenance and customer support are charged to cost of products
    sold as incurred. Capitalized software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed is evaluated for impairment periodically by
    comparing the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer
    software product to the net realizable value of that product. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a
    $24.4 million write-down of capitalized software in our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment based on market conditions
    that resulted in reduced levels of capital expenditures,
    including demand for Integrated Network Solutions’ software
    products. See

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other
    Long-Lived Assets

for additional information regarding
    impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2009.

Capitalized software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed
    had a net carrying value of $36.4 million at July 1,
    2011 and $27.1 million at July 2, 2010. Total
    amortization expense related to these capitalized software
    amounts for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $4.5 million,
    $3.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. The
    annual amortization of these capitalized software costs is the
    greater of the amount computed using (a) the ratio that
    current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of
    current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product
    or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining
    estimated economic life of the product. Based on this policy,
    the useful lives over which we amortize costs of computer
    software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed range from 2
    to 7 years. Amortization commences when the product is
    available for general release to customers. The capitalized
    costs, net of accumulated amortization, are reflected in the
    “Other non-current assets” line item in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amortization of capitalized
    software is included in the “Cost of product sales”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No current
    assets within the “Other current assets” line item in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our
    total current assets as of July 1, 2011 or July 2,
    2010. No assets within the “Other non-current assets”
    line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded
    5 percent of total assets as of July 1, 2011 or
    July 2, 2010. No accrued liabilities or expenses within the
    “Other accrued items” or “Other long-term
    liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    exceeded 5 percent of our total current liabilities or
    total liabilities, respectively, as of July 1, 2011 or
    July 2, 2010.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
    tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
    deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
    timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
    tax planning strategies. See

Note 23: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production
    contract sales in our Government Communications Systems and RF
    Communications segments, and in the government business in our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment, the value or price of our
    warranty is generally included in the contract and funded by the
    customer. A provision for warranties is built into the estimated
    program costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when
    applying the

cost-to-cost

percentage-of-completion

revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are
    charged to the specific program’s cost, and both revenue
    and cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the
    estimated program cost for warranties include terms of the
    contract, complexity of the delivered product or service, number
    of installed units, historical experience and management’s
    judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost
    per claim.

On product sales in all our segments, we provide for future
    warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific terms and
    conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product
    sold, customer and country in which we do business. In the case
    of products sold by us, our warranties start from the shipment,
    delivery or customer acceptance date and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to twelve years

Integrated Network Solutions

Less than one year to five years

Government Communications Systems

One to two years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
    customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
    those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
    warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, historical experience and
    management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
    warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
    our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
    adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Media, automation and asset management software products sold by
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment generally carry a

90-day

warranty from the date of shipment. Our liability under these
    warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of any portion
    of the software found not to be in substantial compliance with
    the specifications or, if we are unable to do so, to provide a
    full refund.

Software license agreements and sales contracts for broadcast
    and new media solutions products in our Integrated Network
    Solutions segment generally include provisions for indemnifying
    customers against certain specified liabilities should that
    segment’s products infringe certain intellectual property
    rights of third parties. Certain of our Integrated Network
    Solutions transmission systems customers have notified us of
    potential claims against us based on these standard
    indemnification provisions included in sales contracts between
    us and these customers. These indemnification claims arise from
    litigation brought by a third-party patent licensing company
    asserting alleged technology rights against these customers. We
    are cooperating with these customers in efforts to mitigate
    their litigation exposure. To date, we have not incurred
    material costs as a result of such indemnification and have not
    accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. See

Note 10: Accrued
    Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
    currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
    currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
    of exchange and income and expense items are



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the year.
    The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate
    component of shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based
    Compensation

— We measure compensation cost for
    all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at
    fair value and recognize cost over the vesting period. It is our
    policy to issue shares when options are exercised. See

Note 14: Stock Options and Other Share-Based
    Compensation

for additional information regarding
    share-based compensation.

Restructuring Costs

— We record restructuring
    charges for sales or terminations of product lines, closures or
    relocations of business activities, changes in management
    structure, and fundamental reorganizations that affect the
    nature and focus of operations. Such costs include one-time
    termination benefits, contract termination costs and costs to
    consolidate facilities or relocate employees. We record these
    charges at their fair value when incurred. In cases where
    employees are required to render service until they are
    terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and will
    be retained beyond the minimum retention period, we record the
    expense ratably over the future service period. These charges
    are included as a component of the “Engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, due to the global
    economic slowdown, pressure on Department of Defense
    (“DoD”) spending, and contract delays, we announced a
    number of cost-reduction actions across our business segments
    and at our corporate headquarters. We recorded charges, net of
    government cost reimbursement, of $17.8 million for
    severance and other employee-related exit costs and
    $4.5 million related to consolidation of facilities. As of
    the end of fiscal 2009, we had recorded liabilities associated
    with these restructuring activities of $26.5 million, of
    which the majority was paid during fiscal 2010.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
    following revenue recognition policies:

Development and Production Contracts:

Revenue
    and anticipated profits under development and production
    contracts are recorded on a

percentage-of-completion

basis, generally using the

cost-to-cost

method of accounting where sales and profits are recorded based
    on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at
    completion. Recognition of profit on fixed-price development and
    production contracts requires estimates of: the total contract
    value; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
    progress towards completion. Revenue and profits on
    cost-reimbursable development and production contracts are
    recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, and
    become billable to the customer, in an amount equal to the
    allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. Revenue in our
    Government Communications Systems segment primarily relates to
    development and production contracts.

Development and production contracts are combined when specific
    aggregation criteria are met. Criteria generally include closely
    interrelated activities performed for a single customer within
    the same economic environment. Development and production
    contracts are generally not segmented. If development and
    production contracts are segmented, we have determined that they
    meet specific segmenting criteria. Amounts representing
    development and production contract change orders, claims or
    other items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
    estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
    and awards applicable to performance on development and
    production contracts are considered in estimating sales and
    profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient
    information to assess anticipated contract performance.
    Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based solely on a
    single significant event, are generally not recognized until the
    event occurs. When adjustments in contract value or estimated
    costs are determined, any changes from prior estimates are
    reflected in earnings in the current period. Anticipated losses
    on development and production contracts or programs in progress
    are charged to earnings when identified.

Products and Services Other Than Development and Production
    Contracts:

Revenue from product sales other than
    development and production contracts and revenue from service
    arrangements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collectibility is reasonably assured, and delivery of a product
    has occurred and title has transferred or services have been
    rendered. Further, if an arrangement other than a development
    and production contract requires the delivery or performance of
    multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we
    determine whether the individual elements represent separate
    units of accounting. If they do, we recognize the revenue
    associated with each element separately and contract revenue is
    allocated among elements based on relative selling price. If the
    elements within a bundled sale are not considered separate units
    of accounting, they are accounted for as a combined unit of
    accounting and generally recognized over the performance period.
    Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by the
    straight-line method over the term of the contracts. Also, if
    contractual obligations related to customer acceptance exist,
    revenue is not recognized for a product or service



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

unless these obligations are satisfied. Revenue in our RF
    Communications Systems segment primarily relates to products and
    services other than development and production contracts.

Certain contracts include terms and conditions through which we
    recognize revenue upon completion of equipment production, which
    is subsequently stored at our location at the customer’s
    request. Revenue is recognized on such contracts upon the
    customer’s assumption of title and risk of ownership and
    when collectibility is reasonably assured. At the time of
    revenue recognition, there is a schedule of delivery of the
    product consistent with the customer’s business practices,
    we do not have any remaining performance obligations such that
    the earnings process is not complete and the product has been
    separated from our inventory.

Software Licenses:

The amount of revenue
    allocated to undelivered elements under bundled software
    licenses that are bundled with multi-year maintenance agreements
    is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual
    method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as
    indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as
    unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements
    is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned
    revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a
    straight-line basis over the maintenance agreement. In the case
    of software products for which we sell term-based licenses
    including multi-year maintenance agreements, but do not have
    vendor-specific objective evidence on the undelivered element,
    the entire arrangement is recognized ratably on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the license. Our Integrated Network
    Solutions segment derives a portion of its revenue from the
    licensing of software with multi-year maintenance arrangements.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a
    component of the “Non-operating loss” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis
    of terms specified in contractual agreements. Shipping and
    handling fees billed to customers are included in the
    “Revenue from product sales” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income and the associated costs are
    included in the “Cost of product sales” line item in
    our Consolidated Statement of Income. Also, we record taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from
    revenues.

Retirement Benefits

— As of July 1, 2011,
    we provide retirement benefits to substantially all

U.S.-based

employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
    plan that includes a 401(k) plan and certain non-qualified
    deferred compensation plans. The defined contribution retirement
    plan has matching and savings elements. Contributions by us to
    the retirement plan are based on employees’ savings with no
    other funding requirements. We may make additional contributions
    to the retirement plan at our discretion. Retirement benefits
    also include a defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom and an
    unfunded limited healthcare plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and employees on long-term disability. We accrue the
    estimated cost of these medical benefits, which are not
    material, during an employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expenses amounted to $60.0 million in
    fiscal 2011, $53.2 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $46.9 million in fiscal 2009.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
    environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
    of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
    contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
    existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
    costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 14 sites
    where future liabilities could exist. These sites include 2
    sites owned by us, 8 sites associated with our former graphics
    or semiconductor locations and 4 treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
    attributable to us from past operations. Based on an assessment
    of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
    liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”) and other environmental statutes and
    regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent
    discount rate, is approximately $4.5 million. The current
    portion of this liability is included in the “Other accrued
    items” line item and the non-current portion is included in
    the “Other long-term liabilities” line item in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate undiscounted
    amount that will be incurred over the next 10 years is
    approximately $6.1 million. The expected payments for the
    next five years are: fiscal 2012 — $0.8 million;
    fiscal 2013 — $0.9 million; fiscal
    2014 — $1.2 million; fiscal 2015 —
    $0.7 million; and fiscal 2016 —
    $0.6 million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is
    approximately $1.9 million. The relevant factors we
    considered in estimating our potential liabilities under the
    Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
    include cost-sharing agreements with other parties and the
    potential indemnification from successor and predecessor owners
    of these sites. We do not



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

believe that any uncertainties regarding these relevant factors
    will materially affect our potential liability under the
    Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
    Commitments

— Financial guarantees are contingent
    commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
    a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
    paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. As of
    July 1, 2011, there were no such contingent commitments
    accrued for in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. As of July 1, 2011, we had total
    commercial commitments, including debt and performance
    guarantees, of $740.3 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

— In
    the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. We recognize all derivatives in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that
    are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If
    the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
    changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset
    against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm
    commitments through earnings or recognized in other
    comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
    earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
    in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We do not
    hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

for additional information regarding our use of derivative
    instruments.

Income From Continuing Operations Per Share

—
    For all periods presented in this Report, income from continuing
    operations per share is computed using the two-class method as
    it is the more dilutive of the treasury stock or two-class
    methods. The two-class method of computing income from
    continuing operations per share is an earnings allocation
    formula that determines income from continuing operations per
    share for common stock and any participating securities
    according to dividends paid and participation rights in
    undistributed earnings. Our restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock unit awards, as well as our performance share
    awards and performance share unit awards granted prior to fiscal
    2011, meet the definition of participating securities and are
    included in the computations of income from continuing
    operations per basic and diluted common share. Our performance
    share awards and performance share unit awards granted beginning
    in fiscal 2011 do not meet the definition of participating
    securities because they do not contain rights to receive
    nonforfeitable dividends and, therefore, are excluded from the
    computations of income from continuing operations per basic and
    diluted common share. Under the two-class method, income from
    continuing operations per common share is computed by dividing
    the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and
    undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
    period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings
    are allocated to both common shares and participating securities
    based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the
    period. See

Note 15: Income From Continuing Operations
    Per Share

for additional information.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    to conform to current-year classifications.

NOTE 2:

ACCOUNTING
    CHANGES OR RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we adopted the following
    accounting standards, neither of which had a material impact on
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows:

•

The accounting standard that revises accounting and reporting
    requirements for arrangements with multiple deliverables. This
    standard allows the use of an estimated selling price to
    determine the selling price of a deliverable in cases where
    neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party
    evidence is available. Additionally, this standard requires the
    total selling price of a multiple-deliverable arrangement to be
    allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all
    deliverables based on relative selling prices.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•

The accounting standard that clarifies which revenue allocation
    and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that
    contain both tangible products and software, in cases where the
    software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a
    whole. More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded
    within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of
    the tangible product, then this software, as well as undelivered
    software elements that relate to this software, are excluded
    from the scope of existing software revenue guidance.

Accounting
    Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update that
    generally aligns the principles for fair value measurements and
    related disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and
    International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
    The amendments in this update include clarifications of the
    FASB’s intent about the application of existing fair value
    measurements and disclosure requirements and changes to
    particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value
    or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
    Expanded disclosure requirements include disclosures of all
    transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy, disclosure of the hierarchy classification for items
    whose fair value is not recorded on the balance sheet but is
    disclosed in the notes, and various quantitative and qualitative
    disclosures pertaining to Level 3 measurements. This update
    is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and
    annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011,
    which for us is our third quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not
    currently anticipate that the adoption of this update will
    materially impact our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update
    that requires entities to present components of net income,
    components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and
    total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two
    separate but consecutive statements. Entities will no longer be
    allowed to present OCI in the statement of equity. Additionally,
    this update requires entities to present on the face of the
    financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that
    are reclassified from OCI to net income in the statement(s)
    where the components of net income and OCI are presented. This
    update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for
    fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years,
    beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us is our
    fiscal 2013. The adoption of this update will not impact our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3:

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

On March 31, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved the Spin-off of all the shares of HSTX owned by us to
    our shareholders. On May 27, 2009, we completed the
    Spin-off through the distribution of our ownership of
    approximately 56 percent of the outstanding shares of HSTX
    in the form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders.
    Each of our shareholders received approximately 0.248418 of a
    share of HSTX Class A common stock for each share of our
    common stock such shareholder held as of 5:30 p.m. Eastern
    Time on May 13, 2009, the record date for the Spin-off. The
    distribution ratio was based on the number of shares of HSTX
    Class B common stock owned by us, which we exchanged for an
    equal number of shares of HSTX Class A common stock prior
    to the distribution in order to effect the Spin-off, divided by
    the number of shares of our common stock and common stock
    equivalents outstanding on the record date. Our shareholders of
    record on the record date received cash in lieu of any fraction
    of a HSTX share that they would have otherwise received in the
    Spin-off. In aggregate, we distributed 32,913,377 shares of
    HSTX Class A common stock to our shareholders. Based upon
    the $5.26 per share closing price for the HSTX Class A
    common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on May 26, 2009,
    the day prior to the date of the distribution, the aggregate
    market value of the shares distributed was $173.1 million.
    Our historical financial results have been restated to account
    for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods presented in
    this Report.

Prior to the Spin-off of HSTX, as of the end of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009, based on the current global economic
    environment and the decline of the market capitalization of
    HSTX, we performed an interim review for impairment of
    HSTX’s goodwill and its other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, consisting solely of the Stratex trade name. To test for
    potential impairment of HSTX’s goodwill, we determined the
    fair value of HSTX based on projected discounted cash flows and
    market-based multiples applied to sales and earnings. The
    results indicated an impairment of goodwill because the current
    carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value. We
    then allocated this fair value to HSTX’s underlying assets
    and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of goodwill,
    resulting in a $279.0 million charge to write down all of
    HSTX’s goodwill. We determined the fair value of the
    Stratex trade name by performing a projected discounted cash
    flow analysis based on the relief-from-royalty



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

approach, resulting in a $22.0 million charge to write down
    a majority of the carrying value of the Stratex trade name.
    Substantially all of the goodwill and the Stratex trade name
    were recorded in connection with the combination of Stratex and
    our Microwave Communications Division in January 2007.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2011 we made the following significant
    acquisitions:

•

Acquisition of CapRock.

On July 30, 2010,
    we acquired privately held CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc.
    (collectively, “CapRock”), a global provider of
    mission-critical, managed satellite communications services for
    the government, energy and maritime industries. CapRock’s
    solutions include broadband Internet access, voice over Internet
    Protocol (“VOIP”) telephony, wideband networking and
    real-time video, delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around
    the world. The acquisition of CapRock increased the breadth of
    our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The total net purchase
    price for CapRock was $517.5 million. Our fiscal 2011
    results of operations included revenue of $357.0 million
    and a pre-tax loss of $16.3 million (including
    $21.9 million of acquisition-related charges) associated
    with CapRock for the eleven-month period following the date of
    acquisition. We report CapRock as part of Managed Satellite and
    Terrestrial Communications Solutions under our Integrated
    Network Solutions segment.

•

Acquisition of Schlumberger GCS.

On
    April 4, 2011, we acquired from Schlumberger B.V. and its
    affiliates (“Schlumberger”) substantially all of the
    assets of the Schlumberger group’s Global Connectivity
    Services business (“Schlumberger GCS”), a provider of
    satellite and terrestrial communications services for the
    worldwide energy industry. The total net purchase price for
    Schlumberger GCS was $380.6 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. Our fiscal 2011 results of operations
    include revenue of $34.6 million and a pre-tax loss of
    $12.5 million (including $17.0 million of
    acquisition-related charges) associated with Schlumberger GCS
    for the three-month period following the date of acquisition. We
    report Schlumberger GCS as part of Managed Satellite and
    Terrestrial Communications Solutions under our Integrated
    Network Solutions segment.

•

Acquisition of Carefx.

Also on April 4,
    2011, we acquired privately held Carefx Corporation
    (“Carefx”), a provider of interoperability workflow
    solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers.
    Carefx’s solution suite is used by more than 800 hospitals,
    healthcare systems and health information exchanges across North
    America, Europe and Asia. The acquisition expanded our presence
    in government healthcare, provided entry into the commercial
    healthcare market and is expected to leverage the healthcare
    interoperability workflow products offered by Carefx and the
    broader scale of enterprise intelligence solutions and services
    that we provide. The total net purchase price for Carefx was
    $152.6 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. We
    report Carefx as part of Healthcare Solutions under our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment.

    post-closing adjustments. The purchase price allocations for all
    of these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to changes in
    the fair value of working capital and other assets and
    liabilities on the effective dates, completion of an appraisal
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and final valuation
    of intangible assets.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
    our unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the
    acquisitions of CapRock and Schlumberger GCS had been completed
    as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, after including in fiscal
    2010 integration and other costs associated with these
    acquisitions, and after including the impact of adjustments such
    as amortization of intangible assets and interest expense on
    related borrowings and, in each case, the related income tax
    effects. This pro forma presentation does not include any impact
    of transaction synergies. In the following table, “income

    for the entire periods presented.

During fiscal 2009 we made the following significant acquisition:

•

Acquisition of Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems
    Business

.  On May 29, 2009, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless
    systems business (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known
    as M/A-COM), an established provider of mission-critical
    wireless communications systems for law enforcement, fire and
    rescue, public service, utility and transportation markets. In
    connection with the acquisition, we assumed liabilities
    primarily related to Wireless Systems. We did not assume the
    State of New York wireless network contract awarded to Wireless
    Systems in December 2004. The total purchase price for Wireless
    Systems was $674.9 million. We report Wireless Systems,
    which we now call Public Safety and Professional Communications,
    within our RF Communications segment. We believe the acquisition
    created a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market.

The goodwill resulting from all the above acquisitions was
    associated primarily with the acquired companies’ market
    presence and leading positions, growth opportunities in the
    markets in which the acquired companies operated, experienced
    work forces and established operating infrastructures. The
    goodwill related to the Schlumberger GCS and Wireless Systems
    acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes, the goodwill
    related to the Carefx acquisition is nondeductible for tax
    purposes, and most of the goodwill related to the CapRock
    acquisition is nondeductible for tax purposes.

GOODWILL

We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at
    least annually for impairment. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

for information regarding impairment of
    HSTX’s goodwill and its other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets recorded in fiscal 2009. See

Note 22: Impairment
    of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for information
    regarding impairment of our Broadcast and New Media Solutions
    reporting unit’s goodwill recorded in fiscal 2009.

As discussed further in

Note 25: Business Segments

in these Notes, effective for the third quarter of fiscal
    2011, we changed our operating segment reporting structure,
    which also changed certain identified reporting units. As a
    result of these changes, we reallocated goodwill to the affected
    reporting units using the relative fair value approach, which
    resulted in changes in the goodwill balances by business segment
    at July 3, 2009 and at July 2, 2010 as presented below
    from amounts previously reported.

The goodwill resulting from acquisitions was associated
    primarily with the acquired companies’ market presence and
    leading positions, growth opportunities in the markets in which
    the acquired companies operated, experienced work forces and
    established operating infrastructures. The goodwill related to
    the Schlumberger GCS and Wireless Systems acquisitions is
    deductible for tax purposes, the goodwill related to the Carefx
    acquisition is nondeductible for tax purposes, and most of the
    goodwill related to the CapRock acquisition is nondeductible for
    tax purposes.

In the table above, the accumulated impairment losses in our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment related to Broadcast and
    New Media Solutions and were recorded in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009.

CREDIT
    ARRANGEMENTS

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement:

On
    September 29, 2010, we entered into a $300 million
    senior unsecured

364-day

revolving credit agreement (the

“364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders.
    The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit
    to us in the form of revolving loans at any time and from time
    to time during the term of the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at
    any time outstanding not to exceed $300 million. Borrowings
    under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement will be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars. The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and
    other general corporate purposes (excluding hostile
    acquisitions) and may also be used to support any commercial
    paper that we may issue.

At our election, borrowings under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest either at LIBOR
    plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable
    margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set at
    1.75 percent, may increase (to a maximum amount of
    2.25 percent) or decrease (to a minimum amount of
    1.25 percent) based on changes in the ratings of our senior
    unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”). The base rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the
    highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus
    0.50 percent, (ii) SunTrust Bank’s publicly
    announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars or
    (iii) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus
    1.00 percent. The interest rate margin over the base rate,
    initially set at 0.75 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.25 percent) or decrease (to a minimum amount of
    0.25 percent) based on our Senior Debt Ratings.

The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants,
    including covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets;
    certain mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale
    and leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing
    investments; and certain investments in unrestricted
    subsidiaries. The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement also requires that we not permit our
    ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each
    as defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and not permit our
    ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
    expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (measured
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement in fiscal 2011. The

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
    including: failure to make payments; failure to perform or
    observe terms, covenants and agreements; material



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

inaccuracy of any representation or warranty; payment default
    under other indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million, other default under such other indebtedness
    that permits acceleration of such indebtedness, or acceleration
    of such other indebtedness; occurrence of one or more final
    judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $75 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liability in excess of $75 million; any bankruptcy or
    insolvency; or a change of control, including if a person or
    group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of
    our voting stock. If an event of default occurs the lenders may,
    among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all
    outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable
    together with accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or
    outstanding under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 28, 2011, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 1, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the

364-Day

Revolving Credit Agreement.

2008 Credit Agreement:

On
    September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any time and from time to time during the term of the
    2008 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
    time outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both
    revolving loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be
    guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We also may designate certain
    subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain
    of the covenants and representations in the 2008 Credit
    Agreement do not apply to such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on our Senior Debt Ratings and on the
    degree of utilization under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    (“Utilization”). The base rate is a fluctuating rate
    equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus
    0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced
    prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest rate
    margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then
    the interest rate margin over the base rate will increase to
    either 0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on
    Utilization. Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear
    interest at LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over
    LIBOR described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined
    based on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants,
    including covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets;
    certain mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale
    and leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing
    investments; and certain investments in unrestricted
    subsidiaries. The 2008 Credit Agreement also requires that we
    not permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total
    capital, each as defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and
    not permit our ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net
    interest expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00
    (measured on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the 2008 Credit Agreement in fiscal 2011. The 2008
    Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including:
    failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms,
    covenants and agreements; material inaccuracy of any
    representation or warranty; payment default under other
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million, other default under such other indebtedness
    that permits acceleration of such indebtedness, or acceleration
    of such other indebtedness; occurrence of one or more final
    judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $75 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liability in excess of $75 million; any bankruptcy or
    insolvency; or a change of control, including if a person or
    group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of
    our voting stock. If an event of default occurs the lenders may,
    among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all
    outstanding



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 1, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had $180.0 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program, that was supported by our senior unsecured revolving
    credit facility under the 2008 Credit Agreement.

Other:

We have an automatically
    effective, universal shelf registration statement, filed with
    the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to the potential future
    issuance of an indeterminate amount of securities, including
    debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, fractional
    interests in preferred stock represented by depositary shares
    and warrants to purchase debt securities, preferred stock or
    common stock.

The potential maturities of long-term debt, including the

    $7.8 million in fiscal 2013; $3.6 million in fiscal
    2014; none in fiscal 2015; $300.0 million in fiscal 2016;
    and $1,575.8 million thereafter. All of our outstanding
    long-term debt is unsubordinated and unsecured with equal
    ranking.

On December 3, 2010, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    4.4% Notes due December 15, 2020 (the “2020
    Notes”) and $300 million in aggregate principal amount
    of 6.15% Notes due December 15, 2040 (the “2040
    Notes”). Interest on each of the 2020 Notes and the 2040
    Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and
    December 15 of each year. We may redeem the 2020 Notes

and/or

the
    2040 Notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part
    at the applicable “make-whole” redemption price. The
    applicable “make-whole” redemption price is equal to
    the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the
    notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 25 basis
    points in the case of the 2020 Notes and 35 basis points in
    the case of the 2040 Notes. In each case, we will pay accrued
    interest on the principal amount of the notes being redeemed to
    the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of control
    combined with a below-investment-grade rating event, we may be
    required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price
    equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of
    the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes
    repurchased to the date of repurchase. We incurred
    $5.5 million and $4.8 million in debt issuance costs
    and discounts related to the issuance of the 2020 Notes and 2040
    Notes, respectively, which are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the respective lives of the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method,
    and are reflected as a portion of interest expense in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the
    notes, we entered into treasury lock agreements to protect
    against fluctuations in forecasted interest payments resulting
    from the issuance of ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in
    the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. These agreements were
    determined to be highly effective in offsetting changes in
    forecasted interest payments as a result of changes in the
    benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these
    agreements on December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of
    $5.5 million, net of income tax, in shareholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    This loss, along with $5.0 million in debt issuance costs,
    is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
    notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method,
    and is reflected as a portion of interest expense in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.0% Notes due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes
    is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem
    the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the
    “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the
    option of the holders of the debentures. We may redeem the
    remaining $25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures in whole, or in part, at any time at a
    pre-determined redemption price.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

STOCK
    OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of July 1, 2011, we had two shareholder-approved
    employee stock incentive plans (“SIPs”) under which
    options or other share-based compensation was outstanding, and
    we had the following types of share-based awards outstanding
    under our SIPs: stock options, performance share awards,
    performance share unit awards, restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock unit awards. We believe that such awards more
    closely align the interests of employees with those of
    shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated
    vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our
    SIPs).

Shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance
    under our SIPs totaled 15,978,745 as of July 1, 2011. In
    fiscal 2011, we issued an aggregate of 984,187 shares of
    common stock under the terms of our SIPs, which is net of shares
    withheld for tax purposes.

Stock
    Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under shareholder-approved SIPs. Option exercise
    prices are equal to or greater than the fair market value of our
    common stock on the date the options are granted, using the
    closing stock price of our common stock. Options may be
    exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally
    ranges from seven to ten years after the date of grant, and they
    generally become exercisable in installments, which are
    typically 33.3 percent one year from the grant date,
    33.3 percent two years from the grant date and
    33.3 percent three years from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which
    uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on
    our common stock and the historical volatility of our stock
    price over the expected term of the options. The expected term
    of the options is based on historical observations of our common
    stock over the past ten years, considering average years to
    exercise for all options exercised, average years to
    cancellation for all options cancelled and average years
    remaining for outstanding options, which is calculated based on
    the weighted-average vesting period plus the weighted-average of
    the difference between the vesting period and average years to



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

exercise and cancellation. The risk-free interest rate for
    periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
    the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
    grant.

    options granted under our SIPs. This cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.58 years.
    The total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal
    2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $17.8 million,
    $16.8 million and $12.3 million, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
    under our SIPs. The restricted stock and restricted stock units
    are not transferable until vested and the restrictions lapse
    upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified
    time period.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
    closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 1, 2011, there were 712,447 shares of restricted
    stock outstanding.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 1, 2011, we had 101,400 restricted stock units
    outstanding, all of which were payable in shares.

    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.64 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share
    of restricted stock and per unit of restricted stock units
    granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $44.73, $36.45 and
    $50.57, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that vested during fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009 was approximately $6.7 million, $8.3 million
    and $5.1 million, respectively.

Performance
    Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares and performance share units that have been granted to
    employees under our SIPs. Generally, performance share and
    performance share unit awards are subject to performance
    criteria such as meeting predetermined operating income and
    return on invested capital targets (and total shareholder
    returns, for such awards granted beginning fiscal 2011) for
    a three-year performance period. These awards also generally
    vest at the expiration of the same three-year period. The final
    determination of the number of shares to be issued in respect of
    an award is determined by our Board of Directors or a committee
    of our Board of Directors.

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of our common stock on the date of grant and is amortized
    to compensation expense over the vesting period, if achievement
    of the performance measures is considered probable. At
    July 1, 2011, there were 847,627 performance shares
    outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period, if
    achievement of the performance measures is considered probable.
    At July 1, 2011, there were 50,670 performance share units
    outstanding, all of which were payable in shares.

    stock were outstanding at the end of fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, but were not included as dilutive stock options in
    the computations of income from continuing operations per
    diluted common share because the effect would have been
    antidilutive as the options’ exercise prices exceeded the
    average market price of our common stock.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs were $335.6 million,
    $325.8 million and $243.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, and are included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
    Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred
    pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for
    principally by the

cost-to-cost

percentage-of-completion

method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
    incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require
    us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined
    performance or other specifications (such as designs).
    Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $647.3 million, $720.9 million and $759.2 million
    in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Customer-sponsored
    research and development is included in our revenue and cost of

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to $52.7 million,

    and 2009, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under
    leases with an initial lease term in excess of one year,
    primarily for land and buildings, amounted to approximately
    $223.2 million at July 1, 2011. These commitments for
    the five years following fiscal 2011 and, in total, thereafter
    are: fiscal 2012 — $51.0 million; fiscal
    2013 — $39.1 million; fiscal 2014 —
    $32.2 million; fiscal 2015 — $25.1 million;

    unusual provisions or conditions. We do not consider any of
    these individual leases material to our operations. Leasehold
    improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during
    the lease term are amortized over the current lease term, or
    estimated life, if shorter.

NOTE 19:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. We recognize all derivatives in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We do not hold or
    issue derivatives for trading purposes.

At July 1, 2011, we had open foreign currency forward
    contracts with a notional amount of $83.9 million, of which
    $30.2 million were classified as fair value hedges and
    $53.7 million were classified as cash flow hedges. This
    compares with open foreign currency forward contracts with a
    notional amount of $46.5 million at July 2, 2010, of
    which $30.3 million were classified as fair value hedges
    and $16.2 million were classified as cash flow hedges. At
    July 1, 2011, contract expiration dates ranged from less
    than 1 month to 33 months with a weighted average
    contract life of 9 months.

Balance
    Sheet Hedges

To manage the exposure in our balance sheet to risks from
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we implement fair
    value hedges. More specifically, we use foreign currency forward
    contracts and options to hedge certain balance sheet items,
    including foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and
    inventory. Changes in the value of the derivatives and the
    related hedged items are reflected in earnings, in the
    “Cost of product sales” line item in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income. As of July 1, 2011, we had outstanding
    foreign currency forward contracts denominated in the Euro,
    British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar to hedge
    certain balance sheet items. The net gains or losses on foreign
    currency forward contracts designated as fair value hedges were
    not material in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. In addition, no
    amounts were recognized in earnings in fiscal 2011, 2010 and
    2009 related to hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify
    as fair value hedges.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

To manage our exposure to currency risk and market fluctuation
    risk associated with anticipated cash flows that are probable of
    occurring in the future, we implement cash flow hedges. More
    specifically, we use foreign currency forward contracts and
    options to hedge off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments, including purchase commitments from suppliers,
    future committed sales to customers and intercompany
    transactions. These derivatives are primarily being used to
    hedge currency exposures from cash flows anticipated in our RF
    Communications segment related to programs in the United Kingdom
    and Canada. We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to
    suppliers to maintain our anticipated profit margins in our
    international operations. As of July 1, 2011, we had
    outstanding foreign currency forward contracts denominated in
    the British Pound and Canadian Dollar to hedge certain
    forecasted transactions.

These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
    of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
    anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
    effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
    anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
    used to hedge these cash flows. These financial instruments are

marked-to-market

using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to
    other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. Gains
    and losses from other comprehensive income are reclassified to
    earnings when the related hedged item is recognized in earnings.
    The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair
    value is immediately recognized in earnings. The cash flow
    impact of our derivatives is included in the same category in
    our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of
    the item being hedged.

The amount of gains or losses from cash flow hedges recognized
    in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income, including
    gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness, was not
    material in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. We do not expect the
    amount of gains or losses recognized in the “Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss)” line item in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1, 2011 that will be
    reclassified to earnings from other comprehensive income within
    the next 12 months to be material.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Credit
    Risk

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
    by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
    based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to any single
    counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
    position with each counterparty.

IMPAIRMENT
    OF GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Based on our policy as described at

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in
    these Notes, we test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment annually, as well as when
    events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our annual
    review for impairment of our reporting units’ goodwill and
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets. To test for potential
    impairment, we determined the fair value of our reporting units
    based on projected discounted cash flows and market-based
    multiples applied to sales and earnings. Because of the global
    recession and postponement of capital projects which
    significantly weakened demand, and the general decline of peer
    company valuations impacting our valuation, it appeared that
    goodwill in our Broadcast and New Media Solutions reporting unit
    (formerly a separate reportable segment and which, effective for
    the third quarter of fiscal 2011, is reported under our
    Integrated Network Solutions segment) was impaired. This was
    based on the results of step one testing that indicated the
    adjusted net book value of this reporting unit exceeded its fair
    value. We then allocated this fair value to Broadcast and New
    Media Solutions’ underlying assets and liabilities to
    determine the implied fair value of goodwill.

In conjunction with the above-described impairment review, we
    conducted a review for impairment of Broadcast and New Media
    Solutions’ other long-lived assets, including amortizable
    intangible assets and capitalized software, as any impairment of
    these assets must be considered prior to the conclusion of the
    impairment review. The fair value of Broadcast and New Media
    Solutions’ other long-lived assets was determined based on
    projected discounted cash flows based on future sales and
    operating costs, except for product trade names, for which we
    projected discounted cash flows based on the relief-from-royalty
    method.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As a result of these impairment reviews, we determined that the
    goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and capitalized software
    for Broadcast and New Media Solutions were impaired.
    Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, our
    Broadcast and New Media Solutions reporting unit recorded a
    $255.5 million impairment charge, consisting of charges of
    $160.9 million, $70.2 million and $24.4 million
    for impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and
    capitalized software, respectively.

United States income taxes have not been provided on

    subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest those earnings
    indefinitely. Determination of unrecognized deferred
    U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and
    credit carryforwards as of July 1, 2011 have expiration
    dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
    instances. The amount of Federal, international, and state and
    local tax loss carryforwards as of July 1, 2011 were
    $57.8 million, $80.0 million and $10.7 million,
    respectively. Income (loss) from continuing operations before
    income taxes of international subsidiaries was
    $8.9 million, $(4.9) million and $(59.3) million
    in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income taxes paid
    were $322.4 million, $280.5 million and
    $308.4 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    The valuation allowance increased $8.4 million from
    $80.3 million at the end of fiscal 2010 to
    $88.7 million at the end of fiscal 2011. The valuation
    allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes
    to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due
    to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the

As of July 1, 2011, we had $48.4 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, of which $35.4 million would
    favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax
    benefits are eventually recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. We
    had accrued $3.5 million for the potential payment of
    interest and penalties as of July 2, 2010 (and this amount
    was not included in the $33.2 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits balance at July 2, 2010 shown above) and
    $2.4 million of this total could favorably impact future
    tax rates. We had accrued $7.0 million for the potential
    payment of interest and penalties as of July 1, 2011 (and
    this amount was not included in the $48.4 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits balance at July 1, 2011 shown
    above) and $5.3 million of this total could favorably
    impact future tax rates.

We file numerous separate and consolidated income tax returns
    reporting our financial results and, where appropriate, those of
    our subsidiaries and affiliates, in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign
    jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Compliance Assurance Process, the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining fiscal
    2010, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012. We are currently under
    examination by the Canadian Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2005
    through 2010, and we are appealing portions of a Canadian
    assessment relating to fiscal years 2000 through 2004. We are
    currently under examination by various state and international
    tax authorities for fiscal years ranging from 1997 through 2010.
    It is reasonably possible that there could be a significant
    decrease

or increase to our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the
    course of the next twelve months as these examinations continue,
    other tax examinations commence or various statutes of
    limitations expire. An estimate of the range of possible changes
    cannot be made because of the significant number of
    jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax
    periods.

NOTE 24:

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal
    market (or most advantageous market, in the absence of a
    principal market) for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    Further, entities are required to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring
    fair value, and to utilize a three-level fair value hierarchy
    that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The
    three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted
    prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for
    similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
    for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
    are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are
    observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by,
    observable market data by correlation or other means.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities, and reflect our own
    assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best
    information available in the circumstances.

The following table represents the fair value hierarchy of our
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis (at least annually) as of July 1, 2011:

NOTE 25:

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our operations in the following three
    reportable operating or business segments — RF
    Communications, Integrated Network Solutions and Government
    Communications Systems. Our RF Communications segment is a
    global supplier of secure tactical radio communications and
    embedded high-grade encryption solutions for military,
    government and commercial organizations and also of secure
    communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility
    and transportation markets. Our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment provides mission-critical

end-to-end

information technology (“IT”) services; managed
    satellite and terrestrial communications solutions;
    standards-based healthcare interoperability and image management
    solutions; cyber integrated and cloud application hosting
    solutions; and digital media management solutions to support
    government, energy, healthcare, enterprise and broadcast
    customers. Our Government Communications Systems segment
    conducts advanced research and produces, integrates and supports
    highly reliable, net-centric communications and information
    technology that solve the mission-critical challenges of our
    civilian, defense and intelligence government customers,
    primarily the U.S. Government. Each business segment is
    comprised of multiple program areas and product and service
    lines that aggregate into such business segment.

As discussed further in the “Business
    Considerations — General” discussion in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this
    Report, our reportable operating segment structure reflects
    that, effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as a
    result of a realignment of our operations and as previously
    reported, we formed our Integrated Network Solutions as a new
    business segment. The new segment realigns IT Services, Managed
    Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions, Healthcare
    Solutions and Cyber Integrated Solutions (all of which were
    formerly under our Government Communications Systems segment)
    with Broadcast and New Media Solutions (formerly a separate
    reportable segment called Broadcast Communications). Our
    Government Communications Systems segment now is comprised of
    Civil Programs, Defense Programs and National Intelligence
    Programs. Our RF Communications segment did not change and
    continues to be comprised of U.S. Department of Defense and
    International Tactical Communications and Public Safety and
    Professional Communications. The historical results, discussion
    and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes
    to our reportable operating segment structure for all periods
    presented in this Report.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a taxable pro rata
    dividend to our shareholders of all the shares of HSTX common
    stock owned by us, we eliminated our former HSTX business
    segment, which is reported as discontinued operations in this
    Report. Until the Spin-off, HSTX (formerly our Microwave
    Communications segment), a provider of wireless network
    solutions, was our majority-owned subsidiary, and HSTX’s
    results of operations and financial position were consolidated
    into our financial statements. Subsequent to the Spin-off, we no
    longer own an equity interest in HSTX and, therefore, HSTX no
    longer constitutes part of our business operations. Our
    historical financial results have been restated to account for
    HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods presented in
    this Report. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

in
    these Notes for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

The accounting policies of our business segments are the same as
    those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

in these Notes. We evaluate each segment’s
    performance based on its “operating income (loss),”
    which we define as profit or loss from operations before income
    taxes excluding interest income and expense, royalties and
    related intellectual property expenses, equity income and gains
    or losses from securities and other investments. Intersegment
    sales among our segments are transferred at cost to the buying
    segment and the sourcing segment recognizes a normal profit that
    is eliminated. The “Corporate eliminations” line item
    in the tables below



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

represents the elimination of intersegment sales and their
    related profits. The “Unallocated corporate expense”
    line item in the tables below represents the portion of
    corporate expenses not allocated to the business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
    States with international revenue derived primarily from
    exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
    exceeded 4 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2011,
    2010 or 2009.

Sales made to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, by all segments as a
    percentage of total revenue were 71.6 percent,
    74.8 percent and 74.0 percent in fiscal 2011, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. Revenue from services in fiscal 2011 was
    approximately 6.1 percent, 64.8 percent and
    20.3 percent of total revenue in our RF Communications,
    Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications
    Systems segments, respectively.

NOTE 26:

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
    of businesses in which we are, or were, engaged, various claims
    or charges are asserted and litigation or arbitration is
    commenced by or against us arising from or related to matters
    including, but not limited to: product liability; personal
    injury; patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual
    property; labor and employee disputes; commercial or contractual
    disputes; the sale or use of former products containing asbestos
    or other restricted materials; breach of warranty; or
    environmental matters. Claimed amounts against us may be
    substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the
    merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court or
    arbitral awards. We record accruals for losses related to those
    matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can
    be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are
    recognized when they are realized and legal costs are expensed
    when incurred. While it is not feasible to predict



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the outcome of these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits,
    claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably
    to us, based upon available information, in the opinion of
    management, settlements, arbitration awards and final judgments,
    if any, which are considered probable of being rendered against
    us in litigation or arbitration in existence at July 1,
    2011 are reserved for, covered by insurance or would not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in
    jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result
    in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently
    resolved with the authorities or ultimately through established
    legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any
    ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits;
    however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the
    amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 27:

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

On July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the
    $1 billion New Repurchase Program that replaced the 2009
    Repurchase Program, which had a remaining, unused authorization
    of approximately $200 million. The New Repurchase Program
    does not have a stated expiration date. Repurchases under the
    New Repurchase Program may be made through open market
    purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through
    investment banking institutions, or any combination thereof. The
    timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject to
    market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors
    and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued
    at any time. We began repurchasing shares under the New
    Repurchase Program in August 2011.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
    the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the
    effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
    procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
    circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
    Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
    can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control
    objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures. As required by

Rule 13a-15

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2011, we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This
    evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this work
    and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has
    concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2011 our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We
    periodically review our internal control over financial
    reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal
    control over financial reporting to identify potential changes
    to our processes and systems that may improve controls and
    increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an
    effective internal control environment. Changes may include such
    activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
    consolidating the activities of business units, migrating
    certain processes to our shared services organizations,
    formalizing policies and procedures, improving segregation of
    duties, and adding additional monitoring controls. In addition,
    when we acquire new businesses, we incorporate our controls and
    procedures into the acquired business as part of our integration
    activities. There have been no changes in our internal control
    over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    July 1, 2011 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
    assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of the end of fiscal 2011 and concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of the end of fiscal 2011. Our management excluded from its
    assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting the internal controls of CapRock, which we
    acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2011; the internal
    controls with respect to Schlumberger GCS, which we acquired
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011; and the internal
    controls of Carefx, which we acquired during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2011. CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx are
    included in our fiscal 2011 consolidated financial statements.
    Our management will include the internal controls of CapRock,
    the internal controls with respect to Schlumberger GCS and the
    internal controls of Carefx in its assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    for fiscal 2012. “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting” is included within
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report. The effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting was audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm. Their unqualified report is included within
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report.

Consists of the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and
    the Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (As Amended
    and Restated Effective August 27, 2010) (the “2005
    Equity Incentive Plan”). No additional awards may be
    granted under the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

(2)

Under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in addition to options, we
    have granted share-based compensation awards in the form of
    performance shares, restricted stock, performance share units,
    restricted stock units, or other similar types of share awards.
    As of July 1, 2011, there were 1,712,144 such awards
    outstanding under that plan. The outstanding awards consisted of
    (i) 1,560,074 performance share awards and restricted stock
    awards, for which all 1,560,074 shares were issued and
    outstanding; and (ii) 152,070 performance share unit awards
    and restricted stock unit awards, for which all 152,070 were
    payable in shares but for which no shares were yet issued and
    outstanding. The 7,376,159 shares to be issued upon
    exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights as listed
    in column (a) consisted of shares to be issued in respect
    of the exercise of 7,224,089 outstanding options and in respect
    of the 152,070 performance share unit awards and restricted
    stock units awards payable in shares. Because there is no
    exercise price associated with performance share awards or
    restricted stock awards or with performance share units awards
    or restricted stock unit awards, all of which are granted to
    employees at no cost, such awards are not included in the
    weighted average exercise price calculation in column (b).
