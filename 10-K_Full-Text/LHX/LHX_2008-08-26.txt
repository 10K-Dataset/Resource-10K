General

We report our financial results for fiscal 2008 in the following
    four business segments:

•

Our Defense Communications and Electronics segment, which was
    comprised of our (i) RF Communications and
    (ii) Defense Programs businesses;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, which was
    comprised of our (i) Civil Programs, (ii) National
    Intelligence Programs and (iii) IT Services businesses;

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, which was comprised of our
    (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Television and Radio
    Transmission Systems businesses; and

•

Our Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Harris Stratex
    Networks”) segment (formerly Microwave Communications),
    which was comprised of our (i) North America Microwave,
    (ii) International Microwave and (iii) Network
    Operations businesses.

As discussed further in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this
    Annual Report on Form

10-K

(the
    “Notes”), effective for fiscal 2008 (which began
    June 30, 2007), our Defense Programs business (part of our
    Government Communications Systems segment for fiscal
    2007) was combined with our RF Communications business, and
    the combined business is reported as our Defense Communications
    and Electronics segment for fiscal 2008. Our Broadcast
    Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments
    did not



change as a result of these adjustments to our organizational
    structure. The historical results, discussion and presentation
    of our business segments as set forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

reflect the impact of these adjustments to our organizational
    structure for all periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As described in greater detail below under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment for
    Fiscal 2008 — Harris Stratex Networks,” in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2007, we combined our former Microwave
    Communications Division with Stratex Networks, Inc.
    (“Stratex”), a publicly-traded provider of high-speed
    wireless transmission systems, to form a new company named
    Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. As of June 27, 2008, we owned
    approximately 56 percent of Harris Stratex Networks’
    outstanding stock. Following the combination, our business
    segment formerly referred to as Microwave Communications is
    referred to as Harris Stratex Networks and includes the results
    of the combined businesses for periods following the
    combination. Financial information with respect to all of our
    other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of Headquarters Expense or Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Each of our business segments has been organized on the basis of
    specific communications markets. Each business segment has its
    own marketing, engineering and product service and maintenance
    organizations. Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex
    Networks have their own separate manufacturing operations.
    Defense Communications and Electronics and Government
    Communications Systems have both separate and shared
    manufacturing operations. We manufacture most of the finished
    products we sell.

On August 5, 2008, we announced that we would report our
    financial results for fiscal 2009 (which began June 28,
    2008) in the following four business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, which will be
    comprised of our (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National
    Intelligence Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and
    (iv) IT Services businesses;

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, which will be comprised of
    our (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Television and Radio
    Transmission Systems businesses; and

•

Our Harris Stratex Networks segment, which will be comprised of
    our (i) North America Microwave, (ii) International
    Microwave and (iii) Network Operations businesses.

Our segment reporting structure for fiscal 2009 reflects that
    our RF Communications business (part of our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment for fiscal
    2008) will be reported as its own separate segment for
    fiscal 2009, and that our Defense Programs business (the other
    part of our Defense Communications and Electronics segment for
    fiscal 2008) will be reported as part of our Government
    Communications Systems segment for fiscal 2009, together with
    that segment’s existing businesses (National Intelligence
    Programs, Civil Programs and IT Services). Our Broadcast
    Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments will not
    change as a result of the adjustments to our segment reporting
    structure. These adjustments to our segment reporting take
    effect in fiscal 2009 and therefore do not affect the historical
    results, discussion or presentation of our business segments as
    set forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We will begin to report our financial results consistent with
    this new segment reporting structure beginning with the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and we will conform our historical
    segment reporting accordingly.

Our total revenue was approximately $5.3 billion in fiscal
    2008 compared with approximately $4.2 billion in fiscal
    2007. Total revenue in the United States increased
    23 percent from fiscal 2007 while international revenue,
    amounting to 24 percent of our total revenue in fiscal
    2008, increased 33 percent from fiscal 2007. Our net income
    was $444.2 million in fiscal 2008 compared with
    $480.4 million in fiscal 2007.

Financial
    Information About Our Business
    Segments

Financial information with respect to our business segments,
    including revenue, operating income or loss and total assets,
    and with respect to our operations outside the United States, is
    contained in

Description
    of Business by Segment for Fiscal

Defense
    Communications and Electronics

For fiscal 2008, Defense Communications and Electronics was
    comprised of our RF Communications and Defense Programs
    businesses. These two businesses have developed significant
    technology-based capabilities that are directly targeted to a
    diverse base of U.S. and international defense customers
    and their continuing needs for more complex, secure
    communications and information technology networks.



RF Communications:

We offer to the global
    tactical radio market a comprehensive line of highly secure
    software-defined radio products and systems for manpack,
    handheld, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
    applications, supporting our customers’ critical missions.
    These radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and
    capable of supporting diverse mission requirements. Our
    Falcon

®

family of tactical radios includes the Falcon
    II

®

secure high-frequency, very high-frequency, ultra high-frequency
    and multiband handheld, manpack and vehicular radio systems; the
    Falcon
    III

®

multiband, multimode, multimission handheld, manpack, vehicular
    and high-capacity data radios; and the Secure Personal Radio.
    These radios are built on a platform that is reprogrammable to
    add features or software upgrades, addressing the increasing
    need for an integrated high-frequency, very high-frequency and
    ultra high-frequency communications system. The platform also
    provides interconnectivity among land-based and wireless
    communications media. These radios also have military-strength
    embedded encryption and can be linked to computers, providing
    network capabilities on the battlefield. Our Falcon II and
    Falcon III radios are being installed on new Mine Resistant
    Ambush Protected (“MRAP”) vehicles for the
    U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. In fiscal
    2008, we received an order from the U.S. Army to supply
    Falcon II high-frequency vehicular radio systems for High
    Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (“HMMWVs”) and
    other vehicles. We also announced in fiscal 2008 that the
    U.S. Army is installing Joint Tactical Radio System
    (“JTRS”)-approved Falcon III handheld radios in
    Shadow 200 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (“UAVs”) to serve
    as critical links in a relay system to extend significantly the
    communications capabilities of ground forces operating in
    obstructed line-of-sight environments.

The Falcon III is the next-generation family of
    software-defined tactical radios which have been developed to
    address the JTRS requirements. Falcon III radios provide
    multimode capability, including secure, ultra high-frequency
    ground-to-ground line-of-sight communications, close-air
    support, and long-range tactical satellite communications, as
    well as programmable encryption. Falcon III radios offer
    operational flexibility by addressing a full range of evolving
    mission requirements, including backwards compatibility and
    interoperability with legacy systems, such as Single Channel
    Ground and Airborne Systems (“SINCGARS”), and are
    software upgradeable to incorporate new waveforms as they are
    developed. The AN/PRC-152 Falcon III multiband handheld is
    the first widely fielded tactical radio to be certified without
    waivers by the Joint Program Executive Office (“JPEO”)
    as fully compliant with the JTRS Software Communications
    Architecture (“SCA”). The Falcon III handheld
    radio also has been certified by the National Security Agency
    (“NSA”) for the protection of voice and data traffic
    up through the TOP SECRET/SCI level. In fiscal 2007, we
    introduced the Falcon III multiband, multimission, manpack
    tactical radio, which combines traditional multiband radio
    features with new capabilities such as extended frequency range
    to 2 gigahertz, commercial L-Band satellite communications
    (“SATCOM”) and wideband mobile ad hoc networking, and
    we received certification from the NSA for the Falcon III
    manpack in fiscal 2008. The Falcon III manpack is the first
    wideband networking radio to utilize the JTRS SCA and receive
    NSA Type 1 certification for the protection of voice and data
    traffic up through the TOP SECRET level. In July 2008, the
    Falcon III manpack became the first manpack radio with
    wideband networking capability to be certified as SCA-compliant
    by the JTRS JPEO. In fiscal 2007, we also introduced the very
    small Secure Personal Radio that delivers secure, tactical
    digital communications to individual soldiers, and a
    high-capacity, line-of-site (“HCLOS”) data radio. The
    HCLOS data radio is a lightweight broadband Ethernet system that
    can securely transmit encrypted Internet Protocol
    (“IP”) traffic over distances greater than
    50 kilometers under clear line-of-sight conditions in fixed
    point-to-point and 20 kilometers in point-to-multipoint
    configurations, and can support throughput in excess of 80
    megabits per second in a military application of
    802.16 WiMax technology for high-speed IP data
    communications, providing ground troops the ability to send
    secure, high-bandwidth data between command posts and
    forward-operating bases.

We are a leader in multiband frequency radios, which allow
    operators to perform multiple functions on different frequency
    bands, eliminating the need and inconvenience of carrying
    multiple radios. This capability has become increasingly
    important to global military and peacekeeping forces as they
    upgrade communications for joint missions. This capability is
    also important for different Federal, state and local
    authorities confronting difficulty in communicating directly
    with one another during emergency operations, due to the large
    number of frequency bands and technologies used in today’s
    two-way land mobile radio communications systems, without
    relying on additional infrastructure or radio gateway equipment.
    Introduced in fiscal 2008, our new RF-1033M Multiband Multimode
    Land Mobile Radio delivers true real-time interoperable
    communications to address this difficulty by providing direct,
    secure multi-agency communications across multiple frequency
    bands (very high-frequency and ultra

high-frequency

bands) in a single portable radio for the growing public safety,
    homeland security and first responder markets. The RF-1033M
    Multiband Multimode Land Mobile Radio is a rugged,
    mission-critical communications platform for joint operations,
    built to the same standards as our proven military tactical
    radio products, and features true software-defined radio
    architecture, which provides flexibility and capacity for future
    growth while protecting our customers’ investments with
    software-enabled technology migrations. In July 2008, we
    introduced the
    Unity

tm

XG-100 land

mobile radio, the newest product in a family of multiband
    software-defined radios that will give



Federal, state and local public safety responders the ability to
    communicate using a single radio across multiple frequencies
    with virtually any agency responding to an emergency. The Unity
    XG-100 expands on the capabilities of the RF-1033M and extends
    the covered frequency range to include the 700/800 megahertz
    bands.

We also develop cryptographic solutions for markets with
    demanding communications security requirements, utilizing
    security algorithms that meet a wide range of applications

and/or

country needs to address unique privacy requirements of
    customers (whether a government agency or supplier or a
    commercial manufacturer) and providing NSA-certified products
    and systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems. Our
    Sierra

tm

II cryptographic subsystem is a miniaturized programmable module
    that can be integrated into radios and other voice and data
    communications devices to encrypt classified information prior
    to transmission and storage. Our encryption modules currently
    meet or exceed the highest security standards established by the
    U.S. Government. Sierra II can be used for tactical
    radios, wireless local area networks (“WLANs”), remote
    sensors, guided munitions and UAVs. We also offer the
    Citadel

®

cryptographic engine, which provides military-grade,
    Type IV encryption, enabling low-cost, exportable
    encryption for our family of Falcon II radios. Our secure
    WLAN (“SWLAN”) solution, SecNet

®

Plus, is certified by the NSA’s Commercial COMSEC
    Endorsement Program (“CCEP”) and enables military and
    government users to communicate multimedia information,
    including data, voice and video, through a secure wireless
    network at 11 megabits per second. Our SecNet

tm

family of IP communications encryption products, designed to
    keep data, voice and video communications secure, is comprised
    of a modular architecture that includes a cryptographic module
    that provides all security-critical functions and companion
    modules that provide both wired and wireless communications of
    encrypted data over specific protocols. In fiscal 2007, we
    received Type 1 certification from the NSA for the SecNet 54
    SWLAN product line, which enables very high data rate
    transmission of sensitive defense communications over wireless
    infrastructures in applications such as tactical operations
    centers. In fiscal 2008, we received certification of the SecNet
    54 Ethernet module (“EMOD”) which enables secure
    transmission of sensitive communications over wired Ethernet
    connections.

We also provide unmanned ground sensor systems, which are a
    force-multiplier solution with a network of easily deployable,
    remotely located products that detect movement of personnel and
    vehicles. Our Falcon
    Watch

tm

remote intrusion detection and surveillance systems are fully
    integrated with our Falcon radios and are designed for
    surveillance and monitoring of high-value assets such as troop
    encampments, airfields, base installations, supply routes and
    depots. In larger networks these systems also can be used to
    monitor and protect national borders, regional boundaries and
    assets in homeland defense and peacekeeping operations. These
    sensor systems can be comprised of remote, battery-operated,
    wireless sensors using seismic, magnetic

and/or

passive infra-red detectors; relays; Falcon tactical radios; and
    sensor management application software.

Global market demand for our advanced tactical radio solutions
    continued to increase at strong growth rates in fiscal 2008,
    driving positive results for this segment. Deployment of
    advanced communications capabilities continues to be a top
    priority in the U.S. and globally, driven by modernization
    programs, force expansion, force restructuring and modularity,
    interoperability required in the growing number of NATO-led
    peacekeeping and disaster-relief missions, and the increasing
    desire for network-centric communications that will
    significantly improve situational awareness and force
    effectiveness through communications superiority. In fiscal
    2008, we responded to requirements for our Falcon family of
    radios from a broad base of U.S. Government customers,
    including the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force.
    Internationally, our radios are the standard of NATO and
    Partnership for Peace countries. In fiscal 2008, we received
    orders from,

and/or

made
    deliveries to, a wide range of international customers in
    countries including Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Brunei, Bulgaria,
    Chad, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Iraq, Jamaica,
    Kazakhstan, Kenya, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines,
    the Republic of Niger, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain,
    Tajikistan, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and the United
    Kingdom.

In May 2007, we were awarded an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite
    Quantity (“IDIQ”) contract with a maximum value of
    $422 million from the U.S. Army for Falcon II
    high-frequency manpack tactical radios and related vehicular and
    base station systems. We received an initial $104 million
    order against the contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
    In June 2007, we were awarded the Consolidated Interim Single
    Channel Handheld Radio (“CISCHR”) IDIQ contract by the
    JTRS JPEO to supply the U.S. Department of Defense
    (“DoD”) with JTRS-approved Falcon III multiband
    handheld tactical radios and vehicular systems. The CISCHR
    contract has a one-year maximum value of $2.7 billion and a
    five-year maximum value of approximately $7 billion
    (including additional options that may be exercised over a
    five-year period). Under the CISCHR contract, orders are awarded
    based on competitive bidding between us and another supplier,
    and we received orders under the CISCHR contract in fiscal 2008
    for the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force. In fiscal 2008, we
    also received orders under the $212 million Tactical
    Handheld Radio (“THHR”) IDIQ contract awarded in July
    2007 by the U.S. Marine Corps to support MRAP and other
    tactical vehicles. In June 2008, we were awarded
    $118 million in orders to supply the U.S. Marine Corps
    with Falcon II multiband manpack radios under a new
    $350 million IDIQ contract that is part of the Marine



Corps’ Strategic Radio Plan, which will transition the
    Marine Corps from legacy single-band radios to multiband,
    multimission software-defined radios.

Defense Programs:

We develop, supply and
    integrate communications and information processing products,
    systems and networks for diverse aerospace, terrestrial and
    maritime applications, in support of the ongoing transformation
    of communications for U.S. and international customers to
    network-centric architectures that support real-time situational
    awareness in combat conditions. Our technologies are providing
    advanced battlespace networking capabilities to assure timely
    and secure network-centric capabilities across strategic,
    operational and tactical boundaries in support of the DoD’s
    full spectrum of war fighting, intelligence and business
    missions. Our major technology areas include satellite
    communications terminals for mobile ground, fixed-site and
    shipboard applications; large, deployable satellite antenna
    reflectors; flat-panel, phased-array and single-mission
    antennas; aviation electronics for military jets and
    helicopters, including radios, digital maps, modems, sensors,
    data buses, fiber optics and microelectronics; and high-speed
    data links and data networks for wireless communications and
    smart weapons. For example, our high-speed digital Common Data
    Link (“CDL”) system called Hawklink, which is designed
    for the U.S. Navy’s Light Airborne Multi-Purpose
    System (“LAMPS”) helicopters, transmits tactical
    video, radar, acoustic and other sensor data from the
    helicopters to their host surface ships at distances greater
    than 100 nautical miles and at data rates exceeding 21 megabits
    per second.

We also provide high-speed secure wireless network solutions and
    phased-array capabilities for wireless transmission systems and
    are developing network-centric communications system
    architectures and technologies that will link sensors,
    platforms, weapons and soldiers using open architectures and
    mobile ad hoc networking capabilities. Our mobile ad hoc
    networking capability allows the military to take its
    communications infrastructure with it, creating mobile,
    self-forming and self-healing communications links across the
    battlefield. For example, our Highband Networking Radio
    (“HNR”), released in fiscal 2007, provides the
    military with fully mobile, wireless, long-range, high-bandwidth
    communications on-the-move by establishing line-of-sight
    connectivity between users of widely dispersed local area
    networks (“LANs”) using a Harris-developed waveform
    that automatically selects the best communications path
    available.

Major ongoing previously awarded programs include the F-35 Joint
    Strike Fighter, F-22 Raptor and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft
    platform programs, for which we provide high-performance,
    advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber optic networking and
    switching, intra-flight data links, image processing, digital
    map software and other electronic components; the Warfighter
    Information Network-Tactical (“WIN-T”) program for the
    U.S. Army, for which we are designing and testing the
    wireless transmission system architecture, applying our proven
    enabling technologies for wireless on-the-move communications,
    including phased arrays and high-speed secure wireless network
    solutions; the JTRS Ground Mobile Radio (“GMR”)
    program, for which we design, test and integrate the crypto
    subsystem, ground vehicle adaptor, ground vehicle adaptor mount,
    high-frequency power amplifier and high-frequency coupler; the
    Multifunctional Information Distribution System
    (“MIDS”) terminals program for DoD aircraft, which
    provides U.S. military forces with secure, jam-resistant,
    digital tactical communications; the Multiple Launch Rocket
    System (“MLRS”) Improved Fire Control System
    (“IFCS”) program for the U.S. Army, for which we
    provide the launcher interface unit, power switching unit and
    weapon interface unit; the Large Aperture Multiband Deployable
    Antenna (“LAMDA”) program, for which we provide
    rugged, highly-mobile, user-friendly,

large-aperture

tactical antennas supporting tri-band operations by utilizing
    interchangeable antenna feeds that can be rapidly installed by
    operators in the field; the CDL Hawklink program for
    U.S. Navy LAMPS helicopters, for which we are performing
    pre-production and testing of the Ku-band tactical CDL; the
    Multiband Shipboard Satellite Communications Terminal
    (“MSSCT”) program for the U.S. Navy, for which we
    are providing wideband satellite communications terminal
    systems; the Global Positioning System Next Generation Ground
    Control Segment (“OCX”) program, for which we provide
    design and engineering services for hardware, software and
    network infrastructure, including advanced ground antennas,
    advanced monitoring stations and interfaces to existing ground
    antennas; and the Lightweight Multiband Satellite Terminal
    (“LMST”) program for the U.S. Marine Corps, for
    which we provide mobile satellite communications terminals.

Significant new contract awards during fiscal 2008 included a
    five-year IDIQ contract, potentially worth $85 million, for
    the U.S. Navy’s Commercial Broadband Satellite Program
    (“CBSP”) Force Level Variant, for which we
    supply, for aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships,
    broadband multiband satellite communications terminals that
    support essential mission requirements and provide high-speed
    Internet access for as many as 5,000 military personnel onboard
    each aircraft carrier; and a five-year IDIQ contract,
    potentially worth $77 million, for the
    U.S. Navy’s CBSP Unit Level Variant, for which we
    supply, for frigates, cruisers and destroyers, broadband
    multiband satellite communications terminals that provide
    enhanced morale-related communications services such as
    high-speed Internet access and video communications.

Government
    Communications Systems

In fiscal 2008, Government Communications Systems was comprised
    of our Civil Programs, National Intelligence Programs and IT
    Services businesses.

Civil Programs:

Serving primarily
    U.S. Government civilian agencies, including the Federal
    Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Census Bureau,
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (“NOAA”), Department of Homeland Security
    (“DHS”) and Government Printing Office
    (“GPO”), we use our ability to implement and manage
    large, complex programs that integrate secure, advanced
    communications and information processing technologies in order
    to provide precise, highly reliable, secure high-speed
    communications and information networks that improve
    productivity and information processing for our customers. Our
    networks and information systems for large-scale,
    geographically-dispersed enterprises offer advanced capabilities
    for collecting, processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying,
    distributing, storing and retrieving data. Our custom networks,
    systems and solutions include meteorological data processing
    systems; electronic archival systems; graphic information
    systems; telecommunications services systems; maritime
    communications systems, including worldwide turnkey broadband
    satellite and terrestrial network systems and managed services
    for the maritime community, remote land-based installations and
    autonomous (buoy) systems; and healthcare IT enterprise
    intelligence solutions and services, including systems
    integration and collaboration, intelligent infrastructure,
    advanced visualization and display, and enterprise digital
    content management.

For example, we are the prime contractor on the 15-year,
    $2.2 billion contract for the FAA Telecommunications
    Infrastructure (“FTI”) program to integrate and
    modernize the U.S. air traffic control system and
    infrastructure. FTI is a modern, secure and efficient network
    that is providing voice, data and radar communications to 50,000
    FAA employees at more than 4,000 FAA sites across the U.S.,
    while reducing operating costs, enhancing network efficiency,
    reliability and security and improving service. We designed and
    deployed the new FTI network, have successfully transitioned
    more than 90 percent of the FAA’s legacy networks to
    the new FTI network, and are providing on-going mission
    operations and support services. We are also working with the
    FAA on other programs, including the Voice Switching and Control
    System (“VSCS”) program that allows air traffic
    controllers to establish critical ground-to-air and
    ground-to-ground communications links with pilots and other air
    traffic controllers, respectively; the Weather and Radar
    Processor (“WARP”) program that provides air traffic
    controllers with high-resolution graphical displays of
    integrated real-time next generation weather radar data; and the
    Operational and Supportability Implementation System
    (“OASIS”) program that provides integrated real-time
    weather and flight planning data for preflight weather briefings
    and in-flight updates.



We are also the prime contractor to the U.S. Census Bureau
    on two of its major programs. Under the Master Address
    File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
    Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project (“MTAIP”), we
    have modernized two key census databases containing
    175 million addresses for all U.S. residences and
    businesses and a database linking U.S. streets, rivers,
    railroads and other geographic features to Global Positioning
    System (“GPS”) coordinates. For the Field Data
    Collection Automation (“FDCA”) program awarded to us
    during fiscal 2006, we are integrating multiple automated
    systems and have developed a new wireless handheld device with
    integrated GPS and secure communication capabilities that
    together are designed to enable census takers to input data in
    real time and securely transmit the information back to the
    Census Bureau in support of the 2010 census.

We are also working with the GPO on its digital catalog database
    conversion project to develop its Federal Digital System, an IT
    system in which content — text, graphics, video, audio
    and other formats — will be entered, authenticated,
    and catalogued according to GPO-selected metadata and standards,
    in order to digitally preserve and make publicly accessible in a
    one-stop online site a vast quantity of Federal documents and
    information from all three branches of the U.S. Government.

In a new market for us — healthcare IT
    solutions — the Department of Health and Human
    Services (“HHS”) awarded us a $6 million contract
    in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 to develop and integrate an
    open-source National Health Information Exchange Gateway
    solution that will enable Federal healthcare agencies and
    healthcare providers to share patient information more quickly
    and easily, improving the quality of care and reducing costs. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we were selected for award of
    a seven-year contract, potentially worth $58 million, to provide
    the communications/navigation system for the next-generation
    space suit supporting the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (“NASA”) Constellation program.

National Intelligence Programs:

A significant
    portion of this business involves classified programs. While
    classified programs generally are not discussed in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our consolidated financial statements. We believe
    that the business risks associated with such programs do not
    differ materially from those of other U.S. Government
    programs.

Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency
    customers, including NSA, the National Reconnaissance Office
    (“NRO”) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence
    Agency (“NGA”), we provide integrated intelligence,
    surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”) solutions that
    improve situational awareness, data collection accuracy and
    product analysis by correlating near real-time mission data and
    intelligence reference data for display and analysis by
    strategic and tactical planners and decision makers. Our ISR
    systems help to integrate information across the analyst
    workflow, accelerating the movement of information that has been
    collected and processed. We strive to produce innovative and
    cost-effective ISR solutions that provide our customers with
    information dominance for battle-space superiority.

For example, our image processing capabilities extend from
    algorithm development through delivery of operations systems,
    and we are providing advanced image exploitation and
    dissemination solutions for ISR applications by advancing image
    processing, image data fusion, display technologies and digital
    product generation techniques. These technologies range from new
    techniques for merging and displaying imagery to automated
    techniques for image screening, cueing and remote visualization.
    Also, our mapping and visualization capabilities provide
    complete, accurate and timely knowledge about the threat, the
    terrain, the status and the location of single or multiple foe
    and friendly forces and their support by utilizing data,
    pictures, voice and video drawn from vast storage banks or from
    real-time input which can be transmitted around the world in
    fractions of a second. In addition, we have industry-leading
    capabilities in the architecture, design and development of
    highly-specialized satellite antennas, structures, phased arrays
    and on-board processors, which are used to enable
    next-generation satellite systems to provide the
    U.S. military and intelligence communities with strategic
    and tactical advantage. We are also a leader in the design and
    development of antenna and reflector technologies for commercial
    space telecommunications applications. Further, our wireless
    products capabilities include developing and supplying

state-of-the-art

wireless surveillance and tracking equipment to the U.S.
    Government and law enforcement communities for vehicular,
    man-portable, airborne, remote/unattended and system-level
    solutions for both passive and active missions.

During fiscal 2008, we were awarded several new classified
    programs and follow-on contracts. During fiscal 2008, we also
    were awarded several non-classified contracts. We were awarded a
    two-year contract in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 to provide
    satellite reflector antennas for the Sirius Satellite Radio FM 6
    satellite expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of
    calendar 2010. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we were
    awarded a ten-year contract (one base year with nine option
    years) valued at more than $40 million to supply support
    and engineering services for multiple space-related ground
    systems for a U.S. Air Force base. Ongoing previously
    awarded programs



include a contract with Space Systems/Loral to design and
    construct unfurlable mesh reflectors for commercial satellites;
    a contract to develop mission management software for security
    analysts; and a contract under the Global Geospatial
    Intelligence program to provide imagery intelligence and
    photogrammetry, mapping and charting information, and
    three-dimensional high-resolution image models of harbors,
    cities, airfields and other terrain.

IT Services:

We provide IT and communications
    services, products, enterprise solutions and advanced systems to
    U.S. Government defense, intelligence, homeland security
    and civil customers; state and local governments; and healthcare
    organizations and institutions. We significantly expanded our IT
    Services business area through our acquisition of Multimax
    Incorporated (“Multimax”) in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, broadening our customer base and providing new
    growth opportunities through Multimax’s key positions on
    major contracts such as the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet
    (“NMCI”) program and certain Government-Wide
    Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”), including Network
    Centric Solutions (“NETCENTS”), EAGLE, ITES-2S and
    FirstSource, which are IT procurement vehicles broadly
    accessible to U.S. Government agencies. With approximately
    3,000 professionals currently operating at locations worldwide,
    we support large-scale, mission-critical networks with technical
    expertise and strong customer commitment through the full
    technology lifecycle, including network design, deployment,
    operations and ongoing support. Our services include IT
    outsourcing (data entry, network administration, system
    operations and maintenance, and procurement and logistics
    support); enterprise management (systems engineering and
    integration, network design, capacity expansions and information
    assurance and security); and enterprise-wide IT planning and
    architecture services. We also offer customized IT support,
    operations and management services that reflect rigorous
    service-level requirements and performance-based incentives and
    disincentives, allowing public-sector organizations to focus on
    their core mission responsibilities while maximizing the return
    on their IT and communications infrastructure investments. In
    addition, we develop products and technologies that support
    advanced, network-centric communications, including the
    OS/COMET

®

satellite telemetry tracking and control software that is the
    command and control product of choice for
    Iridium

®

,
    GPS, multiple government geosynchronous (“GEO”) and
    Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellites.

As examples, we are a Tier One subcontractor on the NMCI
    program, the largest IT outsourcing contract ever issued by the
    U.S. Government, which will eventually provide voice, data
    and video communications to more than 500,000 Navy and Marine
    Corps users. We provide operations, maintenance and support
    services for NRO’s global communications and information
    systems network (the “Patriot” program) in space and
    on the ground under a ten-year contract, potentially worth
    $1 billion, in support of NRO’s global analyst
    community. We provide technical support services and IT systems
    and service modernization in support of more than 230
    U.S. embassies and consulates around the world under a
    contract awarded by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of
    Consular Affairs (the “State 6” program). We provide
    system maintenance and engineering for the Defense Information
    Systems Agency’s (“DISA”) Crisis Management
    System, and we staff the U.S. Postal Service Maintenance
    Technical Support Center in Oklahoma. We are also making it
    easier for DHS to purchase IT products through the FirstSource
    GWAC vehicle.

Additionally, we operate and maintain the communications
    functions for the U.S. Air Force

th

Space
    Wing’s Satellite Control Network (“AFSCN”), a
    global, continuously operational network of ground stations,
    operational control nodes and communications links that support
    launch and command and control of various space programs managed
    by the DoD and other national security space organizations. The
    AFSCN is responsible for providing readiness, launch, early
    orbit/on-orbit support, and anomaly resolution for a variety of
    military satellite constellations, including more than 140
    deployed satellites and other space vehicles such as ballistic
    missiles and the space shuttle. In calendar 2000, we were
    awarded a contract under the Operational Space Services and
    Support (“OSSS”) program, for which we have been
    providing operations, maintenance and support services to the
    AFSCN and GPS ground networks, including organizational level
    maintenance at all ground stations assigned to the AFSCN and GPS
    networks. In calendar 2002, we were awarded a contract under the
    Mission Communications Operations and Maintenance
    (“MCOM”) program, for which we have been providing
    operations and maintenance services for the AFSCN’s
    communications functions at Schriever AFB in Colorado and
    Onizuka AFS in California. In January 2008, we were awarded a
    6.5-year contract, which could be worth as much as
    $410 million, under the Network and Space Operations and
    Maintenance (“NSOM”) program with the U.S. Air
    Force

th

Space
    Wing in Colorado Springs to provide operations and maintenance
    support to the AFSCN at locations around the world. The NSOM
    program includes a majority of the OSSS and MCOM programs and
    supersedes those programs.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we were among a number
    of companies awarded the five-year ALLIANT GWAC by the General
    Services Administration (“GSA”), which allows us to
    provide integrated IT product and service solutions to support a
    number of U.S. Government agencies. We received a
    six-month, $22 million follow-on order in the third quarter
    of fiscal 2008 from the Department of State to modernize IT
    architecture for the Bureau of Consular Affairs. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, we were awarded a three-year,



$20 million IT services contract for a next-generation
    Tactical Video Capture System (“TVCS”) that will
    support training at various U.S. Marine Corps locations
    across the U.S. and abroad, and we were also awarded our
    second contract for healthcare IT solutions, a new market for
    us. This is a $12 million contract for the U.S. Army
    Dental Command Information Management & Technology
    Division, for which we will provide local operations and support
    to the U.S. Army Dental Command at Ft. Sam Houston,
    Texas and other Army dental clinics at locations around the
    world.

Revenue and Backlog:

Revenue for the
    Government Communications Systems segment increased
    32 percent to $2,000 million in fiscal 2008 compared
    with $1,513 million in fiscal 2007, and was
    $1,328 million in fiscal 2006. Segment operating income
    increased 7 percent to $149.8 million in fiscal 2008
    compared with $140.0 million in fiscal 2007, and was
    $141.4 million in fiscal 2006. This segment contributed
    38 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 compared
    with 36 percent in fiscal 2007 and 38 percent in
    fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2008, approximately 12 percent of
    the revenue for this segment was under contracts with prime
    contractors and approximately 88 percent was under direct
    contracts with customers, compared with approximately
    19 percent of revenue under contracts with prime
    contractors and approximately 81 percent of revenue under
    direct contracts with customers in fiscal 2007. Some of this
    segment’s more significant programs in fiscal 2008 included
    the FTI program, the FDCA program, the Patriot program, the
    NETCENTS program, the NMCI program and various classified
    programs. The largest program by revenue represented
    approximately 11 percent of this segment’s revenue in
    fiscal 2008, compared with approximately 16 percent in
    fiscal 2007. The 10 largest programs by revenue represented
    approximately 55 percent of this segment’s revenue in
    fiscal 2008, approximately 50 percent in fiscal 2007 and
    approximately 46 percent in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2008,
    this segment had a diverse portfolio of over 250 programs.
    Historically, this diversity has provided a stable backlog and
    reduced potential risks that come from reductions in funding or
    changes in customer priorities. In fiscal 2008,
    U.S. Government customers, whether directly or through
    prime contractors, accounted for approximately 96 percent
    of this segment’s total revenue compared with approximately
    93 percent in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, with the FAA
    accounting for 15 percent of this segment’s fiscal
    2008 revenue. For a general description of our
    U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a

    “DAB” and “DRM”. The rollout of HD Radio in
    the U.S. continues to progress with approximately 1,700
    stations currently on-air with HD Radio. Radio transmission
    products include the
    FLEXSTAR

tm

family, which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so
    broadcasters can offer supplemental audio



and data capability along with the main program stream. This
    enables broadcasters to develop new revenue-generating
    opportunities, including multiple programs on the same channel,
    5.1 surround sound, on-demand traffic, weather and sports
    reports, store-and-play capabilities and real-time navigation.

Revenue and Backlog:

Revenue for the Broadcast
    Communications segment increased 7 percent to
    $643 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $600 million

    $22.8 million in fiscal 2006. The Broadcast Communications
    segment contributed 12 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2008 compared with 14 percent in fiscal 2007 and
    15 percent in fiscal 2006. The percentage of this
    segment’s revenue that was derived outside of the United
    States was approximately 47 percent in fiscal 2008 compared
    with 46 percent in fiscal 2007 and 41 percent in
    fiscal 2006. Principal customers for Broadcast
    Communications’ products and services include domestic and
    international television and radio broadcast stations; cable and
    satellite networks and service providers; telecommunications
    providers; Federal agencies; public safety entities; advertising
    agencies; and content originators. No single customer accounted
    for more than 2 percent of fiscal 2008 revenue for the
    Broadcast Communications segment.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through

Harris
    Stratex Networks

In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we combined our former
    Microwave Communications Division with Stratex, a
    publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless transmission
    systems, to form Harris Stratex Networks. Harris Stratex
    Networks, our majority-owned, publicly-traded subsidiary listed
    on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “HSTX,”
    is a global communications solutions company offering end-to-end
    wireless transmission solutions for mobile and fixed-wireless
    service providers and private networks. As of June 27,
    2008, we owned approximately 56 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock. Following the combination, our
    business segment formerly referred to as Microwave
    Communications is now referred to as Harris Stratex Networks and
    includes the results of the combined business for periods
    following the combination.

Harris Stratex Networks is a global independent supplier of
    turnkey wireless transmission network solutions. It offers
    reliable, flexible, scalable and cost-efficient wireless
    transmission network solutions, including microwave radio
    systems and network management software, which are backed by

    backbone in developing nations, where microwave radio
    installations provide 21st-century communications rapidly and
    economically. Rural communities, areas with rugged terrain and
    regions with extreme temperatures benefit from the ability to
    build an advanced, affordable communications infrastructure
    despite these challenges.



Network Operations:

Harris Stratex Networks
    serves the network operations market by offering a wide range of
    software-based network management solutions for network
    operators worldwide, from element management to turnkey,
    end-to-end network management and service assurance solutions
    for virtually any type of communications or information
    network — including broadband, wireline, wireless and
    converged networks. Harris Stratex Networks develops, designs,
    produces, sells and services network management systems,
    including the
    NetBoss

®

product line, for these applications.

In general, wireless transmission networks are constructed using
    microwave radios and other equipment to connect cell sites,
    switching systems, land mobile radio systems, wireline
    transmission systems and other fixed-access facilities and other
    communications systems. Wireless networks range in size from a
    single transmission link connecting two buildings to complex
    networks comprised of thousands of wireless connections. The
    architecture of a network is influenced by several factors,
    including the available radio frequency spectrum, coordination
    of frequencies with existing infrastructure, application
    requirements, environmental factors and local geography. For
    many applications, microwave systems offer a lower-cost,
    highly-reliable and more easily deployable alternative to
    competing wireline transmission media, such as fiber, copper or
    coaxial cable.

Harris Stratex Networks’ principal product families of
    licensed point-to-point microwave radios include
    Eclipse

tm

,
    an

IP-enabled

platform for nodal wireless transmission systems, and
    TRuepoint

®

,
    a platform for high-performance point-to-point wireless
    communications. The Eclipse product line combines wireless
    transmission functions with network processing node functions,
    including many functions that, for non-nodal products, would
    have to be purchased separately. System functions include voice,
    data and video transport, node management, multiplexing, routing
    and cross-connection. Eclipse is designed to simplify complex
    networks and lower the total cost of ownership over the product
    life. With frequency coverage from 5 to 38 gigahertz,
    low-to-high capacity operation and traditional time-division
    multiplexing and Ethernet transmission capabilities, Eclipse is
    designed to support a wide range of long- and short-haul
    applications. Eclipse is software-configurable, enabling easy
    capacity upgrades, and gives users the ability to plan and
    deploy networks and adapt to changing conditions at minimal cost
    and disruption. The TRuepoint product family offers full
    plug-and-play, software programmable microwave radio
    configuration. It delivers service from 4 to 180 megabits per
    second capacity at frequencies ranging from 6 to
    38 gigahertz. TRuepoint is designed to meet the current and
    future needs of network operators, including mobile, private
    network, government and access service providers. The unique
    architecture of the core platform reduces both capital
    expenditures and life cycle costs, while meeting international
    and North American standards. The software-based architecture
    enables migration from traditional microwave access applications
    to higher-capacity transport interconnections. Harris Stratex
    Networks also offers license-exempt, point-to-point microwave
    radio product families.

Harris Stratex Networks’ network management product
    families, including NetBoss, offer a broad set of choices for
    all levels of network management, from enterprise-wide
    management and service assurance to element management. NetBoss
    is a family of network management and service assurance
    solutions for managing multi-vendor, multi-technology
    communications networks. NetBoss supports wireless and wireline
    networks of many types, offering fault management, performance
    management, service activation and assurance, billing mediation
    and operational support system integration. As a modular,
    off-the-shelf product, it enables customers to implement
    management systems immediately or gradually, as their needs
    dictate. NetBoss XE offers advanced element management. NetBoss
    products are optimized to work seamlessly with Harris Stratex
    Networks digital microwave radios, such as the TRuepoint family,
    but can also be customized to manage products based on any
    network or computing technology.

Revenue and Backlog:

Revenue for the Harris
    Stratex Networks segment increased 41 percent to
    $718 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $508 million
    in fiscal 2007, and was $349 million in fiscal 2006. This
    segment had an operating loss of $28.5 million in fiscal
    2008 compared with operating income of $146.9 million in
    fiscal 2007 and an operating loss of $19.6 million in
    fiscal 2006. This segment contributed 14 percent of our
    total revenue in fiscal 2008 compared with 12 percent in
    fiscal 2007 and 10 percent in fiscal 2006. This segment had
    revenue from a single external customer that exceeded
    10 percent of this segment’s total revenue during each
    of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006, but not during fiscal 2007. The
    percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived
    outside of the United States was approximately 73 percent
    in fiscal 2008 compared with 66 percent in fiscal 2007 and
    57 percent in fiscal 2006.

This segment generally sells its North American products and
    services directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. In international
    markets, this segment markets and sells its products and
    services through regional sales offices and established
    distribution channels, using agents and distributors. See
    “Item 1. Business — International
    Business” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $412 million at July 25, 2008 compared with
    $232 million at July 27, 2007 and $164 million at
    July 28, 2006. Harris Stratex Networks expects to fill
    substantially all of this backlog during fiscal 2009, but we can
    give no assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, see “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

International
    Business

Revenue from products exported from the United States (including
    foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad was
    $1,283.7 million (24 percent of our total revenue) in
    fiscal 2008 compared with $964.4 million (23 percent
    of our total revenue) in fiscal 2007 and $746.5 million
    (21 percent of our total revenue) in fiscal 2006. Our
    international sales include both direct exports from the United
    States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Most of the
    international sales are derived from the Harris Stratex
    Networks, Defense Communications and Electronics and Broadcast
    Communications segments. Direct export sales are primarily
    denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from foreign
    subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of
    the subsidiary. Exports from the United States, principally to
    Europe, Africa, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia,
    totaled $594.1 million (approximately 46 percent of
    our international revenue) in fiscal 2008 compared with
    $613.9 million (64 percent of our international
    revenue) in fiscal 2007 and $418.0 million (56 percent
    of our international revenue) in fiscal 2006. The percentage of
    revenue represented by foreign operations was 13 percent in
    fiscal 2008 compared with 8 percent in fiscal 2007 and
    9 percent in fiscal 2006. The percentage of long-lived
    assets represented by foreign operations was 26 percent as
    of June 27, 2008 compared with 28 percent as of
    June 29, 2007 and 24 percent as of June 30, 2006.
    Financial information regarding our domestic and international
    operations is contained in

Note 2


: Business
    Segments

in the Notes and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

Our principal international manufacturing facilities are located
    in Canada and the United Kingdom. The majority of our
    international marketing activities are conducted through
    subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
    America and Asia. We have also established international
    marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
    Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
    Registrant” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding our international subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
    distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
    sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
    and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
    for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the independent representative and may be above
    or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally
    receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those
    prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.
    Revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2008 represented
    7 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    28 percent of our international revenue, compared with
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2007 representing
    9 percent of our total revenue and 32 percent of our
    international revenue, and revenue from indirect sales channels
    in fiscal 2006 representing 6 percent of our total revenue
    and 23 percent of our international revenue.

Fiscal 2008 international revenue came from a large number of
    foreign countries, and no single country accounted for
    3 percent or more of our total revenue. Some of our exports
    are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried
    either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance
    payments, progress payments or other similar payments received
    prior to, or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs
    incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally
    require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to stay
    competitive in international markets, we also sometimes enter
    into recourse and vendor financing arrangements to facilitate
    sales to certain customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
    largely offset by the diversification of the international
    business and the protection provided by letters of credit and
    advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our



management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness; product
    quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service;
    past performance; ability to develop and implement complex,
    integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; and
    the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international
    markets. Within the IT services market, there is intense
    competition among many companies, and this market is generally
    more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract
    periods of shorter duration. The ability to compete in the IT
    services market depends on a number of factors, including the
    capability to deploy skilled professionals at competitive prices
    across the diverse spectrum of the IT services market.

In the Defense Communications and Electronics segment, principal
    competitors include BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, ITT
    Industries, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Northrop
    Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, Rohde & Schwarz,
    Tadiran and Thales.

In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal
    competitors include Accenture, BAE Systems, Boeing, Computer
    Sciences, General Dynamics, ITT Industries, L-3 Communications,
    Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins
    and SAIC.

Consolidation among U.S. defense and aerospace companies
    has resulted in a reduction in the number of principal prime
    contractors. As a result of this consolidation, in our Defense
    Communications and Electronics and Government Communications
    Systems segments we frequently “partner” or are
    involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
    companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
    programs.

In the Broadcast Communications segment, principal competitors
    include Avid, Broadcast Electronics, Chyron, Evertz, Harmonic,
    Microsystems, Miranda, Nautel, NEC, Omneon, Omnibus, Pilat
    Media, Rad Systems, Rohde & Schwarz, Sony Broadcast,
    Tandberg Television, Tektronix, Thomson/Grass Valley,
    Thomson/Thales, Vizrt and Wide Orbit, as well as other
    smaller companies and divisions of large companies. We believe
    that our broad product offering and total content delivery
    solutions are key competitive strengths for this segment.

In the Harris Stratex Networks segment, principal competitors
    include Ericsson, NEC, Alcatel-Lucent,

Nokia-Siemens,

Ceragon and Eltek-Nera, as well as other smaller companies.
    Several of this segment’s competitors are original
    equipment manufacturers or systems integrators through which the
    segment sometimes distributes and sells products and services to
    end-users. We believe that network and systems engineering
    support and service are key competitive strengths for this
    segment.

Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only customer
    accounting for 2 percent or more of our total revenue, were
    68 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 compared
    with 66 percent in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.
    Additional information regarding customers for each of our
    segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment for
    Fiscal 2008” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from
    contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the
    U.S. Government. Most of the sales of the Government
    Communications Systems segment and of the Defense Programs area
    of the Defense Communications and Electronics segment are made
    directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under
    contracts or subcontracts containing standard government
    contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if
    applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the
    U.S. Government or for default based upon performance.

These U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include
    both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of
    allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts fall into three basic types:
    (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for the
    payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of
    performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which
    provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified
    limits, based upon actual results compared with contractual
    targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and
    delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts,
    which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
    discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
    contractor against pre-established performance criteria. Under
    cost-reimbursement contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for
    allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on
    contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially
    or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or
    regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs,
    lobbying costs, charitable contributions and certain litigation
    defense costs.

Our fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts
    or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under firm fixed-price
    contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a
    fixed price and, as a result, benefit from



cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under
    fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the
    U.S. Government both savings accrued from contracts
    performed for less than target costs as well as costs incurred
    in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is
    higher than the target cost), but carry the entire burden of
    costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under
    such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down
    depending upon whether specified performance objectives are met.
    Under firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we
    usually receive either milestone payments equaling
    100 percent of the contract price or monthly progress
    payments from the U.S. Government in amounts equaling
    75 percent of costs incurred under the contract. The
    remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are
    billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and
    deliverables under the contract. Fixed-price contracts generally
    have higher profit margins than cost-reimbursement contracts.
    Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and
    development contracts are generally cost-reimbursement contracts.

In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, approximately
    35 percent, 33 percent and 38 percent,
    respectively, of the total combined revenue of our Defense
    Communications and Electronics and Government Communications
    Systems segments was from fixed-price contracts. GWAC and IDIQ
    contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type,
    require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for
    individual task or delivery orders under such contracts.

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for
    default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
    Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
    funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
    policies resulting from various military, political and
    international developments. Long-term government contracts and
    related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for
    subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under
    contracts terminable for the convenience of the
    U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
    payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
    proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
    Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
    the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
    and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
    of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
    In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
    complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
    difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
    developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
    many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
    facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD
    and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of
    risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report on

Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $6,300 million at July 25, 2008 compared
    with $5,871 million at July 27, 2007 and
    $5,641 million at July 28, 2006. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $2,011 million at
    July 25, 2008 compared with $1,724 million at
    July 27, 2007 and $1,482 million at July 28,
    2006. The determination of backlog involves substantial
    estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements
    contracts and development and production contracts of a
    cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products
    and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the
    case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. Unfunded
    backlog is primarily unfilled firm and expected follow-on orders
    that have not yet met our established funding criteria. Our
    established funding criteria require both authorization by the
    customer as well as our management’s determination that
    there is little or no risk of the authorized funding being
    rescinded. We do not include potential task or delivery orders
    under IDIQ contracts in our backlog. In fiscal 2009, we expect
    to fill approximately 86 percent of our total funded
    backlog as of July 25, 2008. However, we can give no
    assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will
    become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is
    subject to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are
    beyond our control. Additional information with regard to the
    backlog of each of our segments is provided under
    “Item 1. Business — Description of Business
    by Segment for Fiscal 2008” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $1,007 million in fiscal 2008,
    $924 million in fiscal 2007 and $824 million in fiscal
    2006. Company-sponsored research and product development costs,
    which included research and development for commercial products
    and independent research and development related to government
    products and services, as well as concept formulation studies
    and bid and proposal efforts, were approximately
    $275 million in fiscal 2008, $235 million in fiscal
    2007 and $198 million in fiscal 2006. A



portion of our independent research and development costs are
    allocated among contracts and programs in process under
    U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored
    research and product development costs not otherwise allocable
    are charged to expense when incurred. The portion of total
    research, development and engineering expenditures that was not
    company-sponsored was funded by the U.S. Government and is
    included in our revenue. Customer-sponsored research and
    development was $732 million in fiscal 2008,
    $689 million in fiscal 2007 and $626 million in fiscal
    2006. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development
    of new products and to building technological capability in
    selected communications and electronic systems markets.
    U.S. Government-funded research helps strengthen and
    broaden our technical capabilities. All of our segments maintain
    their own engineering and new product development departments,
    with scientific assistance provided by advanced-technology
    departments. As of June 27, 2008, we employed nearly 7,000
    engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts to make the
    technologies developed in any of our business segments available
    for all other business segments.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the
    aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large and
    valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how,
    confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other
    intellectual property. We also license intellectual property to
    and from third parties. As of June 27, 2008, we held
    approximately 1,020 U.S. patents and 800 foreign patents,
    and had approximately 580 U.S. patent applications
    pending and 1,240 foreign patent applications pending.
    Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also
    make an important contribution to our business. While our
    intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to
    our business and the operations of our business segments, we do
    not consider our business or any business segment to be
    materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other
    intellectual property right, or any group of related patents,
    licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged
    in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a
    number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which
    generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements
    have generated income in past years and may do so in the future,
    there can be no assurances we will enter into additional
    income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage
    in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual
    property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks,
    copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive
    advantages. With regard to patents relating to our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment or our Government
    Communications Systems segment, the U.S. Government often
    has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
    pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize
    others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant
    to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to
    our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.
    Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products
    are also considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic
    and international laws and regulations designed to protect the
    environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions.
    The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common
    within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve.
    We believe that we have complied with these requirements and
    that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Based upon currently-available information, we do not expect
    expenditures to protect the environment and to comply with
    current environmental laws and regulations over the next several
    years to have a material impact on our competitive or financial
    position, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures
    will not exceed current expectations. If future laws and
    regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently
    anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present
    estimates of those expenditures. We have installed waste
    treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy
    legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and
    prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
    environmental capital projects in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 or
    fiscal 2006. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates
    to discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
    environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
    be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
    material in fiscal 2009. These amounts may increase in future
    years. Additional information regarding environmental and
    regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in
    the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks
    segments, in particular, is subject to domestic and
    international requirements requiring end-of-life management

and/or

restricting materials in



products delivered to customers, including the European
    Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and Directive 2002/95/EC
    on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in
    Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”). Other
    jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation. Such
    requirements typically are not applicable to most equipment
    produced by our Defense Communications and Electronics and
    Government Communications Systems segments. We believe that we
    have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable,
    with respect to our existing products sold into such
    jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations with respect to our future products.

Broadcast and wireless communications (whether TV, radio or
    telecommunications) are also subject to governmental regulation.
    Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications and Harris
    Stratex Networks segments, in particular, is subject to domestic
    and international requirements to avoid interference among users
    of radio and television frequencies and to permit
    interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
    we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to
    our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules
    and regulations with respect to our future products.
    Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could
    impact our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Raw
    Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
    as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
    numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
    electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
    plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
    dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
    of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
    and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
    restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
    and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
    one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
    of a particular item or because of local content preference
    requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
    While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
    of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
    materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
    materials or products. In fiscal 2007, our Broadcast
    Communications segment experienced component shortages from
    vendors as a result of the new RoHS environmental regulations in
    the European Union, which became effective on July 1, 2006.
    These regulations caused a spike in demand for lead-free
    electronic components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain
    shortages. These component shortages did not have a material
    adverse effect on our business.

Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    U.S. Government budgets, supplemental budgets and contract
    awards, the availability of funding, product deliveries and
    customer acceptance.

Employees

We employed approximately 16,500 employees at the end of
    fiscal 2008 compared with approximately 16,000 employees at
    the end of fiscal 2007. Approximately 89 percent of our
    employees as of the end of fiscal 2008 are located in the United
    States. A significant number of employees in our Defense
    Communications and Electronics and Government Communications
    Systems segments possess a security clearance. We also utilize a
    number of independent contractors. None of our employees in the
    United States is represented by a labor union. In certain
    international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by
    workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we
    believe that our relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that
    could impact our business and future results in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, our business, operating results, cash flows and
    financial condition are subject to various risks and
    uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
    below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary
    materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.

We
    participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and
    expenditures.

We participate in markets that are subject to uncertain economic
    conditions. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level
    of growth in some of the markets in which we participate.
    Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are
    dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the
    uncertainty renders estimates of future income and expenditures
    even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant
    investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated
    benefits, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations. The future direction of the overall domestic and
    global economies also will have a significant impact on our
    overall performance.

We
    depend on the U.S. Government for a significant portion of our
    revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in U.S.
    Government funding could have adverse consequences on our future
    business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the U.S. Government.
    The percentage of our net revenue that was derived from sales to
    the U.S. Government was approximately 68 percent in
    fiscal 2008 and 66 percent in each of fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006. Therefore, any significant disruption or
    deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government
    would significantly reduce our revenue. Our U.S. Government
    programs must compete with programs managed by other government
    contractors for limited resources and for uncertain levels of
    funding. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to
    expand their business relationships with the
    U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
    future. The U.S. Government may choose to use other
    contractors for its limited number of programs. In addition, the
    funding of programs also competes with non-procurement spending
    of the U.S. Government. Budget decisions made by the
    U.S. Government are outside of our control and have
    long-term consequences for our business. A shift in
    U.S. Government spending to other programs in which we are
    not involved, an increase in non-procurement spending or a
    reduction in U.S. Government spending generally, could have
    material adverse consequences on our future business.

We
    depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts, which
    often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
    implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
    and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
    is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
    contracts may be planned or authorized in connection with major
    procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal
    year basis even though a program may continue for several years.
    Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
    initially, and additional funds are committed only as



Congress authorizes further appropriations. The termination of
    funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a
    loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program,
    which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In
    addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit
    additional funds to a program that already has been started
    could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of
    doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
    addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
    termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
    U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment only
    for work done and commitments made at the time of termination.
    We can give no assurance that one or more of our
    U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
    these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
    would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
    backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
    U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
    our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
    our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
    large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
    regulations and a variety of socio-economic and other
    requirements. These requirements, although customary in
    U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
    compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
    thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
    on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
    regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
    debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
    subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
    debarment are violations of various laws, including those
    related to procurement integrity, export control,
    U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
    protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper
    recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
    U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
    of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
    could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for
    future U.S. Government contracts.

We
    enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses
    in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in
    inflation.

We have a number of firm fixed-price contracts. In fiscal 2008
    and fiscal 2007, approximately 35 percent and
    33 percent, respectively, of the total combined revenue of
    our Defense Communications and Electronics and Government
    Communications Systems segments was from fixed-price contracts.
    These contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, but they
    carry the risk of potential cost overruns because we assume all
    of the cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we
    can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government
    contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the
    U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a
    project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of
    its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or
    foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of
    the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new
    technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen
    events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the
    price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost
    overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less
    favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Recently, the
    United States has experienced a significant increase in
    inflation. A continued significant increase in inflation rates
    could also have a significant adverse impact on the
    profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if we do not meet
    contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
    contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
    liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
    exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
    contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
    rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
    contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
    operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
    from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
    cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
    results. Furthermore, the potential impact of this risk on our
    financial results would be magnified by a shift in the mix of
    our contracts and programs toward a greater percentage of firm
    fixed-price contracts.

We
    derive a substantial portion of our revenue from international
    operations and are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
    States. In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, revenue
    from products exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad
    was 24 percent, 23 percent and 21 percent,
    respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
    54 percent of our international business in fiscal 2008 was
    transacted in local currency environments. Losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We
    expect that international revenue will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue.



Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is in
    less-developed countries. We are subject to risks of doing
    business internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using international dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

While these factors and the impacts of these factors are
    difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations in the future.

We may
    not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to
    conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent
    proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and
    authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before
    we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies
    outside of the United States. For example, the
    U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least

15-60 days,

depending on the size and location of the sale, prior to
    authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to
    foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action
    to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we
    will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary
    licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or
    delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability
    to sell products or technologies outside of the United States
    could negatively impact our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our
    future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized
    by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry
    standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a
    number of factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target
    markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors;

•

Develop, manufacture and bring cost-effective offerings to
    market quickly; and

•

Effectively structure our businesses, through the use of teaming
    agreements, ventures and other forms of alliances, to reflect
    the competitive environment.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
    we will need to continue to develop new products and
    technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial
    resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our
    attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be
    sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely
    development of new products or technologies. Due to the design
    complexity of some of our products and technologies, we may
    experience delays in completing development and introducing new
    products or technologies in the future. Any delays could result
    in increased costs of development or redirect resources from
    other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that
    the markets for our products or technologies will develop as we
    currently anticipate. The failure of our products or
    technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly
    reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot
    be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products
    or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our
    products or technologies, or that our competitors will not
    develop new products or technologies that cause our existing
    products or technologies to become obsolete. If we fail in our
    new product and technology development efforts, or our products
    or technologies fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly
    than those of our



competitors, our revenue will decline and our business,
    financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
    affected.

We
    cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events,
    but they may affect adversely the markets in which we operate,
    our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our
    profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11,
    2001, the subsequent

U.S.-led

military response, current conflicts in the Middle East and the
    potential for future terrorist activities and other recent
    geo-political events have created economic and political
    uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and the prices of our securities. These matters have
    caused uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance
    markets and may increase significantly the political, economic
    and social instability in the geographic areas in which we
    operate. These matters also have caused the premiums charged for
    our insurance coverages to increase and may cause some coverages
    to be unavailable altogether. While our government businesses
    have benefited from homeland defense initiatives and the Global
    War on Terror, these developments may affect adversely our
    business and profitability and the prices of our securities in
    ways that we cannot predict at this time.

We
    have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that
    involve significant risks and uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    strategic acquisitions do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

The
    inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers
    to timely deliver our components or parts, could cause our
    products to be produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory
    manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. In addition,
    there are certain parts or components for many of our products
    which we source from other manufacturers or vendors. Some of our
    suppliers, from time to time, experience financial and
    operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to
    supply the materials, components and subsystems that we require.
    Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a

cost-effective

and timely basis could materially impair our ability to
    manufacture and deliver products to our customers. We can give
    no assurances that we will be free from material supply problems
    or component or subsystems problems in the future. Also, our
    subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to maintain
    the quality of the materials, components and subsystems they
    supply, which might result in greater product returns and
    warranty claims and could harm our business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
    protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
    often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be
    infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon
    those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual
    property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
    royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to
    obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us,
    or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain of our
    products. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary
    technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions
    and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our
    intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully protect
    and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer.
    Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may
    not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or
    scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition,
    our patents may not provide us a significant competitive
    advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to
    monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not
    be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may
    be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design
    around our technology or develop competing technologies.



The
    outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is
    unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could
    have a material adverse affect on our financial position and
    results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are
    involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert
    financial and management resources that would otherwise be used
    to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the
    results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An
    adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a
    material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to customer credit risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term customer
    financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
    portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
    well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
    obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
    or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been able to
    place a portion of our customer financings with third-party
    lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this risk, a
    portion of these financings is provided directly by us. There
    can be higher risks associated with some of these financings,
    particularly when provided to

start-up

operations such as local network providers, to customers in
    developing countries or to customers in specific
    financing-intensive areas of the telecommunications industry. If
    customers fail to meet their obligations, losses could be
    incurred and such losses could have an adverse effect on us. Our
    losses could be much greater if it becomes more difficult to
    place or insure against these risks with third parties. These
    risks may increase when the availability of credit decreases.

We
    face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
    and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
    relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
    defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
    associated with these systems and products may be untested or
    unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
    products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
    satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control systems,
    homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
    to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
    circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
    risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
    to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
    substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
    possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
    risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
    incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
    insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for
    which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively
    affect our standing among our customers and the public, thereby
    making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
    could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
    insurance in the future.

Changes
    in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a
    number of factors including:

•

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax
    returns;

•

Increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including
    write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and
    impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;

•

Changes in available tax credits;

•

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the
    interpretation of such tax laws; and

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
    tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

Our
    consolidated financial results may be impacted by Harris Stratex
    Networks’ financial results, which may vary significantly
    and be difficult to forecast.

We consolidate Harris Stratex Networks’ financial results
    in our results of operations. Harris Stratex Networks’
    financial results may vary significantly in the future and may
    be affected by a number of factors (many of which are outside of
    our and Harris Stratex Networks’ control), and accordingly
    are expected to be difficult to forecast. Delays in product
    delivery or closing of a sale can cause quarterly revenues and
    quarterly net income to fluctuate significantly from anticipated
    levels. In addition, Harris Stratex Networks may increase
    spending in response to



competition or in pursuit of new market opportunities.
    Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that Harris Stratex
    Networks will be able to achieve profitability in the future or,
    if profitability is attained, that Harris Stratex Networks will
    be able to sustain profitability, particularly on a
    quarter-to-quarter basis.

Because we consolidate Harris Stratex Networks’ financial
    results in our results of operations, fluctuations in and
    difficulty in forecasting Harris Stratex Networks’
    financial results will result in fluctuations in and likely
    greater difficulty in forecasting our consolidated results of
    operations. As a result, such fluctuations and forecasting
    difficulty may impact our consolidated financial results.
    Additionally, we rely on Harris Stratex Networks to timely
    provide its financial information for us to use in preparing and
    filing with the SEC our consolidated financial statements.
    Delays or other difficulties in Harris Stratex Networks’
    ability to provide on a timely basis financial information that
    accurately reflects its financial results may result in delays
    or other difficulties in our ability to prepare and file with
    the SEC on a timely basis our consolidated financial statements
    that accurately reflect our consolidated results of operations.

We
    have significant operations in Florida, California and other
    locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the
    event of a natural disaster or other significant
    disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
    Government Communications Systems segment are located in
    Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. In addition, our
    Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments
    have locations near major earthquake fault lines in California.
    Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters
    or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes,
    typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages,
    other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of
    terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications
    failures, and other natural and manmade disasters or
    disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other
    disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to
    our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors,
    resellers or customers; destruction of facilities;

and/or

loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs
    and expenses and materially adversely affect our business,
    revenue and financial condition.

Changes
    in future business conditions could cause business investments
    and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in
    substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results
    of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately 34 percent of our recorded total assets as of
    June 27, 2008. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded
    goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential
    impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on
    several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in
    expected reporting segment cash flows or changes in market
    conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded
    goodwill. For additional information on accounting policies we
    have in place for goodwill impairment, see our discussion under
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in the
    Notes.

In
    order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm
    us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract significant
    numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding
    security clearances, to support our growth and to replace
    individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or
    for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified
    personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case in recent years,
    we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs
    in order to attract and retain such employees, or could
    experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our
    needs for such employees were unmet.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
    in Melbourne, Florida. As of June 27, 2008, we operated
    approximately 124 locations in the United States, Canada,
    Europe, Central and South America and Asia,



consisting of about 6.8 million square feet of
    manufacturing, administrative, research and development,
    warehousing, engineering and office space, of which
    approximately 4.4 million square feet are owned and
    approximately 2.4 million square feet are leased. There are
    no material encumbrances on any of our facilities. Our leased
    facilities are, for the most part, occupied under leases for
    remaining terms ranging from one month to 11 years, a
    majority of which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than
    five-year intervals at our option. As of June 27, 2008, we
    had major operations at the following locations:

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
    leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
    and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
    While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
    not considered significant. We continuously review our
    anticipated requirements for facilities and will, from time to
    time, acquire additional facilities, expand existing facilities,
    and dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof, as
    management deems necessary. For more information about our lease
    obligations, see

Note 18: Lease Commitments

in the
    Notes. Our facilities and other properties are generally
    maintained in good operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal
    incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are,
    and were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and
    litigation commenced by or against us arising from or related
    to: product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks,
    trade secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee
    disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
    products containing asbestos or other restricted materials;
    breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed amounts
    against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable
    relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any
    real risk of court or arbitral awards. We typically record
    accruals for losses related to those matters against us that we
    consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated.
    Gain contingencies, if any, typically are recognized when they
    are realized and legal costs generally are expensed when
    incurred. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of
    these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or
    proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us,
    based upon available information, in the opinion of management,
    settlements and final judgments, if any, which are considered
    probable of being rendered against us in litigation or
    arbitration in existence at June 27, 2008 are reserved
    against, covered by insurance or would not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.



U.S. Government
    Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such
    as us, are engaged in supplying goods and services to the
    U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore
    dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
    allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
    U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government contracts
    typically involve long lead times for design and development,
    are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
    may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the
    U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
    design and production of complex and technologically advanced
    products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government as either a prime
    contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes
    may arise between the prime contractor and the
    U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
    subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
    contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
    policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
    U.S. Government, and specific agency acquisition
    regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations. As a
    U.S. Government contractor, our contract costs are audited
    and reviewed on a continuing basis by the Defense Contract Audit
    Agency (“DCAA”). The DCAA also reviews the adequacy
    of, and a U.S. Government contractor’s compliance
    with, the contractor’s internal control systems and
    policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property,
    estimating, compensation and management information systems. In
    addition to these routine audits, from time to time, we may,
    either individually or in conjunction with other
    U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits and
    investigations by other agencies of the U.S. Government.
    These audits and investigations are conducted to determine if
    our performance and administration of our U.S. Government
    contracts are compliant with applicable contractual requirements
    and procurement and other applicable Federal laws and
    regulations. These investigations may be conducted without our
    knowledge. We are unable to predict the outcome of such
    investigations or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or
    other actions that could be instituted against us, our officers
    or employees. Under present U.S. Government procurement
    laws and regulations, if indicted or adjudged in violation of
    procurement or other Federal laws, a contractor, such as us, or
    one or more of our operating divisions or subdivisions, could be
    subject to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or
    treble damages. U.S. Government regulations also provide
    that certain findings against a contractor may lead to
    suspension or debarment from eligibility for awards of new
    U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension
    or debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because
    of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition,
    our export privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension
    or revocation of our export privileges also would have a
    material adverse effect on us.

International.

As an international company, we
    are, from time to time, the subject of investigations relating
    to our international operations, including under the
    U.S. export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous
    U.S. Federal, state and international environmental laws
    and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time
    in investigations or litigation of various potential
    environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or
    former facilities or remediation as a result of past activities
    (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From
    time to time, we receive notices from the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or
    international environmental agencies that we are a potentially
    responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”)

and/or

equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for
    cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us,
    sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances
    attributable to us from past operations. We own, previously
    owned or have been named as a potentially responsible party at
    17 such sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose
    no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally
    determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of
    many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our management, any
    payments we may be required to make as a result of such claims
    in existence at June 27, 2008 will not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows. Additional information regarding environmental
    matters is set forth in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

in the Notes, which Note is incorporated herein by
    reference.

    Information and Price Range of Common
    Stock

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), under
    the ticker symbol “HRS.” According to the records of
    our transfer agent, as of August 22, 2008, there were
    approximately 6,535 holders of record of our common stock. On
    February 25, 2005 our Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of our common stock. The stock split was
    effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
    distributed on March 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
    March 14, 2005. All share and per share amounts and
    information presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for periods prior to the stock split have been retroactively
    restated to reflect the effect of this stock split. The high and
    low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the NYSE
    composite transactions reporting system and the dividends paid
    on our common stock for each quarterly period in our last two

Dividends

The dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in our
    last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
    August 23, 2008, our Board of Directors increased our
    annual dividend rate from $.60 per share to $.80 per share
    and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.20 per share,
    which will be paid on September 17, 2008 to holders of
    record on September 4, 2008. Our annual common stock
    dividend rate was $.60 per share, $.44 per



share and $.32 per share in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006, respectively. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid
    in March, June, September and December. We have paid cash
    dividends every year since 1941, and we currently expect that
    cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but
    we can give no assurance. The declaration of dividends and the
    amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our
    financial condition, capital requirements, results of
    operations, future business prospects and other factors that our
    Board of Directors may deem relevant.

    OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    (“MD&A”) is intended to assist in an
    understanding of Harris. MD&A is provided as a supplement
    to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its

    or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
    to, those discussed below in MD&A under
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
    Future Results.”

The following is a list of the sections of MD&A, together
    with our perspective on the contents of these sections of
    MD&A, which we hope will make reading these pages more
    productive:

    Future Results

— cautionary information about
    forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks
    and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ

    expectations or projections.

BUSINESS
    CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
    technology company that applies a solutions approach to serving
    government and commercial markets in more than 150 countries.
    Our mission is to be the

best-in-class

global provider of mission critical

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets. Our
    company generates revenue, income and cash flows by developing,
    manufacturing and selling communications products and software
    as well as providing related services. We generally sell
    directly to our customers, the largest of which is the
    U.S. Government and its prime contractors. We also utilize
    agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and
    services, especially in international markets.

As discussed further in

Note 23:

Business
    Segments

in the Notes, effective for fiscal 2008 (which
    began June 30, 2007), our Defense Programs business (part
    of our Government Communications Systems segment for fiscal
    2007) was combined with our RF Communications business, and
    the combined business is reported as our Defense Communications
    and Electronics segment for fiscal 2008. Our Broadcast
    Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments did not
    change as a result of these adjustments to our organizational
    structure. The historical results, discussion and presentation
    of our business segments as set forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

reflect the impact of these adjustments to our organizational
    structure for all periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



We report our financial results for fiscal 2008 in the following
    four business segments:

•

Our Defense Communications and Electronics segment, which was
    comprised of our (i) RF Communications and
    (ii) Defense Programs businesses;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, which was
    comprised of our (i) Civil Programs, (ii) National
    Intelligence Programs and (iii) IT Services businesses;

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, which was comprised of our
    (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Television and Radio
    Transmission Systems businesses; and

•

Our Harris Stratex Networks segment (formerly Microwave
    Communications), which was comprised of our (i) North
    America Microwave, (ii) International Microwave and
    (iii) Network Operations businesses.

As described in greater detail in
    “Item 1.  Business — Description
    of Business by Segment for Fiscal 2008 — Harris
    Stratex Networks,” in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we
    combined our former Microwave Communications Division with
    Stratex, a publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless
    transmission systems, to form a new company named Harris Stratex
    Networks, Inc. As of June 27, 2008, we owned approximately
    56 percent of Harris Stratex Networks’ outstanding
    stock. Following the combination, our business segment formerly
    referred to as Microwave Communications is referred to as Harris
    Stratex Networks and reflects the results of the combined
    businesses for periods following the combination. Financial
    information with respect to all of our other activities,
    including corporate costs not allocated to the business
    segments, is reported as part of Headquarters Expense or
    Non-Operating Income (Loss).

On August 5, 2008, we announced that we would report our
    financial results for fiscal 2009 (which began June 28,
    2008) in the following four business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, which will be
    comprised of our (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National
    Intelligence Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and
    (iv) IT Services businesses;

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, which will be comprised of
    our (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Television and Radio
    Transmission Systems businesses; and

•

Our Harris Stratex Networks segment, which will be comprised of
    our (i) North America Microwave, (ii) International
    Microwave and (iii) Network Operations businesses.

Our segment reporting structure for fiscal 2009 reflects that
    our RF Communications business (part of our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment for fiscal
    2008) will be reported as its own separate segment for
    fiscal 2009, and that our Defense Programs business (the other
    part of our Defense Communications and Electronics segment for
    fiscal 2008) will be reported as part of our Government
    Communications Systems segment for fiscal 2009, together with
    that segment’s existing businesses (National Intelligence
    Programs, Civil Programs and IT Services). Our Broadcast
    Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments will not
    change as a result of the adjustments to our segment reporting
    structure. These adjustments to our segment reporting take
    effect in fiscal 2009 and therefore do not affect the historical
    results, discussion or presentation of our business segments as
    set forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We will begin to report our financial results consistent with
    this new segment reporting structure beginning with the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and we will conform our historical
    segment reporting accordingly.

Value
    Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for Achieving
    Value

We are committed to our mission statement, and we believe that
    executing our mission statement creates value. Consistent with
    this commitment to effective execution, we currently focus on
    these key value drivers:

•

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all segments by
    introducing new technology-based products, expanding addressable
    markets, developing new capabilities to attract new customers
    and new programs, and investing in international markets and
    channels;

•

Focusing on operating efficiencies and cost reductions by
    focusing on supply chain and operational excellence;

•

Leveraging various corporate initiatives across business
    segments;

•

Making strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolio and to gain access to new
    markets; and

•

Maintaining an efficient capital structure.



Continuing profitable revenue growth in all
    segments:

We plan to focus on continued
    profitable revenue growth by implementing the following
    strategies in each segment:

Defense Communications and
    Electronics:

Continue to leverage reputation and
    position as a leading provider of tactical radios offered by our
    RF Communications business in the areas of high-frequency
    (“HF”), multiband and cryptographic sub-systems; and
    expand market reach with new products such as the
    Falcon III JTRS-compliant multiband handheld, manpack and
    vehicular and secure personal radios as well as high-capacity
    line-of-site radios, COMSEC terminals, unmanned ground sensor
    products and international systems. Expand addressable markets
    such as avionics, electronics and data links; space and ground
    SATCOM systems, including antennas and space-hardened
    electronics; and defense communications and information
    networks. Leverage synergies across RF Communications and
    Defense Programs business units. Develop, promote and sell
    Defense Programs products and systems into certain global
    markets.

Government Communications Systems:

Expand
    capabilities based on strong national intelligence credentials
    core to national security and the Global War on Terror. Leverage
    core capabilities for expanded opportunities in civil markets.
    Utilize IT Services business scale to address the growing
    government and commercial service markets. Identify and
    implement growth initiatives in new markets.

Broadcast Communications:

Grow core business
    through aggressive new product introductions aimed at
    high-definition and digital-infrastructure build-outs, new
    channel additions, and expansion into new markets such as
    digital signage, government, news and sports. Focus on expanding
    profit and return on capital. Leverage interoperability
    initiative based on open industry standards by delivering
    high-value, highly reliable solutions. Drive a customer-centric
    culture, with strong strategic account management. Focus on
    geographic expansion in international growth markets. Leverage
    the Harris brand.

Harris Stratex Networks:

Continue to win
    opportunities with public telecommunications providers as well
    as Federal, state and other private network operators to meet
    increasing demand for capacity requirements and the demand for
    high-reliability, high-bandwidth networks that are more secure
    and better protected against natural and man-made disasters.
    Offer innovative new products and expand regional sales channels
    to capture greenfield network opportunities and penetrate major
    regional mobile telecom operators to participate in network
    opportunities. Offer a broad range of engineering and other
    professional services for network planning, systems architecture
    design and project management as a global competitive advantage.
    Expand our network operations offerings in microwave and
    non-microwave opportunities to create items that differentiate
    our total solutions offerings.

Focusing on operating efficiencies and cost
    reductions:

Our principal focus areas for
    operating efficiencies and cost management are: reducing
    procurement costs through an emphasis on coordinated supply
    chain management; reducing product costs through dedicated
    engineering resources focused on product design; improving
    manufacturing efficiencies across all segments; and optimizing
    facility utilization.

Leveraging various corporate initiatives across business
    segments:

One of our strengths is our ability
    to transfer technology among segments and focus our research and
    development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole.
    Another area of focus is cross-selling through segment sales
    channels and joint pursuits by multiple segments. Other
    corporate initiatives include joint international market channel
    development, such as shared distributors and coordinated
    “go-to-market” strategies.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another
    key value driver is effective capital allocation by making
    effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
    the strengths in our base businesses. We believe acquisitions
    may also serve to balance and enhance our portfolio of
    businesses. No material acquisitions were completed in fiscal
    2008. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we combined our
    Microwave Communications Division with Stratex to
    form Harris Stratex Networks, the largest independent
    provider of wireless transmission network solutions, of which we
    own 56 percent. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we
    acquired Multimax, a leading provider of information technology
    and network services for the U.S. Government, which is
    being operated as part of our Government Communications Systems
    segment. The acquisition of Multimax provided us greater scale,
    a broader customer base and new growth opportunities through key
    positions on GWACs. In recent years, we have also made several
    acquisitions in our Broadcast Communications segment including
    Encoda, Leitch, OSi, Aastra Digital Video and Zandar. These
    acquisitions helped us expand our product and service portfolio
    so we can offer end-to-end content delivery, transport and asset
    management solutions to our customers.

Maintaining an efficient capital
    structure:

Our capital structure is intended
    to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital
    position, access to key financial markets, ability to raise
    funds at a low effective cost and overall low cost of borrowing
    provide a competitive advantage. We had $373.1 million in
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of
    June 27, 2008 and had $550.3 million of cash flows
    provided by operating



activities during fiscal 2008. Our cash is not restricted and
    can be used to invest in capital expenditures, make strategic
    acquisitions, repurchase our common stock or pay dividends to
    our shareholders. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased
    $225 million in shares of our common stock under a
    $600 million share repurchase program approved by our Board
    of Directors during fiscal 2007, for a total of
    $425 million in shares of our common stock repurchased
    under this program since it was approved. While this program
    does not have a stated expiration date, we expect to repurchase
    during fiscal 2009 the remaining $175 million in shares of
    our common stock authorized to be repurchased under this
    program. We currently expect that these repurchases will more
    than offset the dilutive effect of shares to be issued under our
    share-based incentive plans.

Key
    Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
    key indicators of value such as: (1) net income and net
    income per diluted share, (2) revenue, (3) gross
    margin, (4) net income as a percentage of revenue,
    (5) operating cash flows, (6) return on average assets
    and (7) return on average equity. The measure of our
    success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity
    and capital resources key indicators:

Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations Key
    Indicators:

Net income, net income per
    diluted share, revenue, gross margin, and net income as a
    percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value
    drivers:

•

Net income decreased 7.5 percent from $480.4 million
    in fiscal 2007 (which included a $143.1 million after-tax
    gain on the combination with Stratex) to $444.2 million in
    fiscal 2008;

•

Net income per diluted share decreased 5.0 percent from
    $3.43 in fiscal 2007 (which included a $1.01 per diluted share

after-tax

gain on the combination with Stratex) to $3.26 in fiscal 2008;

•

Revenue increased 25.2 percent from $4.2 billion in
    fiscal 2007 to $5.3 billion in fiscal 2008;

•

Gross margin (revenue from product sales and services less cost
    of product sales and services) decreased from 32.3 percent
    of revenue in fiscal 2007 to 30.7 percent of revenue in
    fiscal 2008; and

•

Net income as a percentage of revenue decreased from
    11.3 percent in fiscal 2007 to 8.4 percent in fiscal
    2008.

for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key
    Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
    activities, return on average assets and return on average
    equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers:

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from
    $438.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $550.3 million in
    fiscal 2008;

•

We expect to generate between $650 million and
    $700 million of net cash from operating activities in
    fiscal 2009;

•

Return on average assets (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of total assets at the beginning and ending of
    the fiscal year) decreased from 12.7 percent in fiscal 2007
    to 9.9 percent in fiscal 2008. Return on average assets
    would have increased in fiscal 2008 when compared with fiscal
    2007 absent the impact of the fiscal 2007 $143.1 million
    after-tax gain on the combination with Stratex; and

•

Return on average equity (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of shareholders’ equity at the beginning
    and ending of the fiscal year) decreased from 26.9 percent
    in fiscal 2007 to 21.3 percent in fiscal 2008. Return on
    average equity would have increased in fiscal 2008 when compared
    with fiscal 2007 absent the impact of the fiscal 2007
    $143.1 million after-tax gain on the combination with
    Stratex.

Industry-Wide
    Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Defense Markets:

The DoD’s budget
    proposal for the U.S. Government fiscal years 2009 to 2013
    supports military readiness, with a continued focus on
    modernizing the country’s military infrastructure and
    addressing the evolving requirements of

modern-day

warfare. As a result, we expect the U.S. Government to
    remain committed to funding intelligence, information
    superiority, special operations and warfighter support.
    Requirements to upgrade and modernize tactical radio
    communications capabilities and provide more secure,
    interoperable and reliable communications should remain a
    funding priority. International defense forces continue to drive
    toward tactical communications upgrades and interoperability
    with the systems and equipment used by the U.S. Government.

The $515.4 billion DoD U.S. Government Fiscal Year
    (“GFY”) 2009 budget request is approximately
    7 percent above GFY 2008 levels. This base budget excludes
    emergency supplemental funding, such as the $189 billion
    for



GFY 2008 ($87 billion of which has been appropriated) and
    $70 billion requested for GFY 2009, primarily to support
    the Global War on Terror.

The DoD Operations and Maintenance account
    (“O&M”), which contains the bulk of funding for
    training, logistics, services and other logistical support, is a
    major account of importance to the defense industry. The budget
    for GFY 2009 is approximately $179.8 billion, an increase
    of $15.6 billion, or 10% over GFY 2008 enacted levels.

While the DoD’s overall budget increase may be a positive
    indicator of growth for the defense industry, we believe that
    the level of growth and budget amounts allocated to DoD
    procurement accounts (“Procurement”), along with
    research, development, test and evaluation
    (“RDT&E”) components of the DoD budget, are a
    better indicator of DoD spending. These accounts are applicable
    to defense contractors because they generally represent the
    amounts that are expended for military hardware and technology.

While there is no assurance that the requested DoD budget
    increases will continue to be approved by Congress, the current
    outlook appears to be one of increased DoD spending, which we
    believe will continue to positively affect our future orders,
    sales, income and cash flows. Conversely, a decline in the DoD
    budget may have a negative effect on future orders, sales,
    income and cash flows of defense contractors, including us,
    depending on the weapons platforms and programs affected by such
    budget reductions.

International governments are also expected to continue to
    increase their defense spending on national security and
    combatting the Global War on Terror, which we believe will
    continue to positively affect our future orders, sales, income
    and cash flows.

Government Markets Other Than
    Defense:

A funding priority for the
    U.S. Government is the security of the U.S., which includes
    better communications interplay among law enforcement, civil
    government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military
    services. Funding for investments in secure tactical
    communications, information technology, information processing
    and additional communications assets and upgrades remains solid.
    Another priority of the U.S. Government is investments in
    productivity, cost reductions and outsourcing. As a result,
    programs that promote these initiatives are also expected to
    receive funding. We provide products and services to a number of
    U.S. Government agencies including the FAA, NRO, NGA,
    Census Bureau, Department of State, NSA, NOAA and others. Recent
    trends continue to indicate an increase in demand from these
    agencies to outsource their requirements for better, more
    efficient and less costly information technology and
    communications.

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to
    U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may
    investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with
    applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of
    those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could
    make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement
    regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a
    government contractor could result in that contractor being
    fined

and/or

suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new
    U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar
    government oversight exists in most other countries where we
    conduct business. We are currently not aware of any compliance
    audits or investigations that could result in a significant
    adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

While recent developments in the defense and government industry
    have had a positive impact on our Defense Communications and
    Electronics and Government Communications Systems segments, we
    remain subject to other risks associated with
    U.S. Government business, including technological
    uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment
    of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are
    discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and under
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Commercial Broadcast Communications and Wireless
    Transmission Markets:

Global economic growth
    rates continue at modest levels in the broadcast and wireless
    transmission markets.

Global trends and developments in the broadcast communications
    market include:

•

Transitioning from analog to digital media and HD content
    continues to reshape the broadcast and other media markets and
    drive demand;

•

Continuing consolidation in broadcast and other media operators
    is creating larger enterprises seeking suppliers with a broad
    portfolio of hardware and software solutions to support all
    aspects of their operations;

•

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
    mandating a DTV roll-out. Congressional legislation requires the
    return of all analog frequencies from the broadcasters by
    February 17, 2009. The returned analog spectrum will be
    available for auction by the FCC for new commercial uses,
    industry, media and mobile telecom services;



•

Domestic radio broadcasters taking steps to transition from
    analog to digital technology. There are approximately 14,000
    radio stations in the United States and approximately 1,700
    radio stations currently

on-air

with
    HD Radio; and

•

The worldwide transition to digital technologies, which is in
    various stages of implementation. Many international markets
    remain primarily analog replacement markets.

Global trends and developments in the wireless transmission
    market include:

•

Continuing build-out of wireless networks in emerging markets to
    meet rapid subscriber growth;

•

Increasing demand for wireless transmission products due to
    build-outs for third-generation (“3G”) services
    rapidly increasing the number of cell sites;

•

Increasing demand to support capacity needs for
    “triple-play” services;

•

Continuing fixed-line to mobile-line substitution;

•

Private networks and public telecommunications operators
    building high-reliability, high-bandwidth data networks that are
    more secure and better protected against natural and man-made
    disasters;

•

Continuing global mobile operator consolidation;

•

Continuing transition to

IP-capable

mobile networks; and

•

The evolution of fourth generation (“4G”) technologies.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
    well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
    the market trends noted above in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

While we believe that these developments generally will have a
    positive impact on us, we remain subject to general economic
    conditions that could adversely affect our customers. We also
    remain subject to other risks associated with these markets,
    including technological uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s
    regulations, slow market adoption of digital radio and DTV or
    any of our new products and other risks which are discussed
    below under “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that
    May Affect Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” in this Annual Report on

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our revenue for fiscal 2008 was
    $5,311.0 million, an increase of 25.2 percent compared
    with fiscal 2007. Net income for fiscal 2008 was
    $444.2 million, a decrease of 7.5 percent compared
    with fiscal 2007 net income of $480.4 million. Fiscal
    2008 revenue increased as compared with fiscal 2007 in all four
    of our business segments. Fiscal 2008 revenue increased by
    41.4 percent in our Harris Stratex Networks segment,
    32.2 percent in our Government Communications Systems
    segment, primarily as a result of the June 2007 acquisition of
    Multimax, 18.9 percent in our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment and 7.3 percent in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. While fiscal 2008 revenue increases
    benefited from the acquisitions of Multimax and Zandar and the
    combination with Stratex, we also had strong organic revenue
    growth in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2008 net income decreased from fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to a $163.4 million gain ($143.1 million
    after-tax) recorded in fiscal 2007 in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment as a result of the combination with Stratex.
    Integration and transaction-related costs associated with the
    Stratex combination were $46.0 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $38.7 million in fiscal 2008. Additionally, Harris Stratex
    Networks fiscal 2008 operating income was negatively impacted by
    non-cash accounting adjustments and higher operating costs
    including orders-based sales compensation expense, an increase
    in the allowance for doubtful accounts and outside consultant
    fees. Our Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    continued its strong operating income trends in fiscal 2008 with
    a 23.1 percent increase over fiscal 2007 operating income.
    Operating income in our Government Communications Systems
    segment increased 7.0 percent over fiscal 2007 operating
    income, primarily due to the acquisition of Multimax partially
    offset by $75.9 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2008
    for schedule and cost overruns on several fixed-price commercial
    satellite reflector programs. Operating income in our Broadcast
    Communications



segment improved significantly, from $11.9 million in
    fiscal 2007 to $33.8 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007
    operating income in this segment was adversely impacted by
    $7.5 million of charges associated with cost-reduction
    actions and an $18.9 million write-down of capitalized
    software associated with management’s decision to
    discontinue an automation software development effort.

Net interest expense increased from $27.6 million in fiscal
    2007 to $48.4 million in fiscal 2008, mainly due to
    increased borrowings related to the acquisition of Multimax in
    June 2007, as well as lower average cash balances and lower
    interest rates on invested cash. Fiscal 2008 non-operating
    income was $11.4 million, which included $9.8 million
    in gains related to the sale of marketable equity securities.
    Fiscal 2007 non-operating loss was $16.2 million, which
    included a $19.8 million write-down of our investment in
    Terion due to an other-than-temporary impairment.

In fiscal 2008 our effective tax rate (income taxes as a
    percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest)
    was 31.6 percent compared with an effective tax rate of
    28.9 percent in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, our effective
    tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate because of
    an $11 million favorable impact from the settlement of
    U.S. Federal income tax audits for fiscal years 2004
    through 2006. Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2008,
    we began recording state income taxes in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income as engineering, selling and administrative
    expenses to the extent these taxes are reimbursed under
    government contracts, which totaled $9.9 million for fiscal
    2008. Under U.S. Government regulations, these state income
    taxes are allowable in establishing prices for the products and
    services we sell to the U.S. Government. Prior to the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008, these state income taxes were recorded
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income as income taxes. The
    reimbursement of these state income taxes is recorded in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income as revenue for all periods
    presented. As a result of this change, we reduced total income
    tax expense by approximately $6.4 million in fiscal 2008.
    This change will also lower our effective tax rate in future
    quarters.

In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate was lower than the
    U.S. statutory tax rate because of the tax-free nature of
    the combination with Stratex, and a $12 million favorable
    impact from the settlement concerning the tax audit for fiscal
    years 2001, 2002 and 2003. These favorable impacts to our
    effective tax rate were partially offset by transaction-related
    costs incurred in our Harris Stratex Networks segment and
    cost-reduction initiatives in our Broadcast Communications
    segment in foreign jurisdictions where we have significant net
    operating losses and where we were unable to realize a tax
    benefit associated with these charges.

See the “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion
    below in this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our revenue for fiscal 2007 was
    $4,243.0 million, an increase of 22.1 percent compared
    with fiscal 2006. Net income for fiscal 2007 was
    $480.4 million, an increase of 101.9 percent compared
    with fiscal 2006 net income of $237.9 million. Fiscal
    2007 revenue increased as compared to fiscal 2006 in all four of
    our business segments and was led by the increase in our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment, which increased 45.7 percent, and
    our Defense Communications and Electronics segment, which
    increased 28.5 percent. Our Harris Stratex Networks
    segment’s fiscal 2007 revenue increase was primarily due to
    the impact of the combination of our former Microwave
    Communications segment with Stratex in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2007.

The fiscal 2007 increase in net income was led by a
    $166.5 million increase in operating income in our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment as a result of the combination with
    Stratex in fiscal 2007, including a $163.4 million gain
    ($143.1 million after-tax) as a result of the transaction,
    partially offset by $46.0 million of transaction-related
    and integration costs. Our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment also had significant improvement in fiscal
    2007 operating income with a 37.6 percent increase over
    fiscal 2006. Our Broadcast Communications segment operating
    income was adversely impacted by $7.5 million of costs
    associated with cost-reduction actions in fiscal 2007 and the
    impact of an $18.9 million write-down of capitalized
    software associated with management’s decision to
    discontinue an automation software development effort.
    Headquarters expense decreased in fiscal 2007 to
    $69.6 million compared with $75.4 million in fiscal
    2006, primarily due to a $5.4 million charge related to our
    arbitration with Bourdex in fiscal 2006.

Net interest expense increased slightly from $24.7 million
    in fiscal 2006 to $27.6 million in fiscal 2007 mainly due
    to a

full-year

impact of our September 2005 issuance of $300 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes due 2015. Our
    non-operating loss in fiscal 2007 increased to
    $16.2 million in fiscal 2007, compared with
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2006, and included a
    $19.8 million write-down of our investment in Terion due to
    an other-than-temporary impairment. Our effective tax rate
    decreased from 37.5 percent in fiscal 2006 to
    28.9 percent in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the

tax-free

nature of the combination with Stratex and a favorable
    settlement that was approved by the United States Joint
    Committee on Taxation and related matters between us and the
    Internal Revenue Service concerning the tax audit for fiscal
    years 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    30.7 percent in fiscal 2008, compared with
    32.3 percent in fiscal 2007. Our overall blended fiscal
    2008 gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively
    impacted by a larger mix of sales coming from our lower-margin
    Government Communications Systems segment’s products and
    services in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily as
    a result of our acquisition of Multimax in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007. Government Communications Systems gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2008 was essentially flat
    compared with fiscal 2007, reflecting the positive impact from
    the acquisition of Multimax, offset by the negative impact from
    $75.9 million of charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs. Gross margin in our
    Harris Stratex Networks segment was impacted in fiscal 2008 and
    fiscal 2007 by $16.9 million and $8.7 million,
    respectively, due to integration-related activities associated
    with the Stratex combination, including the impact of a step up
    in inventory and fixed assets recorded as of the combination
    date in both years and an $11 million inventory write-down
    in fiscal 2008 related to an accelerated technology transition
    to

IP-based

products and other integration-related costs. Harris Stratex
    Networks fiscal 2008 gross margin was also negatively
    impacted by approximately $12 million of accounting
    adjustments related to reconciling inventory

work-in-process

accounts within a cost accounting system at one location
    primarily due to project cost variances that were not recorded
    to cost of sales in a timely manner. See the “Discussion of
    Business Segments” discussion below in this MD&A for
    further information.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    32.3 percent in fiscal 2007 compared with 31.3 percent
    in fiscal 2006. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue
    increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 in our
    Defense Communications and Electronics, Broadcast Communications
    and Harris Stratex Networks segments and decreased in our
    Government Communications Systems segment. Our overall blended
    fiscal 2007 gross margin as a percentage of revenue was
    positively impacted by a larger mix of sales coming from our
    higher-margin Defense Communications and Electronics
    segment’s products in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006
    and the impact of the Leitch, Aastra Digital Video and OSi
    acquisitions in fiscal 2006 in our Broadcast Communications
    segment. Gross margin decreased in our Government Communications
    Systems segment as a result of schedule and cost overruns on a
    commercial satellite reflector program absorbed during fiscal
    2007. Gross margin in our Harris Stratex Networks segment was
    adversely impacted in fiscal 2006 by $35.0 million of
    inventory write-downs and other charges associated with product
    discontinuances and the shut down of manufacturing activities in
    our Montreal, Canada plant. Gross margin in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment was impacted in fiscal 2007 by
    $8.7 million of lower margins being recognized subsequent
    to our combination with Stratex due to a step up in inventory
    and fixed assets recorded as of the combination date. The gross
    margin in our Broadcast Communications segment was adversely
    impacted in fiscal 2006 by $11.3 million of inventory
    write-downs associated with cost-reduction actions, including
    the transfer of European manufacturing operations to the United
    States and outsourcing of other manufacturing activity and
    $2.7 million of lower margin being recognized subsequent to
    our acquisition of Leitch due to a step up in inventory recorded
    as of the acquisition date. See the “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussion below in this MD&A for further

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased from $830.7 million in
    fiscal 2007 to $953.8 million in fiscal 2008. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to
    18.0 percent in fiscal 2008 from 19.6 percent in
    fiscal 2007. Our Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to research and development costs
    associated with our Falcon III radio. Our Government
    Communications Systems segment engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased primarily due to the
    acquisition of Multimax in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and
    the impact of recording state income taxes allocated to
    government contracts. Our Harris Stratex Networks segment
    engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased
    primarily due to the combination with Stratex in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2007 including transaction-related and
    integration costs of $21.8 million and $37.3 million,
    in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Engineering,
    selling and administrative expenses also increased in our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher
    orders-based sales compensation expense, an increase in the
    allowance for doubtful accounts and outside consultant fees.
    Fiscal 2007 engineering, selling and administrative expenses in
    our Broadcast Communications segment reflected
    $26.4 million of costs incurred related to a write-down of
    capitalized software and cost-reduction actions. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $275.0 million in fiscal 2008
    compared with $234.6 million in fiscal 2007. The increase
    was primarily due to spending on the development of our
    Falcon III radio in our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment and Eclipse products in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased from $682.3 million in
    fiscal 2006 to $830.7 million in fiscal 2007. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses remained unchanged at
    19.6 percent in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The increase
    in the amount of our engineering, selling and administrative
    expenses was primarily related to the following in fiscal 2007:
    increased research and development costs associated with our
    Falcon III radio development; our combination with Stratex,
    including $37.3 million of transaction-related and
    integration costs; and $26.4 million of costs incurred
    related to a write-down of capitalized software and
    cost-reduction actions taken in our Broadcast Communications
    segment. See the “Discussion of Business Segments”
    discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $234.6 million in fiscal
    2007, compared with $197.8 million in fiscal 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to increased spending on the
    development of our Falcon III radio and the increased
    research and product development costs resulting from our
    acquisitions of Leitch in fiscal 2006 and Encoda in fiscal 2005.

    2007:

Our non-operating income was
    $11.4 million for fiscal 2008, compared with a
    non-operating loss of $16.2 million for fiscal 2007. Fiscal
    2008 non-operating income primarily resulted from a
    $5.6 million gain related to

mark-to-market

adjustments on warrants we held to acquire shares of AuthenTec,
    Inc. (“AuthenTec”), which were classified as
    derivatives, and gains of $9.8 million on the sale of a
    portion of our investment in AuthenTec, which is classified as
    marketable equity securities

available-for-sale.

The fiscal 2007 non-operating loss includes a $19.8 million

    fiscal 2007 to $55.7 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease
    in our interest income and increase in our interest expense in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to increased borrowings related to
    the acquisition of Multimax in June 2007, as well as lower
    average cash balances and lower interest rates on invested cash.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our interest income increased from
    $11.8 million in fiscal 2006 to $13.5 million in
    fiscal 2007 due to a higher average balance of cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments. Our interest expense
    increased from $36.5 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $41.1 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the full-year
    impact of the $300 million in aggregate principal amount of

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our effective tax rate (income taxes as
    a percentage of income before income taxes and minority
    interest) was 31.6 percent for fiscal 2008, compared with
    28.9 percent in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, our effective
    tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate
    because of an $11 million favorable impact from the
    settlement of U.S. Federal income tax audits for fiscal
    years 2004 through 2006. Additionally, in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we began recording state income taxes in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income as engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses to the extent these taxes are reimbursed
    under government contracts, which totaled $9.9 million for
    fiscal 2008. Under U.S. Government regulations, these state
    income taxes are allowable in establishing prices for the
    products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Prior
    to the third quarter of fiscal 2008, these state income taxes
    were recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income as income
    taxes. The reimbursement of these state income taxes is recorded
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income as revenue. As a result
    of this change, we reduced total income tax expense by
    approximately $6.4 million in fiscal 2008. This change will
    also lower our effective tax rate in future years. In fiscal
    2007, our effective tax rate was lower than the
    U.S. statutory income tax rate because of several items,
    including a $12 million favorable impact from the
    settlement between us and the Internal Revenue Service
    concerning the tax audit for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
    The remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily
    due to the

tax-free

nature of the combination with Stratex, which resulted in a
    $163.4 million pre-tax gain ($143.1 million
    after-tax), partially offset by transaction-related costs
    incurred in our Harris Stratex Networks segment and by
    cost-reduction initiatives in our Broadcast Communications
    segment in foreign jurisdictions where we have significant net
    operating losses and where we were unable to recognize a tax
    benefit associated with these charges due to uncertainty about
    their realization. See

Note 22: Income Taxes

in the
    Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our effective tax rate decreased from
    37.5 percent in fiscal 2006 to 28.9 percent in fiscal
    2007. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was lower than the
    U.S. statutory income tax rate because of several items.
    The United States Joint Committee on Taxation approved a
    favorable settlement between us and the Internal Revenue Service
    concerning the tax audit for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
    The settlement, together with related matters, reduced tax
    expense in an aggregate amount of $12 million. The
    remaining decrease in the provision for income taxes was
    primarily due to the

tax-free

nature of the combination with Stratex in fiscal 2007, which
    resulted in a $163.4 million pre-tax gain
    ($143.1 million after-tax), partially offset by



transaction-related

costs incurred in our Harris Stratex Networks segment and by
    cost-reduction initiatives in our Broadcast Communications
    segment in foreign jurisdictions where we have significant net
    operating losses and where we were unable to recognize a tax
    benefit associated with these charges due to uncertainty about
    their realization. See

Discussion
    of Business Segments

As discussed further in

Note 23:

Business
    Segments

in the Notes, effective for fiscal 2008 (which
    began June 30, 2007), our Defense Programs business unit
    (part of our Government Communications Systems segment for
    fiscal 2007) was combined with our RF Communications
    business, and the combined business is reported as our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment for fiscal 2008. Our
    Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments
    did not change as a result of these adjustments to our
    organizational structure. The historical results, discussion and
    presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Annual Report on

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Defense Communications and Electronics
    segment revenue increased 18.9 percent and operating income
    increased 23.1 percent from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.
    Revenue growth was driven by a 27.8 percent increase in our
    RF Communications business primarily as a result of continuing
    strong market demand, and also, we believe, because of customer
    preference in both U.S. and international markets for
    Harris Falcon tactical radios. Worldwide demand for Harris
    software-defined tactical radios was driven by multiple factors,
    including modernization programs, force expansion, force
    restructuring, interoperability requirements and requirements
    for network-centric communications. Our customers’
    priorities continue to evolve across the defense, homeland
    security, public safety and peacekeeping landscape. Their
    communications systems need to be versatile and adaptable in
    order to be effective in multiple operating environments and
    missions. We expect that demand will continue to increase for
    network-centric communications systems that can significantly
    improve situational awareness and force effectiveness through
    communications superiority. Harris Falcon radios embrace these
    changing mission priorities and we believe offer superior
    multimission performance.

In our Defense Programs business, revenue decreased
    1.2 percent in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007.
    Fiscal 2007 benefited from higher levels of production on the

F/A-18

and
    F-22 aircraft programs. Programs in fiscal 2008 in our Defense
    Programs business with higher revenue included the CDL Hawklink
    program for the U.S. Navy, the WIN-T program for the
    U.S. Army, the MIDS terminals program for the DoD and
    tactical SATCOM.

The fiscal 2008 operating income increase over fiscal 2007 in
    our Defense Communications and Electronics segment was primarily
    driven by higher sales volume from increased sales of our
    Falcon III handheld radio units. Engineering, selling and
    administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from
    fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment as our expenses increased at a lower rate
    than revenue. This segment continued, however, to increase its
    investment in research and development associated with our
    Falcon III product family.

Orders for fiscal 2008 were $2.2 billion for this segment
    compared with $1.8 billion for fiscal 2007. During fiscal
    2008 this segment derived 86 percent of its revenue from
    the U.S. Government compared with 83 percent in fiscal
    2007.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Defense Communications and Electronics
    segment revenue increased 28.5 percent and operating income
    increased 37.6 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007.
    Strong revenue growth came from both U.S. and international
    markets, fueled by ongoing tactical radio modernization
    programs, and also by the CDL Hawklink program for the
    U.S. Navy, the MIDS terminals program for the DoD, and
    aircraft avionics for the F-22A Raptor. Demand for our
    Falcon II and Falcon III tactical radios was driven by
    their advanced



features and strong performance in the field. Significant
    programs in fiscal 2007 for our Defense Programs area included
    the

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

By the end of fiscal 2007, we delivered over 17,000 units
    of our next-generation Falcon III multiband handheld radio.
    The Falcon III handheld radio is the first widely-fielded
    tactical radio to receive certification from the JTRS JPEO and
    the NSA. Customers for the Falcon III handheld and
    vehicular radio systems include the U.S. Army,
    U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, as well as other U.S.
    Government agencies. The Falcon III has been well received
    by the market and is providing true multimode operational
    capabilities, including

ground-to-ground,

ground-to-air

and long-range tactical satellite communications. The
    Falcon III multiband manpack radio, released in September
    2007, is the first NSA-certified radio to provide wideband
    secure networking for data-intensive applications, such as video
    transmission in mobile battlefield conditions.

The fiscal 2007 operating income increase in our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment was driven primarily by
    higher sales volume from increased sales of our Falcon III
    handheld radio units. As a percentage of sales, engineering,
    selling and administrative expense decreased from fiscal 2006 to
    2007 in our Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    primarily due to the 28.5 percent increase in revenue. This
    segment continued, however, to invest in research and
    development costs associated with the development of our
    Falcon III product family. To continue to meet strong
    demand across all RF Communications product lines in this
    segment, in fiscal 2007 we significantly expanded our radio
    manufacturing capacity.

Orders for fiscal 2007 were $1.8 billion for this segment
    compared with $1.6 billion for fiscal 2006. This segment
    derived 83 percent of its revenue from the
    U.S. Government in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 32.2 percent and operating income
    increased 7.0 percent from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.
    Organic revenue, excluding the impact of the acquisition of
    Multimax, increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007,
    and was primarily driven by the ramping up of the FDCA program
    for the U.S. Census Bureau and from classified programs for
    our national intelligence customers. Significant contributions
    to increased revenue in fiscal 2008 came from the FDCA program,
    the Patriot technical services program for the NRO, our
    classified programs, the VSCS program for the FAA, and the NSOM,
    NMCI and NETCENTS programs in our IT Services business unit.

The increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 was primarily
    due to the acquisition of Multimax and approximately
    $10.0 million of income related to the renegotiation of
    pricing on an IT services contract, partially offset by
    $75.9 million of charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    several fixed-price commercial satellite reflector programs,
    encompassing ten commercial reflectors in various stages of
    development, assembly, test and delivery. Due to technical
    difficulties experienced on these reflector programs, which
    necessitated design changes and associated cost increases, we
    also fell behind schedule. To mitigate the impact of these
    schedule changes, we began performing these programs in parallel
    rather than in series. This further adversely impacted costs, as
    costs from rework activities associated with further design
    changes were multiplied through all the reflectors in the
    factory. Additionally, engineering, selling and administrative
    expenses in this segment increased in fiscal 2008 when compared
    with fiscal 2007, partly due to a gain recorded on the sale of
    our STAT network security product line in fiscal 2007.

Orders for fiscal 2008 were $2.0 billion for this segment
    compared with $1.5 billion for fiscal 2007. During fiscal
    2008 this segment derived 96 percent of its revenue from
    the U.S. Government, including 15 percent from the
    FAA, compared with 93 percent in fiscal 2007, including
    20 percent from the FAA.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 13.9 percent and operating income
    decreased 1.0 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The
    increase in revenue primarily came from the FDCA program for the
    U.S. Census Bureau, the FTI program for the FAA, the
    Patriot technical services program for the NRO, several new
    programs from our national intelligence customers and the
    acquisition of Multimax on June 15, 2007. Significant
    programs in fiscal 2007 included FTI, Patriot, FDCA,



MCOM, MTAIP, OSSS, State 6 program for the U.S. Department
    of State Bureau of Consular Affairs and various classified
    programs.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
    decreased slightly during fiscal 2007 when compared with fiscal
    2006, primarily due to schedule and cost overruns on a satellite
    reflector program absorbed during fiscal 2007, which were
    partially offset by favorable program profit margin mix.
    Engineering, selling and administrative expenses in this segment
    decreased in fiscal 2007 when compared with fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to a gain recorded on the sale of our STAT network
    security product line in fiscal 2007.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our
    acquisition of Multimax, a leading provider of information
    technology and network services for the U.S. Government.
    With this acquisition, we nearly doubled our IT services
    revenue, added a number of new customers across the DoD and
    civilian agencies for our IT Services business unit, and gained
    positions on long-term U.S. Government IT services contracts.
    For further information related to the acquisition of Multimax,
    including the allocation of the purchase price and pro forma
    results as if the acquisition of Multimax had taken place as of
    the beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 3:
    Business Combinations

in the Notes.

Orders for fiscal 2007 were $1.5 billion for this segment.
    During fiscal 2007 this segment derived 93 percent of its
    revenue from the U.S. Government, including 20 percent
    from the FAA, compared with 93 percent in fiscal 2006,
    including 18 percent from the FAA.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue increased 7.3 percent in fiscal 2008 from fiscal
    2007, and operating income was $33.8 million in fiscal
    2008, compared with $11.9 million is fiscal 2007. Revenue
    growth in fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 was across
    all business areas in this segment. The Infrastructure and
    Networking Solutions businesses, including routers, graphics
    equipment and multiviewers had double-digit revenue growth in
    fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 sales of
    traffic and billing software solutions also improved,
    particularly in international markets, compared with fiscal
    2007. Sales of transmission systems grew in fiscal 2008,
    compared with fiscal 2007, as a result of strong shipments in
    the U.S. market for the

over-the-air

digital transmission build-out.

    broadcaster.

Fiscal 2008 operating income in this segment was adversely
    impacted by $2.0 million of costs associated with our
    acquisition of Zandar and a decrease in margins due to our
    transition to lead-free products. Fiscal 2007 operating income
    was adversely impacted by $7.5 million of costs associated
    with cost-reduction actions and an $18.9 million write-down
    of capitalized software associated with management’s
    decision to discontinue an automation software development
    effort.

Orders in our Broadcast Communications segment were
    $660 million in fiscal 2008, compared with
    $666 million in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue increased 11.3 percent and operating income
    decreased 47.8 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The
    increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the full-year
    benefit in fiscal 2007 of the acquisitions of Leitch and
    Aastra Digital Video made during fiscal 2006 and increased
    demand for our Infrastructure and Networking Solutions (formerly
    Video Infrastructure & Digital Media) products.
    Investments in

analog-to-digital

and HD systems are enabling content providers and broadcasters
    to create, manage and deliver additional channels and video
    streams to



consumers. Radio Transmission systems revenue also increased as
    a result of further penetration of the new Harris
    Flexstar

tm

exciter. Revenue was lower in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal
    2006 in U.S. DTV transmission and software solutions
    products. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we exited
    our radio resale distribution channel, which involved sales of
    non-Harris OEM radio products at low gross margins, sold
    primarily through a telemarketing group.

Operating income in fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by an
    $18.9 million write-down of capitalized software and a
    $7.5 million charge related to cost-reduction actions. The
    write-down of capitalized software was a result of
    management’s decision to discontinue a software development
    effort. Operating income was also negatively impacted by the
    significant decline in U.S. DTV transmission and software
    solutions revenue, and by increased expenses associated with the
    investment and deployment of new software products including OSi
    Traffic,

H-Class Total

Content Delivery, and Invenio Digital Asset Management.

Orders in our Broadcast Communications segment increased
    30.3 percent from $511 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $666 million in fiscal 2007.

On January 26, 2007 we combined our former Microwave
    Communications Division with Stratex to create Harris Stratex
    Networks. We owned approximately 57 percent of the
    outstanding shares of Harris Stratex Networks at the time of the
    combination and approximately 56 percent as of
    June 27, 2008. Following the combination, our business
    segment formerly referred to as Microwave Communications is
    referred to as Harris Stratex Networks and includes the results
    of the combined business for periods following the combination.
    Accordingly, our fiscal 2008 financial results include a full
    year of Harris Stratex Networks (on a fully consolidated basis,
    with an elimination of the minority interest), compared with our
    fiscal 2007 financial results, which included five months of
    Harris Stratex Networks.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Harris Stratex Networks segment revenue
    increased 41.4 percent from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. We
    also had organic revenue growth in fiscal 2008, excluding the
    impact of the combination with Stratex, when compared with
    fiscal 2007. This segment had an operating loss of
    $28.5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with operating income
    of $146.9 million in fiscal 2007.

All three of the Harris Stratex Networks business
    units — North America Microwave, International
    Microwave and Network Operations — generated increased
    revenue in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007. Harris
    Stratex Networks continued to benefit in fiscal 2008 from the
    transition to IP-based products, the evolution to 4G
    technologies, and the wireless network infrastructure expansion
    in emerging regions. Demand for the Eclipse product line was
    particularly strong late in fiscal 2008.

The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007
    was primarily due to the $163.4 million

pre-tax

gain
    recorded in fiscal 2007 on the combination with Stratex, which
    was partially offset by $46.0 million of related
    transaction and integration costs. Operating income in fiscal
    2008 was adversely impacted by $38.7 million of transaction
    and integration costs associated with the Stratex combination,
    including a step up in fixed assets recorded as of the
    combination date, an $11 million inventory write-down
    related to an accelerated technology transition to

IP-based

products and other integration-related costs. Operating income
    was also negatively impacted by higher costs relating to
    orders-based sales compensation, an increase in the allowance
    for doubtful accounts and outside consulting fees as well as
    non-cash accounting adjustments. The majority of the accounting
    adjustments related to reconciling inventory

work-in-process

accounts within a cost accounting system at one location
    primarily due to project cost variances that were not recorded
    to cost of sales in a timely manner. In addition, the accounting
    adjustments included the correction of errors in balancing
    intercompany accounts that had resulted in an overstatement of
    accounts receivable.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Harris Stratex Networks segment revenue
    increased 45.7 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The
    segment also had organic revenue growth in fiscal 2007,
    excluding the impact



of the combination with Stratex, when compared with fiscal 2006.
    This segment had operating income of $146.9 million in
    fiscal 2007 compared with an operating loss of
    $19.6 million in fiscal 2006.

North America Microwave revenue increased by $48 million,
    or 28 percent, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Revenue for
    fiscal 2007 included $8 million of revenue related to the
    combination with Stratex. The remainder of the increase in North
    America Microwave was primarily due to increased demand for our
    products driven by mobile operators that are upgrading and
    expanding networks for high-bandwidth voice, data and video
    services and by private networks upgrading for increased
    reliability, survivability and interoperability. International
    Microwave revenue increased by $109 million, or
    67 percent, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Revenue in
    fiscal 2007 included $116 million of revenue related to the
    combination with Stratex. This increase in International
    Microwave revenue from the combination with Stratex was
    partially offset by lower revenue due to the timing of project
    awards.

We recorded a $163.4 million pre-tax gain on the
    transaction in fiscal 2007 that relates to the deemed sale for
    accounting purposes of 43 percent of the assets and
    liabilities of our former Microwave Communications business to
    the minority shareholders of Harris Stratex Networks.
    Additionally, we incurred $28.8 million of
    transaction-related costs such as the write-off of in-process
    research and development and the impact of a step up in
    inventory and fixed assets and $17.2 million of integration
    costs. For further information related to the combination with
    Stratex, including the allocation of the purchase price and pro
    forma results as if the combination with Stratex had taken place
    as of the beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 3: Business Combinations

and

Note 4:
    Ownership in Harris Stratex Networks

in the Notes.

These gains and charges were partially offset by income
    generated from the operations acquired from Stratex, and by the
    increased gross margin generated by the increased revenues from
    our North America microwave business.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Headquarters expense increased
    6.3 percent from $69.6 million in fiscal 2007 to
    $74.0 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to costs
    incurred related to IT systems upgrades. As a percentage of
    revenue, headquarters expense decreased from 1.6 percent in
    fiscal 2007 to 1.4 percent in fiscal 2008. Corporate
    eliminations decreased from $11.7 million in fiscal 2007 to
    $5.4 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to less
    intersegment activity on our FTI program and with Harris Stratex
    Networks.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Headquarters expense decreased
    7.7 percent from $75.4 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $69.6 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of revenue,
    headquarters expense decreased from 2.2 percent in fiscal
    2006 to 1.6 percent in fiscal 2007. The decrease in
    headquarters expense was primarily due to a $5.4 million
    charge recorded in fiscal 2006 associated with a decision we
    received in our arbitration with Bourdex. Corporate eliminations
    decreased from $16.6 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $11.7 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to less
    intersegment activity on our FTI and Radiocommunicatii programs.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Our cash and
    cash equivalents increased $1.7 million from
    $368.3 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to
    $370.0 million at the end of fiscal 2008. The increase was
    primarily due to $550.3 million of cash flow generated from
    operating activities, mostly offset by $225.0 million of
    common stock repurchases,



$146.2 million of cash paid for property, plant, and
    equipment and capitalized software, and $138.9 million of
    net cash used to reduce borrowings. We own approximately
    56 percent of Harris Stratex Networks, which had a cash
    balance of $95.5 million included in our consolidated cash
    and cash equivalents balance of $370.0 million as of
    June 27, 2008. The $95.5 million balance is available
    only for Harris Stratex Networks’ general corporate
    purposes.

We currently believe that existing cash, funds generated from
    operations, sales of marketable equity securities, our credit
    facilities and access to the public and private debt and equity
    markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated
    working capital requirements, capital expenditures and share
    repurchases under our current repurchase program for the next
    12 months and the foreseeable future. We anticipate tax
    payments over the next three years to be approximately equal to
    our tax expense during the same period. We anticipate that our
    fiscal 2009 cash outlays may include strategic acquisitions.
    Other than those noted in the “Contractual
    Obligations” discussion below in this MD&A, capital
    expenditures, potential acquisitions and repurchases under our
    share repurchase program, no other significant cash outlays are
    anticipated in fiscal 2009 and thereafter.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
    continue to generate cash flow at current levels, or that
    anticipated operational improvements will be achieved. If we are
    unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash
    flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be
    required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or
    terminate our share repurchase program, reduce or eliminate
    dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or
    obtain additional financing. Our ability to make principal
    payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness
    depends on our future performance and financial results, which,
    to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
    affecting the defense, government, broadcast communications and
    wireless transmission markets and to general economic,
    political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory
    factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    operating activities was $550.3 million in fiscal 2008
    compared with $438.6 million in fiscal 2007. All of our
    segments had positive cash flow in fiscal 2008 and all four
    segments had improved cash flow in fiscal 2008 when compared
    with fiscal 2007. The improvement was led by our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment, which primarily resulted
    from higher operating income. We expect cash flow provided by
    operating activities in fiscal 2009 to be between
    $650 million and $700 million.

Net cash used in investing
    activities:

Our net cash used in investing
    activities was $134.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with
    $382.9 million in fiscal 2007. Net cash used in investing
    activities in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to
    $112.9 million of property, plant and equipment additions,
    $33.3 million of capitalized software additions and
    $19.4 million of cash paid for acquisitions. This was
    partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of securities
    and short-term investments

available-for-sale

of $31.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities in
    fiscal 2007 was due to net $371.5 million cash paid for
    business acquisitions and combinations, $88.8 million for
    additions of property, plant and equipment and
    $40.3 million for additions of capitalized software offset
    by $117.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments. Our total additions of capitalized
    software and property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2009 are
    expected to be in the $170 million to $180 million
    range.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
    activities:

Our net cash used in financing
    activities in fiscal 2008 was $413.4 million compared with
    net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2007 of
    $133.3 million. Net cash used in financing activities in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to $225.0 million used for
    the repurchase of shares of common stock, net repayments of
    borrowings of $138.9 million and payment of $81.5 million
    of cash dividends, partially offset by proceeds from the
    exercise of employee stock options of $40.8 million. In
    fiscal 2008, we issued 1,367,588 shares of common stock to
    employees under the terms of our option and incentive plans.

The net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2007 was
    primarily from the issuance of $400.0 million in commercial
    paper issued in connection with the acquisition of Multimax and
    proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
    $35.7 million, partially offset by the payment of cash
    dividends totaling $58.2 million and the repurchase of
    shares of common stock of $246.9 million. In fiscal 2007,
    we issued 1,673,501 shares of common stock to employees
    under the terms of our option and incentive plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2008, we used $225 million to repurchase
    3,945,136 shares of our common stock at an average price
    per share of $57.02, including commissions. During fiscal 2007,
    we used $246.9 million to repurchase 4,959,499 shares
    of our common stock at an average price per share of $49.79,
    including commissions. During fiscal 2007, our Board of
    Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing
    the repurchase of up to $600 million in shares of our
    common stock. As of June 27, 2008, we have repurchased a
    total of approximately $425 million in shares of our common
    stock under this program since it was approved.



While this program does not have a stated expiration date, we
    expect to repurchase during fiscal 2009 the remaining
    approximately $175 million in shares of our common stock
    authorized to be repurchased under this program. We currently
    expect that these repurchases will more than offset the dilutive
    effect of shares to be issued under our share-based incentive
    plans. Share repurchases are expected to be funded with
    available cash. Repurchases under the program may be made
    through open market purchases, private transactions,
    transactions structured through investment banking institutions
    or any combination thereof. The timing, volume and nature of
    share repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable
    securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and
    may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Additional
    information regarding repurchases made during fiscal 2008 and
    our repurchase programs is set forth above in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

under Part II, “Item 5. Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Dividend
    Policy

On August 23, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a
    quarterly common stock dividend of $0.20 per share, for an
    annualized rate of $0.80 per share, which was our seventh
    consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Our
    annual common stock dividend was $0.60, $0.44, and
    $0.32 per share in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Additional information concerning our dividends is
    set forth above in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

under Part II, “Item 5. Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Capital
    Structure and Resources

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans and letters of credit issuances at any time
    and from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement,
    in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
    exceed $500 million (we may request an increase, not to
    exceed an additional $250 million). The Credit Agreement
    may be used for working capital and other general corporate
    purposes and to support any commercial paper that we may issue.
    At our election, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear
    interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the
    base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the
    higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50 percent or
    SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced prime lending rate. The
    Credit Agreement provides that the interest rate margin over
    LIBOR, currently set at 0.40 percent, will increase or
    decrease within certain limits based on changes in the ratings
    of our senior, unsecured long-term debt securities. We are also
    permitted to request borrowings with interest rates and terms
    that are to be set pursuant to competitive bid procedures or
    directly negotiated with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
    consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
    transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
    of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
    prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
    capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
    consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
    from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
    period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
    including: payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
    and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
    warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
    amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
    more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
    debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
    immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the Credit Agreement are due and mature on March 31,
    2010, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at
    our request or if certain events of default occur. At
    June 27, 2008, no borrowings were outstanding under the
    Credit Agreement.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the



aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus
    accrued interest on the notes repurchased to the date of
    repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the notes, we
    entered into treasury lock agreements to protect against
    fluctuations in the forecasted interest payments resulting from
    the issuance of ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in the
    benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. In accordance with Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“Statement 133”), these agreements were determined to
    be highly effective in offsetting changes in forecasted interest
    payments as a result of changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury
    rate. Upon termination of these agreements on December 6,
    2007, we recorded a loss of $5.5 million, net of income
    tax, in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. This loss, along with
    $5.0 million in debt issuance costs, will be amortized over
    the life of the notes on a straight-line basis, which
    approximates the effective interest rate method, and reflected
    as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement
    of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due August
    2022. On July 12, 2007, we initiated the steps necessary to
    redeem the debentures on August 20, 2007. However, prior to
    the date set for redemption, all of the debentures were
    converted by the holders into shares of our common stock at a
    conversion rate of 44.2404 shares of common stock for each
    $1,000 principal amount of debentures, with the exception of
    debentures in the principal amount of $3,000. This resulted in
    the issuance by us of 6,594,146 shares of common stock
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in respect of the
    debentures converted. On August 20, 2007, we redeemed the
    remaining debentures in the principal amount of $3,000.
    Accordingly, no debentures remained outstanding as of
    August 20, 2007. We incurred $4.8 million in debt
    issuance costs related to the issuance of the convertible
    debentures, which costs were amortized on a straight-line basis
    over a five-year period and reflected as a portion of interest
    expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures
    pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the option of the
    holders of the debentures. We may redeem the remaining
    $25.8 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures
    in whole, or in part, at any time at a pre-determined redemption
    price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
    potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

Prior to the combination with Stratex, Stratex was a party to a
    credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, and following the
    combination, Stratex (now named “Harris Stratex Networks
    Operating Corporation” and a

wholly-owned

subsidiary of Harris Stratex Networks), remained a party to the
    credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Harris
    Stratex Networks Credit Facility”). As discussed below, the
    Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility (the “Terminated
    Facility”) was terminated and replaced after the end of our
    fiscal 2008. Harris and its subsidiaries (other than Harris
    Stratex Networks Operating Corporation) are not and were not
    parties to, obligated under or guarantors of the Terminated
    Facility. Indebtedness under the Terminated Facility is
    reflected as of June 27, 2008 in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as a result of the consolidation of Harris Stratex
    Networks. The Terminated Facility allowed for revolving credit
    borrowings of up to $50 million. As of June 27, 2008,
    the balance of the term loan portion of the Terminated Facility
    was $8.7 million (of which $5.0 million is recorded in
    the current portion of long-term debt) and there was
    $8.6 million in outstanding standby letters of credit. The
    Terminated Facility agreement contained a minimum tangible net
    worth covenant and a liquidity ratio covenant.



On June 30, 2008, after the end of our fiscal 2008, the
    Terminated Facility was terminated and replaced with a new
    revolving credit facility as of that date with a syndicate of
    lenders, including Silicon Valley Bank (the “New Harris
    Stratex Networks Credit Facility”). Harris and its
    subsidiaries (other than Harris Stratex Networks and certain of
    its subsidiaries) are not parties to, obligated under or
    guarantors of the New Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility.
    The balance of the term loan portion of the Terminated Facility
    of $8.7 million was repaid in full with the proceeds of a
    $10 million borrowing under the New Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility. The standby letters of credit outstanding under
    the Terminated Facility as of the termination date remain as an
    obligation to Silicon Valley Bank. The New Harris Stratex
    Networks Credit Facility provides for an initial committed
    amount of $70 million with an uncommitted accordion option
    for an additional $50 million available with the same or
    additional lenders. The New Harris Stratex Networks Credit
    Facility has an initial term of three years and provides for
    (1) demand borrowings (with no stated maturity date) at the
    greater of Bank of America’s prime rate and the federal
    funds rate plus 0.5 percent,

(2) fixed-term

Eurodollar loans for six months or more as agreed with the
    lenders at LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.25 percent to
    2.00 percent based on the current leverage ratio of Harris
    Stratex Networks and its consolidated subsidiaries and
    (3) the issuance of standby or commercial letters of
    credit. The New Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility contains
    a minimum liquidity ratio covenant and a maximum leverage ratio
    covenant and is unsecured.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $2.7 million from various international banks,
    $2.4 million of which was available on June 27, 2008.
    These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
    typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
    terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and us, and are
    reviewed annually for renewal or modification. These lines do
    not require compensating balances. We also have a short-term
    commercial paper program in place, which we may utilize to
    satisfy short-term cash requirements and which is supported by
    our Credit Agreement. No amounts were outstanding under the
    commercial paper program at June 27, 2008.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB+” by Standard and
    Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa1” by Moody’s
    Investors Service, which was upgraded by Moody’s Investors
    Service during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 from
    “Baa2.” We expect to maintain operating ratios,
    fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient
    for retention of, or improvement to, these debt ratings. There
    are no assurances that our debt ratings will not be reduced in
    the future. If our debt ratings are lowered below
    “investment grade,” then we may not be able to issue
    short-term commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow
    under our credit facilities or pursue other options. We do not
    currently foresee losing our investment-grade debt ratings, but
    no assurances can be given. If our debt ratings were downgraded,
    however, it could adversely impact, among other things, our
    future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

Contractual
    Obligations

At June 27, 2008, we had contractual cash obligations to
    repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments
    under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term
    obligations are as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
    following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
    not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
    as defined above. As of June 27, 2008, we did not have
    material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
    that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of
    operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, we
    are not currently a party to any related party transactions that
    materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or
    financial condition.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
    and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
    provide representations, warranties

and/or

indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such
    as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot
    estimate the potential liability from such representations,
    warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown
    conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities
    relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities
    will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
    acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
    properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
    the event any of these third parties vacate any of these
    premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
    arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
    such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not
    material to our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Commercial
    Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. At June 27, 2008, we had commercial
    commitments on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and
    other arrangements, as follows:

Financial
    Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use
    foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance
    sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments.
    Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign
    currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from
    suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed sales
    to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use of
    foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks
    that arise from doing business in international markets. At
    June 27, 2008, we had open foreign exchange contracts with
    a notional amount of $127.8 million, of which
    $49.9 million were classified as cash flow hedges,
    $16.7 million were classified as fair value hedges and
    $61.2 million were not designated hedges under the
    provisions of Statement 133. This compares with total foreign
    exchange contracts with a notional amount of $107.2 million
    at June 29, 2007, of which $29.8 million were
    classified as cash flow hedges, $40.0 million were
    classified as fair value hedges and $37.4 million were not
    designated hedges under the provisions of Statement 133. At
    June 27, 2008, contract expiration dates ranged from less
    than one month to 22 months with a weighted average
    contract life of 2 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
    cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
    exposures from cash flows anticipated in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment related to customer orders denominated in
    non-functional currencies that are currently in backlog and in
    our Defense Communications and Electronics segment related to
    programs in the U.K., Canada and the Netherlands. We also have
    hedged U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
    anticipated profit margins in our international operations. As
    of June 27, 2008, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
    $1.7 million would be reclassified into net income from
    comprehensive income within the next 12 months related to
    these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
    hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. Amounts
    recognized in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006
    related to the component of the derivative instruments’
    gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
    were also not material. In addition, no amounts were recognized
    in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to
    hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
    hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
    value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with
    Statement 133.

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging
    programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
    estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
    availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
    change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
    derivatives held at June 27, 2008 would have an impact of
    approximately $8.4 million on the fair value of such
    instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
    associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
    take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
    value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments.

Interest Rates:

As of June 27,
    2008, we have short-term investments and long-term debt
    obligations subject to interest rate risk. The interest-rate
    risk associated with our short-term investments is not material
    as the maturities of these investments are less than one year.
    Because the interest rates on our long-term debt obligations are
    fixed, and because our long-term debt is not putable (redeemable
    by the holders of the debt prior to maturity), the interest rate
    risk associated with this debt on our results of operations is
    not material. We have a short-term variable-rate commercial
    paper program in place, which we may utilize to satisfy
    short-term cash requirements. The interest rate risk associated
    with our commercial paper is not material as these borrowings
    are only for short periods until refinanced by fixed-rate
    long-term debt or paid off using operating cash flows. We do not
    expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on
    income or cash flows in fiscal 2009, although there can be no
    assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.

Impact of
    Foreign Exchange

Approximately 54 percent of our international business was
    transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2008,
    compared with 36 percent in fiscal 2007. The impact of
    translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
    U.S. dollars is included as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. At June 27, 2008, the cumulative
    translation adjustment increased shareholders’ equity by
    $46.5 million compared with an increase of
    $24.3 million at June 29, 2007. We utilize foreign
    currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of
    international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our
    results in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.



Impact of
    Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
    practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
    inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
    cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing
    prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin,
    revenue or operating income in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
    of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
    accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
    our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
    transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
    estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the estimates
    discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial
    statements because their application places the most significant
    demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results
    relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical
    accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs.
    The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates
    on our business operations are discussed throughout this
    MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected
    financial results. Senior management has discussed the
    development and selection of the critical accounting policies
    and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with
    the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
    those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
    estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
    preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
    estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
    based on experience and other information available prior to the
    issuance of the financial statements. Materially different
    results can occur as circumstances change and additional
    information becomes known, including for estimates that we do
    not deem “critical.”

Revenue
    Recognition on Development and Production Contracts and Contract
    Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
    development and production contracts, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified
    Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
    accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
    Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”),

and cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. Government
    also are specifically accounted for in accordance with
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 11,
    Section A, “Government Contracts, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee
    Contracts” (“ARB 43”).

Revenue related to development and production contracts is
    recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
    to date against estimated total contract costs at completion

(“cost-to-cost”)

with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
    profit. The

percentage-of-completion

method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
    Government Communications Systems and Defense Communications and
    Electronics segments. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a
    contract are included in revenue only when they can be reliably
    estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
    and award fees applicable to performance on contracts are
    considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are
    recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
    anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions, which
    increase earnings based solely on a single significant event,
    generally are not recognized until the event occurs. Contracts
    generally are not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they
    meet the segmenting criteria stated in

SOP 81-1.

Under the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
    used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire
    period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and
    production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the
    contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at
    completion and the measurement of progress toward completion.
    The estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the
    difference between the estimated contract value and the
    estimated total cost at completion. Due to the

long-term

nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total
    cost at completion often requires significant judgment. Factors
    that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed
    include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature
    and complexity of the work to be performed, availability and
    cost of materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of
    delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the
    customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
    contract included in any estimate to complete. We



review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing
    contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more
    frequently. If a change in estimated cost to complete a contract
    is determined to have an impact on contract earnings, we will
    record a positive or negative adjustment to estimated earnings
    when identified. Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable
    contract are recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an
    amount equal to the allowable costs plus the profit on those
    costs. These profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of
    allowable costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement.
    Thus, cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to
    the same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We
    have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to
    estimate our costs related to development and production
    contracts in the past three fiscal years.

As of June 27, 2008, the amount of unbilled costs and
    accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts classified as
    Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was
    $256.5 million compared with $209.7 million as of
    June 29, 2007. These amounts include gross costs and
    accrued income, which is netted against billings and progress
    payments. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    programs could have a material effect on our statement of
    financial position and results of operations. For example, a one
    percent variance in our estimate of accrued income booked as of
    June 27, 2008 on all open fixed-price contracts would
    impact our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
    services by $11.0 million.

Provisions
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
    balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
    competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
    obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
    requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
    and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
    primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand,
    anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
    review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our
    business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and
    use of our inventories, including our decisions to exit a
    product line, technological change and new product development.
    These factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
    inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
    future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
    we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
    excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
    that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
    recognize such costs in “Cost of product sales” in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
    determination. In the case of goods which have been written down
    below cost at the close of a fiscal year, such reduced amount is
    to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. We
    have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology
    used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past
    three fiscal years.

As of June 27, 2008, our reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory was $80.2 million, or 11.6 percent of our
    gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of
    $55.9 million, or 9.1 percent of our gross inventory
    balance as of June 29, 2007. We recorded
    $17.5 million, $26.6 million and $81.3 million in
    inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess
    and obsolete inventory or our pre-tax income during fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. In fiscal 2006, we had significant
    write-downs in inventory due to the discontinuance of legacy
    products in our Harris Stratex Networks segment and the
    relocation of European manufacturing activities in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Although we make every reasonable effort
    to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product
    demand, including the impact of planned future product launches,
    any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and our reported operating results.

Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets” (“Statement 142”), we are required to
    perform an annual (or, under certain circumstances, more
    frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment
    is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
    which we define as our business segments, with its total assets,
    including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets
    as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
    its adjusted total assets, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted total assets of a reporting
    unit exceed its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
    The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized
    intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in



a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
    was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on
    projected cash flows, and sales and earnings multiples applied
    to the latest twelve months’ sales and earnings of our
    reporting units. Projected cash flows are based on our best
    estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet
    metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market
    conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash
    flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate which
    reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. The sales and
    earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our
    reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and
    earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings
    multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses
    made in the marketplace.

Because our Harris Stratex Networks segment is a publicly traded
    company, in addition to the models described above, we consider
    its average stock price multiplied by its outstanding shares in
    the estimation of its fair value. We then assess whether any
    implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value
    based purely on stock price and outstanding shares with fair
    value determined by using all of the above-described models, is
    reasonable. We have not made any material changes in the
    methodology used in the assessment of whether or not goodwill is
    impaired during the past three fiscal years.

We completed impairment tests as of March 28, 2008, with no
    adjustment required to the carrying value of goodwill. Goodwill
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2008 and
    June 29, 2007 was $1,547.3 million and
    $1,525.2 million, respectively. Although we make every
    reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the
    fair value of our reporting units, future changes in the
    assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the
    recording of an impairment loss. A 10 percent decrease in
    our estimate of the fair value of each of our segments would
    lead to further tests for impairment as described above only for
    our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks
    segments.

Income
    Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
    specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
    regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
    balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
    required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
    depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
    appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
    gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
    under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
    for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
    future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
    existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We
    have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three
    fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2008 includes
    a current deferred tax asset of $117.2 million and a
    non-current deferred tax liability of $29.8 million. This
    compares with a current deferred tax asset of $94.3 million
    and a non-current deferred tax liability of $61.8 million
    as of June 29, 2007. For all jurisdictions for which we
    have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels
    of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of
    future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. Our
    valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is
    reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was
    $200.5 million as of June 27, 2008 and
    $167.9 million as of June 29, 2007. Although we make
    every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our deferred
    tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain
    jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future
    taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual
    effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying
    temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the
    potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be
    required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a
    significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a
    substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material
    adverse impact on our operating results.

Stock
    Options and Share-Based Compensation

Effective July 2, 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment” (“Statement 123R”), which requires the
    measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
    stock-based payments made to our employees and directors,
    including employee stock option, performance share, performance
    unit, restricted stock and restricted unit awards based on
    estimated fair value. We previously applied the provisions of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (“APB 25”) and related interpretations
    and provided the required pro forma disclosures under Statement



of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation” (“Statement 123”).
    The compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a
    straight-line amortization method. Our net income for fiscal
    2008 includes a stock-based compensation expense of
    $38.2 million compared with fiscal 2007

stock-based

compensation expense of $28.7 million. As of June 27,
    2008, the total unrecorded stock-based compensation balance for
    unvested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was
    $52.2 million, which is expected to be amortized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

While fair value may be readily determinable for awards of
    stock, market quotes are not available for

long-term,

nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not
    traded. We currently use the

Black-Scholes-Merton

option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock
    options. We expect to continue to use the Black-Scholes-Merton
    model for valuing our stock-based compensation expense. Our
    estimate of grant date fair value and stock-based compensation
    expense is affected by a number of complex and subjective
    valuation assumptions and the related tax effect. These
    valuation assumptions include, but are not limited to, the
    volatility of our stock price, expected life and stock option
    exercise behaviors. We have not made any material changes in the
    methodologies used to determine the assumptions we use to
    estimate the fair value of our stock options during the past
    three fiscal years.

A change in any of these assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated fair value of any given grant and cause our results to
    be materially different. For example, a one-year increase in the
    estimated term of our stock options granted during fiscal 2008
    would have increased our compensation expense by
    $0.6 million in fiscal 2008 and a 400 basis-point increase
    in the assumed volatility rate of our stock options granted
    during fiscal 2008 would have increased our compensation expense
    by $0.5 million in fiscal 2008. See

Note 14: Stock
    Options and

Share-Based

Compensation

in the Notes for further information related to
    stock options and share-based compensation.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

As described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent
    Pronouncements

in the Notes, there are accounting
    pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet
    been implemented by us.

Note 2

describes the
    potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have
    on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from expected and historical
    results. Other factors besides those listed here also could
    adversely affect us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
    above in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for more information regarding factors that might cause our
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
    the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We depend on the U.S. Government for a significant portion
    of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding could have adverse consequences on
    our future business.

•

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts,
    which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase
    in inflation.

•

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business internationally, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates.

•

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export
    licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may
    prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may affect adversely the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

•

The inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key
    suppliers to timely deliver our components or parts, could cause
    our products to be produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory
    manner.



•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse affect on our financial
    position and results of operations.

•

We are subject to customer credit risk.

•

We face significant risk exposures and potential liabilities
    that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.

•

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

•

Our consolidated financial results may be impacted by Harris
    Stratex Networks’ financial results, which may vary
    significantly and be difficult to forecast.

•

We have significant operations in Florida, California and other
    locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the
    event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

•

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments

and/or

recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in substantial
    losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of
    operations.

•

In order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies
    and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk
    Management” in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” of this Annual Report on

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation (the “Company”)
    is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
    internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
    appropriate cost-benefit analysis, regarding the reliability of
    our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 27,
    2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on management’s assessment and those
    criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    June 27, 2008.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears on page 60 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Harris Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 27, 2008 and
    June 29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, cash flows, and comprehensive income and
    shareholders’ equity, for each of the three years in the
    period ended June 27, 2008. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries at
    June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, and the consolidated
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended June 27, 2008, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
    material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of June 27, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 22, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited Harris Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 27, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Harris
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of June 27, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
    and comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity, for each
    of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2008 of
    Harris Corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated
    August 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
    and its consolidated subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the terms “Harris,”
    “we,” “our” and “us” refer to
    Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
    Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
    eliminated.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
    100 percent of the assets and liabilities of our
    majority-owned subsidiary, Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.
    (“Harris Stratex Networks”), and the 44 percent
    ownership interest of the minority stockholders of Harris
    Stratex Networks is recorded in “Minority interest in
    Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.” in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have
    been eliminated. References to Harris Stratex Networks include
    its consolidated subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates

— The consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These
    estimates are based on experience and other information
    available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial
    statements. Materially different results can occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
    Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006
    all include 52 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
    months when purchased. These investments include accrued
    interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Short-term Investments

— We invest in
    high-quality securities to ensure that cash is readily available
    for use in our current operations. Investments with original
    maturities greater than three months are accounted for in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
    and Equity Securities” (“Statement 115”), and are
    classified accordingly at the time of purchase. At June 27,
    2008, our short-term investments available-for-sale consisted of
    $1.4 million of commercial paper, $1.1 million of
    corporate notes and $0.6 million of certificates of
    deposit. All of the short-term investments available-for-sale
    have maturity dates of less than one year. At June 29,
    2007, our short-term investments available-for-sale consisted of
    $12.8 million of corporate notes, $4.8 million of
    government notes and $2.8 million of investment grade
    auction rate securities.

Marketable Equity Securities

— Marketable
    equity securities available-for-sale are accounted for in
    accordance with Statement 115, and are classified accordingly at
    the time of purchase. We consider all our available-for-sale
    securities as available for use in our current operations. All
    of our marketable equity securities are classified as
    available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with unrealized
    gains and losses, net of tax, included as a separate component
    of shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
    marketable equity securities available-for-sale are determined
    using the specific identification method. In instances where a
    security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the
    security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same
    security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount
    estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an
    “other-than-temporary” impairment is determined to
    exist, the difference between the value of the investment
    security recorded on the financial statements and our current
    estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in
    the period in which the impairment is determined.

The cost basis of marketable equity securities
    available-for-sale at June 27, 2008, consisting primarily
    of shares of common stock of AuthenTec, Inc.
    (“AuthenTec”), was $11.5 million. The cost basis
    of marketable equity securities available-for-sale at
    June 29, 2007, consisting primarily of convertible
    preferred stock and warrants to purchase additional preferred
    stock of AuthenTec, was $13.4 million.

Selected Investments

— Selected investments are
    investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
    fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
    cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
    cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
    requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
    estimate the value of the securities without an independent
    appraisal based upon available information such as projected
    cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
    recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
    and a review of the financial and market conditions of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the underlying company. In fiscal 2007, “Non-operating
    income (loss)” in our Consolidated Statement of Income
    included a write-down of $19.8 million related to our
    investment in Terion, Inc. (“Terion”) due to an
    other-than-temporary impairment in the first quarter of fiscal
    2007, and a $1.8 million gain in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2007 resulting from proceeds received from Terion
    following Terion’s sale of substantially all of its assets
    on January 10, 2007. In fiscal 2006, “Non-operating
    income (loss)” in our Consolidated Statement of Income
    included a write-down of $4.0 million related to our
    investment in Terion due to an other-than-temporary impairment.
    The write-down was the result of less than expected operating
    results and downward revisions of forecasted future results. As
    a result of our receipt of proceeds from Terion following the
    sale in fiscal year 2007, as described above, we did not have
    any selected investments at June 29, 2007; nor did we have
    any selected investments at June 27, 2008.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
    available-for-sale, marketable equity securities
    available-for-sale, accounts receivable, non-current
    receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term
    and long-term debt approximate their fair values. Fair values
    for long-term debt are based primarily on quoted market prices
    for those or similar instruments. A discussion of fair values
    for our derivative financial instruments is included under the
    caption “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in
    this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
    net realizable value and they do not bear interest. This value
    includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to
    reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances
    which is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We
    calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs,
    level of past due accounts and economic status of the customers.
    We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the
    terms of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are
    recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed
    uncollectible. See

Note 5: Receivables

for
    additional information regarding accounts receivable.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory
    quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and
    obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
    product demand and production requirements. See

Note 6:
    Inventories

for additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of
    buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
    straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
    lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 45 years.
    The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
    range between 2 and 10 years. Software capitalized for
    internal use is accounted for in accordance with the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”).

Amortization of internal-use software begins when the software
    is put into service and is based on the expected useful life of
    the software. The useful lives over which we amortize
    internal-use software generally range between 2 and
    7 years. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

for additional information regarding property, plant and
    equipment.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess cost
    of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
    acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets” (“Statement 142”), indefinite-life
    identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
    Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
    perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
    impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
    which we define as our business segments, with its total assets,
    including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets
    as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
    its adjusted total assets, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted total assets of a reporting
    unit exceed its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
    The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized
    intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
    a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
    was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill

for additional information
    regarding goodwill.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

— We assess the recoverability of the
    carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
    intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
    assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
    such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
    flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
    undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
    the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between
    the fair value and the carrying amount. Identifiable intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
    lives. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

and

Note 9: Identifiable Intangible Assets

for
    additional information regarding long-lived assets and
    identifiable intangible assets.

Capitalized Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed

— Capitalized software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed is accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, “Accounting
    for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
    Otherwise Marketed” (“Statement 86”). Costs
    incurred to acquire or create a computer software product are
    expensed when incurred as research and development until
    technological feasibility has been established for the product,
    at which point such costs are capitalized. Technological
    feasibility is normally established upon completion of a
    detailed program design. Capitalization of computer software
    costs ceases when the product is available for general release
    to customers. Costs of reproduction, documentation, training
    materials, physical packaging, maintenance and customer support
    are charged to cost of products sold as incurred. Capitalized
    software is evaluated for impairment periodically by comparing
    the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product
    to the net realizable value of that product. In the third
    quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an $18.9 million
    write-down of capitalized software in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. The write-down was a result of
    management’s decision to discontinue an automation software
    development effort. This write-down is included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item of our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Capitalized software accounted for under Statement 86 had a net
    carrying value of $51.9 million at June 27, 2008 and
    $41.0 million at June 29, 2007. Total amortization
    expense related to these capitalized software amounts for fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.7 million, $4.1 million and
    $2.2 million, respectively. The annual amortization of
    capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed
    using (a) the ratio that current gross revenues for a
    product bear to the total of current and anticipated future
    gross revenues for that product or (b) the straight-line
    method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
    product. Based on this policy, the useful lives over which we
    amortize costs of computer software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed range from three years to seven years.
    Amortization commences when the product is available for general
    release to customers. The capitalized costs, net of accumulated
    amortization, are reflected in the “Other non-current
    assets” line item of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
    amortization of capitalized software is included in the
    “Cost of product sales” line item of our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No current
    assets other than those already set forth in the line items of
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our
    total current assets as of June 27, 2008 or June 29,
    2007. No assets within the “Other non-current assets”
    line item of our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded
    5 percent of total assets as of June 27, 2008 or
    June 29, 2007. No accrued liabilities or expenses within
    the line items “Other accrued items” or “Other
    long-term liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    exceeded 5 percent of our total current liabilities or
    total liabilities, respectively, as of June 27, 2008 or
    June 29, 2007. Also, see the caption
    “Reclassifications” in this

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

for additional information
    regarding other assets and liabilities.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
    tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
    deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
    timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
    tax planning strategies. See

Note 22: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production
    contract sales in our Defense Communications and Electronics and
    Government Communications Systems segments, the value or price
    of our warranty is generally included in the contract and funded
    by the customer. A provision for warranties is built into the
    estimated program costs when determining the profit rate to
    accrue when applying the cost-to-cost percentage of completion
    revenue recognition



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are charged to the specific
    program’s cost, and both revenue and cost are recognized at
    that time. Factors that affect the estimated program cost for
    warranties include terms of the contract, complexity of the
    delivered product or service, number of installed units,
    historical experience and management’s judgment regarding
    anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim.

On product sales in our Defense Communications and Electronics,
    Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks segments,
    we provide for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The
    specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending
    upon the product sold and country in which we do business. In
    the case of products sold by us, our warranties start from the
    shipment or delivery date and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

Defense Communications and Electronics

One to twelve years

Broadcast Communications

One to five years

Harris Stratex Networks

Two to three years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
    customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
    those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
    warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, historical experience and
    management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
    warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
    our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
    adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
    Communications segment and network management software products
    sold by our Harris Stratex Networks segment generally carry a
    30- to

90-day

warranty from the date of customer acceptance. Our liability
    under these warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of
    any portion of the software found not to be in substantial
    compliance with the agreed upon specifications, or to provide a
    full refund.

Software license agreements and sales contracts for other
    products in our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex
    Networks segments generally include provisions for indemnifying
    customers against certain specified liabilities should those
    segments’ products infringe a third party’s
    intellectual property rights. Certain of our Broadcast
    Communications transmission systems customers have notified us
    of potential claims against us based on these standard
    indemnification provisions included in sales contracts between
    us and these customers. These indemnification claims arise from
    litigation brought by a third party patent licensing company
    asserting alleged technology rights against these customers. We
    are cooperating with these customers in efforts to mitigate
    their litigation exposure. To date, we have not incurred
    material costs as a result of such indemnification and have not
    accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our
    consolidated financial statements. See

Note 10: Accrued
    Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
    currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
    currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
    of exchange and income and expense items are translated at the
    weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

—
    Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2006, we implemented
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“Statement 123R”) for
    all share-based compensation that was not vested as of the end
    of fiscal 2005. In accordance with Statement 123R, we measure
    compensation cost for all share-based payments (including
    employee stock options) at fair value and recognize cost over
    the vesting period. It is our policy to issue shares when
    options are exercised. We have also repurchased shares of our
    common stock to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued
    under our stock incentive plans. See

Note 14: Stock
    Options and Share-Based Compensation

for additional
    information regarding share-based compensation.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
    following revenue recognition policies:

Defense Communications and Electronics
    segment:

Revenue in our Defense Communications
    and Electronics segment relates to development and production
    contracts and to product and services sales. Revenue and
    anticipated profits under development and production contracts
    are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally
    using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales and
    profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to
    estimated total costs at completion. Recognition of profit on
    development and production fixed-price contracts requires
    estimates of: the total contract value; the total cost at
    completion; and the measurement of progress towards



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

completion. Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable contracts
    are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract,
    and become billable to the customer, in an amount equal to the
    allowable costs plus the profit on those costs.

Contracts are combined when specific aggregation criteria stated
    in AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”)

are met. Criteria generally include closely interrelated
    activities performed for a single customer within the same
    economic environment. Contracts generally are not segmented. If
    contracts are segmented, they meet the segmenting criteria
    stated in

SOP 81-1.

Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
    items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
    estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
    and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered
    in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there
    is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
    performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
    solely on a single significant event, are generally not
    recognized until the event occurs. When adjustments in contract
    value or estimated costs are determined, any changes from prior
    estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period.
    Anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are
    charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product sales other than
    development and production contracts and revenue from service
    arrangements, which are recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collection is probable, delivery of a product has occurred, and
    title has transferred or services have been rendered. Further,
    if an arrangement other than a development and production
    contract requires the delivery or performance of multiple
    deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we determine
    whether the individual elements represent “separate units
    of accounting” under the requirements of Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

00-21,

“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”

(“EITF 00-21”).

If the separate elements meet the requirements listed in

EITF 00-21,

we recognize the revenue associated with each element separately
    and contract revenue is allocated among elements based on
    relative fair value. If the elements within a bundled sale are
    not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an
    individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
    are undelivered elements that are essential to the
    functionality. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized
    by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts.
    Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance
    exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless
    these obligations are satisfied.

Government Communications Systems
    segment:

Revenue in our Government Communications
    Systems segment relates to development and production contracts
    and to product and services sales. Revenue recognition from
    development and production contracts and product and services
    sales follows the same policies as stated under our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment’s revenue
    recognition policy above.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in
    our Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to
    product and services sales and software licenses. Revenue
    recognition from development and production contracts and
    product and services sales follows the same policies as stated
    under our Defense Communications and Electronics segment’s
    revenue recognition policy above. This segment derives a portion
    of its revenue from the licensing of software with multi-year
    maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue allocated to
    undelivered elements under these bundled software licenses is
    based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual
    method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as
    indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as
    unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements
    is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned
    revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a
    straight-line basis over the maintenance agreement.

Harris Stratex Networks segment:

Revenue in
    our Harris Stratex Networks segment primarily relates to product
    and services sales. Revenue recognition from development and
    production contracts and product and services sales follows the
    same policies as stated under our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment’s revenue recognition policy above.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a
    component of “Non-operating income (loss)” on our
    Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis
    of terms specified in contractual agreements. Shipping and
    handling fees billed to customers are classified on our
    Consolidated Statement of Income as “Revenue from product
    sales” and the associated costs are classified in
    “Cost of product sales.” Also, we record taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from
    revenues.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Retirement Benefits

— As of June 27, 2008,
    we provide retirement benefits to substantially all

U.S.-based

employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
    plan having matching and savings elements. Contributions by us
    to the retirement plan are based on employees’ savings with
    no other funding requirements. Fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006
    retirement plans included a profit sharing component of
    $39.4 million and $48.6 million, respectively. We may
    make additional contributions to the plan at our discretion.
    Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited healthcare
    plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and employees on long-term disability. We accrue the
    estimated cost of these medical benefits, which are not
    material, during an employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expenses amounted to $37.1 million in
    fiscal 2008, $86.0 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $103.9 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2008 profit sharing
    under our performance reward plan is recorded as compensation
    expense.

Minority Interest

— Minority interest
    represents the minority stockholders’ proportionate share
    of equity and net income or net loss of Harris Stratex Networks.
    As of June 27, 2008, the minority stockholders’
    proportionate share of the equity in Harris Stratex Networks of
    $330.3 million is reflected as “Minority interest in
    Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. The minority stockholders’ proportionate share of
    net loss was $7.2 million for fiscal 2008 and
    $10.5 million for fiscal 2007.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
    environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
    of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
    contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
    existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
    costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 17 sites
    where future liabilities could exist. These sites include 2
    sites owned by us, 7 sites associated with our former graphics
    or semiconductor locations and 8 treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
    attributable to us from past operations. Based on an assessment
    of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
    liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”) and other environmental statutes and
    regulations for identified sites, using an 8.5 percent
    discount rate, is approximately $5.1 million. The current
    portion of this liability is included in “Other accrued
    items” and the non-current portion is included in
    “Other long-term liabilities” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that
    will be incurred over the next 15 to 20 years (depending on
    the number of years for each site) is approximately
    $8.5 million. The expected payments for the next five years
    are: fiscal 2009 — $0.8 million; fiscal
    2010 — $1.0 million; fiscal 2011 —
    $1.1 million; fiscal 2012 — $0.6 million;
    fiscal 2013 — $0.6 million; and the aggregate
    amount thereafter is approximately $4.4 million. The
    relevant factors we considered in estimating our potential
    liabilities under the Superfund Act and other environmental
    statutes and regulations include cost-sharing agreements with
    other parties and the potential indemnification from successor
    and predecessor owners of these sites. We do not believe that
    uncertainties with respect to these relevant factors would
    materially affect our potential liability under the Superfund
    Act and other environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
    Commitments

— Guarantees are contingent
    commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
    a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
    paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. At
    June 27, 2008, there are no such contingent commitments,
    nor are any guarantees accrued for in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. At June 27, 2008, we had total
    commercial commitments, including debt and performance
    guarantees, of $133.1 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

—
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“Statement 133”) requires us to
    recognize all derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
    fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
    depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value
    of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair
    value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through
    earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
    hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion
    of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately
    recognized in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a combination of
    foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts
    to hedge against risks associated with anticipated cash flows
    that are probable to occur in



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the future and cash flows that are fixed or firmly committed.
    These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
    of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
    anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
    effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
    anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
    used to hedge these cash flows. We do not hold or issue
    derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge against the
    currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with
    anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
    occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
    Statement 133, such financial instruments are marked-to-market
    using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to
    other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. The
    foreign currency options and forward contracts are subsequently
    recognized as a component of “Cost of product sales”
    on our Consolidated Statement of Income when the underlying net
    cash flows are realized. Unrealized losses are recorded in
    “Other accrued items” on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of
    hedge ineffectiveness. Unrealized gains are recorded as
    “Other assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet with
    the offset to other comprehensive income, net of hedge
    ineffectiveness. The cash flow impact of our derivatives are
    included in the same category on our Consolidated Statement of
    Cash Flows as the cash flows of the item being hedged.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
    by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
    based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single
    counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
    position with each counterparty. In the event of the termination
    of a derivative designated as a hedge, the settlement would be
    charged to our Consolidated Statement of Income as a component
    of “Non-operating income (loss).”

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is
    based upon the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during each year. See

Note 15: Net Income
    Per Diluted Share

for additional information regarding net
    income per share.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements
    to conform with current-year classifications. These
    reclassifications include:

•

Reclassifying $67.3 million of prepaid expenses, advances
    and sundry receivables from the line item “Other
    non-current assets” to the line item “Other current
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    June 29, 2007;

•

Reclassifying $28.7 million and $18.6 million of
    share-based compensation expense from the line item
    “Other” to the line item “Share-based
    compensation” within the “Operating Activities”
    section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal
    years 2007 and 2006, respectively; and

•

Reclassifying $43.1 million and $57.7 million of
    revenue from the line item “Revenue from services” to
    the line item “Revenue from product sales” within our
    Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal years 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

NOTE 2:

ACCOUNTING
    CHANGES OR RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which sets out a consistent framework
    for preparers to use to determine the appropriate level of tax
    reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This
    interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“Statement 109”) uses a two-step approach wherein a
    tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not
    to be sustained. The amount of the benefit to be recognized is
    the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being ultimately sustained. FIN 48 also sets
    out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an
    entity’s tax reserves. We implemented FIN 48 effective
    June 30, 2007, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2008.
    See

Note 22 — Income Taxes

for information
    regarding the impact on our financial position of implementing
    FIN 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“Statement 158”), which amends FASB
    Statements No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions;” No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
    Plans and for Termination Benefits;” No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions;” and
    No. 132(R), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefits.” In the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, we adopted the portion of Statement 158 that
    requires the recognition and disclosure of overfunded or
    underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as
    an asset or liability as described in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for our fiscal year ended June 29, 2007. Statement 158 also
    requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as
    of the date of the employer’s year-end balance sheet, with
    limited exceptions. This portion of Statement 158 is effective
    for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, which for
    us is our fiscal 2009, which ends July 3, 2009. Certain of
    our plans currently have measurement dates that do not coincide
    with our fiscal year end and thus we will be required to change
    their measurement dates in fiscal 2009. We do not currently
    anticipate that the change in measurement dates will materially
    impact our financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“Statement 157”). Statement 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 applies
    under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value
    measurement in which the FASB concluded that fair value was the
    relevant measurement, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. Statement 157 is effective for financial assets
    and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, which for us is our fiscal 2009. In
    February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which
    defers the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010.
    We do not currently anticipate that the implementation of
    Statement 157 will materially impact our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“Statement 159”). Statement 159 allows companies to
    voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure many
    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value (the
    “fair value option”). The election is made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
    for an instrument, all unrealized gains or losses in fair value
    for that instrument shall be reported in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal
    years that begin after November 15, 2007, which for us is
    our fiscal 2009. We do not currently plan to elect the fair
    value option.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business
    Combinations” (“Statement 141R”). Statement 141R
    requires that, upon a business combination, the acquired assets,
    assumed liabilities, contractual contingencies and contingent
    liabilities, be recognized and measured at their fair value at
    the acquisition date. Statement 141R also requires that
    acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the
    acquisition and expensed as incurred. In addition, Statement
    141R requires that acquired in-process research and development
    be measured at fair value and capitalized as an indefinite-lived
    intangible asset, and it is therefore not subject to
    amortization until the project is completed or abandoned.
    Statement 141R also requires that changes in deferred tax asset
    valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties that
    are recognized after the measurement period be recognized in
    income tax expense. Statement 141R is to be applied
    prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
    after December 15, 2008, which for us will be our fiscal
    2010. Thus, while adoption is not expected to materially impact
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows
    directly when it becomes effective on July 4, 2009 (the
    beginning of our fiscal 2010), it is expected to have a
    significant effect on the accounting for any acquisitions we
    make subsequent to that date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB No. 51” (“Statement 160”).
    Statement 160 requires that noncontrolling interests (previously
    referred to as minority interests) be clearly identified and
    presented as a component of equity, separate from the
    parent’s equity. Statement 160 also requires that the
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
    to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income;
    that changes in ownership interest be accounted for as equity
    transactions; and that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any
    retained noncontrolling equity investment in that subsidiary and
    the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of that subsidiary be
    measured at fair value. Statement 160 is to be applied
    prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure
    requirements (which are to be applied retrospectively for all
    periods presented) and is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010.
    We are currently evaluating the impact Statement 160 may
    have on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133” (“Statement 161”).
    Statement 161 applies to all derivative instruments, including
    bifurcated derivative instruments (and to nonderivative
    instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
    instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of Statement
    133) and related hedged items accounted for under Statement 133.
    Statement 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of
    Statement 133 to provide greater transparency as to (a) how
    and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
    for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and
    (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. To meet those objectives, Statement
    161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and
    strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about
    the volume of derivative activity and fair value amounts of, and
    gains and losses on, derivative instruments including location
    of such amounts in the consolidated financial statements, and
    disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in
    derivative agreements. Statement 161 is effective for fiscal
    years and interim periods that begin after November 15,
    2008, which for us is the third quarter of our fiscal 2009. We
    do not currently anticipate the implementation of Statement 161
    will materially impact our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. Emerging Issues Task

Force (“EITF”) 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”

(“FSP 03-6-1”).

FSP 03-6-1 states

that unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and,
    accordingly, should be included in the two-class method of
    calculating earnings per share (“EPS”) under FASB
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
    “Earnings per Share.”

FSP 03-6-1

also includes guidance on allocating earnings pursuant to the
    two-class method.

FSP 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010. All prior-period EPS data
    presented (including interim financial statements, summaries of
    earnings, and selected financial data) shall be adjusted
    retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact

FSP 03-6-1

may have on our financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determining the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

(“FSP 142-3”).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal
    or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of
    recognized intangible assets accounted for pursuant to Statement
    142.

FSP 142-3

amends Statement 142 to require an entity to consider its own
    historical experience in renewing or extending similar
    arrangements, regardless of whether those arrangements have
    explicit renewal or extension provisions. In the absence of such
    experience,

FSP 142-3

requires an entity to consider assumptions that market
    participants would use (consistent with the highest and best use
    of the asset by market participants), adjusted for
    entity-specific factors.

FSP 142-3

also requires incremental disclosures for renewable intangible
    assets.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010. This FSP is to be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective
    date, and the incremental disclosure requirements for renewable
    intangible assets are to be applied prospectively to all
    intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the
    effective date.

NOTE 3:

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2007 we made the following business combinations:

•

We combined our former Microwave Communications Division with
    Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Stratex”), a publicly-traded
    provider of high-speed wireless transmission systems, to
    form Harris Stratex Networks. Pursuant to the combination
    with Stratex, each share of Stratex common stock was converted
    into one-fourth of a share of Harris Stratex Networks
    Class A common stock. As a result of the transaction,
    24,782,153 shares of Harris Stratex Networks Class A
    common stock were issued to the former holders of Stratex common
    stock and Stratex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harris
    Stratex Networks. In the combination transaction, we contributed
    the assets of our Microwave Communications Division, including
    $32.1 million in cash, and, in exchange Harris Stratex
    Networks assumed substantially all of the liabilities related to
    our Microwave Communications Division and issued
    32,913,377 shares of Harris Stratex Networks Class B
    common stock to us. As a result of these transactions, we
    initially owned approximately 57 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock and the minority stockholders
    owned approximately 43 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock. Harris Stratex Networks is a
    publicly-traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under
    the symbol “HSTX.” Harris Stratex Networks results of
    operations, which include Stratex results of operations, have
    been included in our Consolidated Statement of Income and

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows since the combination date
    of January 26, 2007, with appropriate elimination of the
    minority interest. See additional information in

    Ownership in Harris Stratex Networks

.

The Stratex combination was accounted for as a purchase business
    combination with us considered to be the purchaser for
    accounting purposes, and resulted in a gain to us of
    approximately $163.4 million ($143.1 million
    after-tax), which relates to the deemed sale of 43 percent
    of the assets and liabilities of our former Microwave
    Communications Division to the minority stockholders of Harris
    Stratex Networks. The gain on the combination with Stratex was
    calculated as follows (in millions):

Gain on the combination with Stratex

The fair value of Harris Microwave Communications Division
    assets and liabilities was determined based on the fair value of
    Stratex shares received as this amount was more readily
    measurable as Stratex was a publicly-traded company. The
    $281.3 million fair value of Stratex was calculated based
    on the market capitalization of Stratex, using the Stratex stock
    price as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the date of the
    transaction of approximately $493 million, multiplied by
    57 percent (the percentage of Harris Stratex Networks
    owned by Harris). The $117.9 million contribution of Harris
    Microwave Communications Division assets and liabilities was the
    historical book value of the Microwave Communications Division
    multiplied by the 43 percent deemed sold to the former
    shareholders of Stratex.

Additional details, including the calculation of the purchase
    price, identifiable intangible assets and Stratex’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition date, are
    provided in the table and notes below.

As of June 27, 2008, we owned approximately 56 percent
    of Harris Stratex Networks.

•

Multimax Incorporated (“Multimax”), a privately-held
    provider of information technology and communications services
    for the U.S. Government. The June 15, 2007 acquisition
    of Multimax significantly expanded our information technical
    services business — providing greater scale, a broader
    customer base and new growth opportunities through key positions
    on Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts. We purchased Multimax
    for $402 million in cash. Additional details, including
    calculation of the purchase price, identifiable intangible
    assets and Multimax’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the
    acquisition date, are provided in the table and notes below.

During fiscal 2006 we made the following business combinations:

•

Leitch Technology Corporation (“Leitch”), a
    publicly-held provider of high-performance video systems for the
    television broadcast industry, was acquired for a total purchase
    price of $444.5 million. We recorded $87.9 million of
    identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a
    weighted average life of 7.7 years.

•

Optimal Solutions, Inc. (“OSi”), a privately-held
    provider of air-time sales, traffic and billing software systems
    to over 350 call-letter broadcast stations in North America, was
    acquired for a total purchase price of $31.3 million. We
    recorded $10.7 million of identifiable intangible assets
    that are being amortized over a weighted average life of
    8.0 years.

•

Aastra Digital Video, a business unit of Aastra Technologies
    Limited. Aastra Digital Video develops and markets video
    networking, encoding, decoding and multiplexing technologies
    used by television broadcasters, telecommunications providers
    and satellite networks, and was acquired for a total purchase
    price of $34.8 million. We recorded $8.6 million of
    identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a
    weighted average life of 6.9 years.

In connection with the combination with Stratex, we allocated
    $15.3 million of the purchase price to in-process research
    and development projects. These allocations represent the
    estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the
    combination, the development of these projects had not yet
    reached technological feasibility and the in-process research
    and development had no alternative future uses. Accordingly,
    these costs were expensed as a charge to earnings and are
    included in the line item “Engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses.” In making these purchase price
    allocations we relied on present value calculations of income,
    an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and
    an assessment of overall contribution and project risk. The
    value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
    development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
    the purchased in-process research and development into
    commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
    to their present value using a discount rate of 19 percent.
    The Stratex projects were for the development of the next
    generation of the Eclipse product (“Next Generation
    Eclipse”). The Next Generation Eclipse product is expected
    to incorporate significant modifications to address
    carrier-grade Ethernet functionality. The functionality in the
    planned product is expected to represent the first significant
    jump related to capacity and capability associated with packet
    switching. As of the valuation date, this project was
    approximately 50 percent complete with initial product
    release in late calendar 2007 and had remaining costs until
    completion of approximately $3.4 million.

All of these business combinations have been accounted for under
    the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, their
    results of operations have been included in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
    since their acquisition and combination dates. The purchase
    prices of the Stratex combination and the Multimax, Leitch, OSi
    and Aastra Digital Video acquisitions give effect to
    post-closing adjustments. The consideration given to the former
    shareholders and option holders of Stratex was newly issued
    shares of Harris Stratex Networks. The cash consideration given
    to the former shareholders and option holders of Multimax was
    initially funded using $400.0 million of commercial paper
    backed by our credit facility, which was subsequently refinanced
    with our $400 million 5.95% notes, due fiscal 2018.
    The goodwill resulting from all these acquisitions and
    combinations was associated primarily with the acquired
    companies’ market presence and leading positions, growth
    opportunities in the markets in which the acquired companies
    operated, and experienced work forces and established operating
    infrastructures. The goodwill resulting from the Stratex
    combination and the Multimax, Leitch and OSi acquisitions is not
    deductible for tax purposes while the goodwill related to the
    Aastra Digital Video acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
    The write-offs of in-process research and development noted in
    the above table were included in the line item
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” on
    our Consolidated Statement of Income.

There was a $9.0 million additional payment due to the
    former owners of OSi based on certain financial performance
    criteria that were met in fiscal 2007. Accordingly, we increased
    goodwill and recorded a liability in fiscal 2007. This
    obligation was paid during fiscal 2008.

    unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the business
    combination with Stratex and acquisition of Multimax had been

    after including the impact of adjustments such as amortization
    of intangible assets, interest expense on related borrowings,
    and the related income tax effects. This pro forma presentation
    does not include any impact of transaction synergies.

OWNERSHIP
    IN HARRIS STRATEX NETWORKS

Harris Stratex Networks is authorized to issue and has issued
    both Class A common stock and Class B common stock. We
    own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Class B
    common stock. The Class B common stock has the same rights
    and privileges as, and ranks equally and shares ratably with,
    the Class A common stock, and otherwise is substantially
    similar to the Class A common stock, except that holders of
    shares of Class B common stock have certain additional
    rights, several of which are generally described below.

Holders of Class B common stock have the right to vote
    separately as a class to elect a number of Harris Stratex
    Networks directors (the “Class B Directors”)
    equal to such holders’ proportionate ownership of the total
    voting power of the outstanding Harris Stratex Networks common
    stock (and to remove and replace such Class B Directors) so
    long as such holders’ total voting power is equal to or
    greater than 10 percent. Also, subject to limited
    exceptions, holders of Class B common stock have a
    preemptive right to preserve their proportionate interest in
    Harris Stratex Networks, but only when the holders of
    Class B common stock hold a majority of the total number of
    votes entitled to be cast generally in an election of the
    directors of Harris Stratex Networks (other than an election of
    the Class B Directors).

We have agreed that until January 26, 2009 we will not
    acquire or dispose of any of our voting securities in Harris
    Stratex Networks, unless (i) pursuant to our preemptive
    right described above, (ii) approved in advance by a
    majority of the Harris Stratex Networks directors who are not
    Class B directors (the “Class A Directors”),
    or (iii) as a result of actions taken by Harris Stratex
    Networks that do not increase or decrease our percentage of
    total voting power which we and our affiliates are entitled to
    cast in respect of all classes of capital stock or securities of
    Harris Stratex Networks then outstanding and entitled to
    vote generally in the election of Class A Directors
    (including the holders of Class B common stock)
    beneficially owned by us. We have also agreed that from
    January 26, 2009 to January 26, 2011, we will not
    (1) beneficially own more than 80 percent of the
    voting power of Harris Stratex Networks without the prior
    approval of a majority of the Class A Directors or
    (2) transfer all or a portion of our interest in Harris
    Stratex Networks to a person if, following such transfer, that
    person would be entitled to cast a majority of the outstanding
    votes in an election of the directors of Harris Stratex Networks
    (other than an election of the Class B Directors) unless a
    majority of the Class A Directors approves such transfer in
    advance or the person purchasing our interest in Harris Stratex
    Networks offers to acquire all the outstanding voting securities
    of Harris Stratex Networks at the same price and on the same
    terms as apply to the transfer from us. We are permitted to
    issue a pro-rata dividend of our shares of Harris Stratex
    Networks to our shareholders and to sell our Harris Stratex
    Networks shares to the public in a registered secondary public
    offering. Shares of Class A common stock currently are
    listed for trading on NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol
    “HSTX,” while shares of Class B common stock
    currently are not listed for trading on any exchange or
    quotation system.

Broadcast
    Communications Segment

During the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006, the
    Broadcast Communications segment took cost-reduction actions to
    address ongoing weakness in our international broadcast
    transmission markets and to further improve the segment’s
    profitability. In connection with these actions,
    $12 million of inventory was written down during fiscal
    2006 related to discontinued products.

Harris
    Stratex Networks Segment

As a result of accelerated technology transition to

IP-based

products, $11 million of inventory was written down during
    fiscal 2008. Additionally, in fiscal 2008, a non-cash accounting
    adjustment of approximately $12 million was made to reduce
    inventory related to reconciling inventory

work-in-process

accounts within a cost accounting system at one location
    primarily due to project cost variances that were not recorded
    to cost of sales in a timely manner.

In fiscal 2006, approximately $34 million of inventory was
    written down related to discontinued products at Montreal,
    Canada; Redwood Shores, California; San Antonio, Texas;
    Paris, France; Mexico City, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and

Business Segments

,
    effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we made certain
    changes to our organizational structure which resulted in
    changes to our business segments, and changes in the goodwill
    balances by business segment as presented below. For those
    changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, we applied the
    relative fair value method to determine the reallocation of
    goodwill to reporting units. Statement 142 requires that
    goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and when

NOTE 11:

CREDIT
    ARRANGEMENTS

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans and letters of credit issuances at any time
    and from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement,
    in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
    exceed $500 million (we may request an increase, not to
    exceed an additional $250 million). The Credit Agreement
    may be used for working capital and other general corporate
    purposes and to support any commercial paper that we may issue.
    At our election, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear
    interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the
    base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the
    higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50 percent or
    SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced prime lending rate. The
    Credit Agreement provides that the interest rate margin over
    LIBOR, currently set at 0.40 percent, will increase or
    decrease within certain limits based on changes in the ratings
    of our senior, unsecured long-term debt securities. We are also
    permitted to request borrowings with interest rates and terms
    that are to be set pursuant to competitive bid procedures or
    directly negotiated with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
    consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
    transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
    of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
    prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
    capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
    consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
    from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
    period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
    including: payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
    and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
    warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
    amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
    more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
    debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
    immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the Credit



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Agreement are due and mature on March 31, 2010, unless the
    commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or if
    certain events of default occur. At June 27, 2008, no
    borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
    potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $2.7 million from various international banks,
    $2.4 million of which was available on June 27, 2008.
    These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
    typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
    terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and us, and are
    reviewed annually for renewal or modification. These lines do
    not require compensating balances. We also have a short-term
    commercial paper program in place, which we may utilize to
    satisfy short-term cash requirements and which is supported by
    our Credit Agreement. No amounts were outstanding under our
    commercial paper program at June 27, 2008.

NOTE 12:

SHORT-TERM
    DEBT

We had short-term debt of $8.5 million at June 27,
    2008 which consisted primarily of Harris Stratex Networks
    redeemable preference shares. The short-term debt at
    June 29, 2007 was $410 million which consisted
    primarily of commercial paper. The weighted-average interest
    rate for our short-term debt was 11.7 percent at
    June 27, 2008 and 5.7 percent at June 29, 2007.

The potential maturities of long-term debt, including the
    current portion, for the five years following fiscal 2008 and,
    in total, thereafter are: $5.7 million in fiscal 2009;
    $4.5 million in fiscal 2010; $0.7 million in fiscal
    2011; $0.6 million in fiscal 2012; $0.2 million in
    fiscal 2013; and $825.8 million thereafter. All of our
    outstanding long-term debt is unsubordinated and unsecured with
    equal ranking, except that the debt issued by Stratex under the
    Terminated Facility described below is debt of Harris Stratex
    Networks Operating Corporation, and by Harris Stratex Networks
    under the New Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility described
    below is debt of Harris Stratex Networks and certain of its
    subsidiaries, and is not guaranteed by us.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

defined, plus 30 basis points. In each case, we will pay
    accrued interest on the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed to the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of
    control combined with a below-investment-grade rating event, we
    may be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a
    price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal
    amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on the
    notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. In conjunction with
    the issuance of the notes, we entered into treasury lock
    agreements to protect against fluctuations in forecasted
    interest payments resulting from the issuance of ten-year, fixed
    rate debt due to changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury
    rate. In accordance with Statement 133, these agreements were
    determined to be highly effective in offsetting changes in
    forecasted interest payments as a result of changes in the
    benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these
    agreements on December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of
    $5.5 million, net of income tax, in shareholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    This loss, on a pre-tax basis, along with $5.0 million in
    debt issuance costs, will be amortized over the life of the
    notes on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
    interest rate method, and reflected as a portion of interest
    expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due August
    2022. On July 12, 2007, we initiated the steps necessary to
    redeem the debentures on August 20, 2007. However, prior to
    the date set for redemption, all of the debentures were
    converted by the holders into shares of our common stock at a
    conversion rate of 44.2404 shares of common stock for each
    $1,000 principal amount of debentures, with the exception of
    debentures in the principal amount of $3,000. This resulted in
    the issuance by us of 6,594,146 shares of common stock
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in respect of the
    debentures converted. On August 20, 2007, we redeemed the
    remaining debentures in the principal amount of $3,000.
    Accordingly, no debentures remained outstanding as of
    August 20, 2007. We incurred $4.8 million in debt
    issuance costs related to the issuance of the convertible
    debentures, which costs were amortized on a straight-line basis
    over a five-year period and reflected as a portion of interest
    expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures
    pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the option of the
    holders of the debentures. We may redeem the remaining
    $25.8 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures
    in whole, or in part, at any time at a pre-determined redemption
    price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

Prior to the combination with Stratex, Stratex was a party to a
    credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, and following the
    combination, Stratex (now named “Harris Stratex Networks
    Operating Corporation” and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Harris Stratex Networks), remained a party to the credit
    facility with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Harris Stratex
    Networks Credit Facility”). As discussed below, the Harris
    Stratex Networks Credit Facility (the “Terminated
    Facility”) was terminated and replaced after the end of our
    fiscal 2008. Harris and its subsidiaries (other than Harris
    Stratex Networks Operating Corporation) are not and were not
    parties to, obligated under or guarantors of the Terminated
    Facility. Indebtedness under the Terminated Facility is
    reflected as of June 27, 2008 in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as a result of the consolidation of Harris Stratex
    Networks. The Terminated Facility allowed for revolving credit
    borrowings of up to $50 million. As of June 27, 2008,
    the balance of the term loan portion of the Terminated Facility
    was $8.7 million (of which $5.0 million is recorded in
    the current portion of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

long-term debt) and there was $8.6 million in outstanding
    standby letters of credit. The Terminated Facility agreement
    contained a minimum tangible net worth covenant and a liquidity
    ratio covenant.

On June 30, 2008, after the end of our fiscal 2008, the
    Terminated Facility was terminated and replaced with a new
    revolving credit facility as of that date with a syndicate of
    lenders including Silicon Valley Bank (the “New Harris
    Stratex Networks Credit Facility”). Harris and its
    subsidiaries (other than Harris Stratex Networks and certain of
    its subsidiaries) are not parties to, obligated under or
    guarantors of the New Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility.
    The balance of the term loan portion of the Terminated Facility
    of $8.7 million was repaid in full with the proceeds of a
    $10 million borrowing under the New Harris Stratex
    Networks Credit Facility. The standby letters of credit
    outstanding under the Terminated Facility as of the termination
    date remain as an obligation to Silicon Valley Bank. The New
    Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility provides for an initial
    committed amount of $70 million with an uncommitted
    accordion option for an additional $50 million available
    with the same or additional lenders. The New Harris Stratex
    Networks Credit Facility has an initial term of three years and
    provides for (1) demand borrowings (with no stated maturity
    date) at the greater of Bank of America’s prime rate and
    the federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, (2) fixed
    term Eurodollar loans for six months or more as agreed with
    the banks at LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.25 percent to
    2.00 percent based on the current leverage ratio of Harris
    Stratex Networks and its consolidated subsidiaries, and
    (3) the issuance of standby or commercial letters of
    credit. The New Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility contains
    a minimum liquidity ratio covenant and a maximum leverage ratio
    covenant and is unsecured.

NOTE 14:

STOCK
    OPTIONS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of June 27, 2008, we had three shareholder-approved
    employee stock incentive plans under which options or other
    share-based compensation was outstanding, and we had the
    following types of share-based awards outstanding under these
    plans: stock options, performance share awards, performance
    share unit awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock
    unit awards. Former Harris employees who are now employed with
    Harris Stratex Networks and who had options or awards under
    these plans that were outstanding at the date of the combination
    are included in these plans (“Harris Plans”).
    Additionally, Harris Stratex Networks had a stock incentive plan
    that provides for stock options, restricted stock awards and
    performance share awards based on Harris Stratex Networks
    Class A common stock. Harris Stratex Networks also assumed
    all of the former Stratex outstanding stock options as of
    January 26, 2007, as part of the combination with Stratex
    (“Harris Stratex Networks Plans”). We believe that
    such awards more closely align the interests of our employees
    with those of our shareholders. Certain share-based awards
    provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control
    (as defined under our stock incentive plans).

Harris
    Plans

Shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance
    under Harris Plans totaled 23,515,626 as of June 27, 2008.
    In fiscal 2008, we issued an aggregate of 1,367,588 shares
    of common stock under the terms of Harris Plans, which is net of
    shares withheld for tax purposes.

Stock
    Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under shareholder-approved Harris Plans. Option
    exercise prices are equal to or greater than the fair market
    value of Harris common stock on the date the options are
    granted, using the closing stock price of Harris common stock.
    Options may be exercised for a period set at the time of grant,
    which generally ranges from seven to ten years after the date of
    grant, and they generally become exercisable in installments,
    which are typically 50 percent one year from the grant
    date, 25 percent two years from the grant date and
    25 percent three years from the grant date. A significant
    number of options granted by us in fiscal 2006 are subject to a
    vesting schedule in which they were 50 percent exercisable
    prior to the end of such fiscal year, a period of approximately
    10 months from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which
    uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on
    Harris stock, historical volatility of Harris stock price over
    the last ten years and other factors. The expected term of the
    options is based on historical observations of Harris stock over
    the past ten years, considering average years to exercise for
    all options exercised, average years to cancellation for all
    options cancelled and average years remaining for outstanding
    options, which is calculated based on the weighted-average
    vesting period plus the weighted-average of the difference
    between the vesting period and average years to exercise and
    cancellation. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

    fair value of stock option grants under Harris Plans is as

    options granted under Harris Plans. This cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The
    total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $12.1 million,
    $6.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
    under Harris Plans. The restricted stock and restricted stock
    units are not transferable until vested and the restrictions
    lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a
    specified time period.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
    closing price of Harris stock on the date of grant and is
    amortized to compensation expense over its vesting period. At
    June 27, 2008, there were 372,566 shares of restricted
    stock outstanding.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    June 27, 2008, we had 61,450 restricted stock units
    outstanding.

    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.4 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share
    of restricted stock and per unit of restricted stock units
    granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $57.47, $45.92 and
    $39.45, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that vested during fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006 was approximately $3.5 million, $1.6 million
    and $1.1 million, respectively.

Performance
    Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares and performance share units that have been granted to
    employees under Harris Plans. Generally, performance share and
    performance share unit awards are subject to performance
    criteria such as meeting predetermined earnings and return on
    invested capital targets for a three-year plan period. These
    awards also generally vest at the expiration of the same
    three-year period. The final determination of the number of
    shares to be issued in respect of an award is determined by
    Harris’ Board of Directors or a committee of Harris’
    Board of Directors.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of Harris stock on the date of grant and is amortized to
    compensation expense over its vesting period, if achievement of
    the performance measures is considered probable. At
    June 27, 2008, there were 629,655 performance shares
    outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be

    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.4 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share
    of performance shares and per unit of performance share units
    granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $46.86, $43.88 and

Other

Prior to fiscal 2008, under Harris U.S. retirement plans,
    most

U.S.-based

employees were able to select an option to invest in
    Harris’ common stock at 70 percent of current market
    value limited to the lesser of (a) one percent of their
    eligible compensation and (b) 20 percent of a
    participant’s total contribution to the plan, which was
    matched by us. The discount from fair market value on common
    stock purchased by employees under Harris U.S. retirement
    plans was charged to compensation expense in the period of the
    related purchase. Effective in fiscal 2008, we no longer provide
    a discount to invest in Harris’ common stock.

Harris
    Stratex Networks Plans

As of June 27, 2008, Harris Stratex Networks had one stock
    incentive plan for employees and outside directors, the 2007
    Stock Equity Plan (the “Harris Stratex Networks 2007
    Plan”), which was adopted by the Harris Stratex Networks
    board of directors and approved by Harris as the sole
    shareholder in January 2007. Harris Stratex Networks believes
    that awards under this plan more closely align the interests of
    Harris Stratex Networks employees with those of Harris Stratex
    Networks shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for
    accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined
    under the Harris Stratex Networks 2007 Plan). Shares of Harris
    Stratex Networks Class A common stock remaining available
    for future issuance under the Harris Stratex Networks 2007 Plan
    totaled 4,389,488 as of June 27, 2008. The Harris Stratex
    Networks 2007 Plan provides for the issuance of share-based
    awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards and
    performance share awards.

Harris Stratex Networks also assumed all of the former Stratex
    outstanding stock options as of January 26, 2007, as part
    of the combination with Stratex. For the portion of these
    assumed stock options that were vested at the date of the
    combination with Stratex, Harris Stratex Networks included their
    fair value of $15.5 million as part of the purchase price.
    During fiscal 2007, Harris Stratex Networks also recognized
    $0.9 million in compensation expense related to the
    acceleration of options in connection with the employment
    termination of one of Harris Stratex Networks’ executive
    officers and $0.9 million in compensation cost related to
    the acceleration of options charged to goodwill, both items
    accounted for as modifications under Statement 123R.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock
    Options Awarded — Harris Stratex Networks 2007
    Plan

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under the Harris Stratex Networks 2007 Plan. Option
    exercise prices are equal to the fair market value of Harris
    Stratex Networks Class A common stock on the date the
    options are granted, using the closing price of Harris Stratex
    Networks Class A common stock. Options may be exercised for
    a period set at the time of grant, generally 7 years after
    the date of grant, and they generally vest in installments of
    50 percent one year from the grant date, 25 percent
    two years from the grant date and 25 percent three years
    from the grant date.

The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is used to
    estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The
    determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on
    the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by
    Harris Stratex Networks Class A common stock price as well
    as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
    variables. These variables include the expected term of the
    award, the expected stock price volatility over the expected
    term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate and expected
    dividends. Harris Stratex Networks calculates the expected term
    of option awards using the “Simplified Method” in
    accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 and
    No. 110 due to the short period of its operating history.
    Expected stock price volatility is based on an analysis of
    historical volatility of publicly-traded companies with similar
    characteristics, including industry, size and financial
    leverage. The risk-free interest rate is based on
    U.S. Treasury instruments whose terms are consistent with
    the expected award terms at the grant date. Harris Stratex
    Networks estimates that it will not be paying dividends within
    the expected terms of its option awards. Due to the inherent
    limitations of option-valuation models, including consideration
    of future events that are unpredictable and the estimation
    process utilized in determining the valuation of the share-based
    awards, the ultimate value realized by Harris Stratex Networks
    employees may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in
    our financial statements. For restricted stock awards and
    performance share awards, the grant date fair value is measured
    based upon the closing market price of Harris Stratex Networks
    Class A common stock on the date of the grant.

For stock options and restricted stock awards, Harris Stratex
    Networks recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis
    over the awards’ vesting periods for those awards which
    contain only a service vesting feature. For awards with a
    performance condition vesting feature, when achievement of a
    portion or all of the performance condition is deemed probable,
    Harris Stratex Networks recognizes compensation cost on a
    straight-line basis over the awards’ expected vesting
    periods. Vesting of performance share awards is subject to
    performance criteria including meeting net income and cash flow
    targets for a

29-month

plan period ending July 3, 2009 and continued employment
    through the end of that period. The final determination of the
    number of shares to be issued in respect of an award is
    determined by the Harris Stratex Networks Board of Directors, or
    a committee of Harris Stratex Networks’ Board of Directors.

Statement 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
    of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
    actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Forfeitures
    were estimated based on the historical experience at Stratex for
    those options assumed, and on the historical experience at
    Harris for Harris Stratex Networks employees that were formerly
    employees of Harris’ Microwave Communications Division. For
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 awards, Harris Stratex Networks
    estimated the forfeiture rate to be 5%. Harris Stratex Networks
    expects forfeitures to be 8% annually for the Stratex options
    assumed. Share-based compensation expense was recorded net of
    estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for
    those share-based awards that are expected to vest.

True-ups

of
    forfeiture estimates are made quarterly on a

grant-by-grant

basis.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due August
    2022. Holders of the debentures had the right to convert each of
    their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the
    stated maturity. During fiscal 2008, each holder received
    44.2404 shares of our common stock for each $1,000 of
    debentures surrendered for conversion. This represented a
    conversion price of $22.625 per share of our common stock. All
    outstanding debentures were either converted or redeemed during
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See

Note 13: Long-Term
    Debt

for additional information regarding these debentures.

For purposes of calculating net income per diluted share, the
    numerator has not been adjusted to consider the effect of
    potentially dilutive securities of Harris Stratex Networks
    because the effect would have been antidilutive due to the net
    losses incurred by Harris Stratex Networks during fiscal years
    2008 and 2007.

Potential dilutive common shares primarily consist of employee
    stock options. Employee stock options to purchase approximately
    1,027,350, zero and 20,800 shares of Harris stock at the
    end of fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were
    outstanding, but were not included in the computation of net
    income per diluted share because the effect would have been
    antidilutive as the options’ exercise prices exceeded the
    average market price.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs were $275.0 million in
    fiscal 2008, $234.6 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $197.8 million in fiscal 2006. Customer-sponsored research
    and development costs are incurred pursuant to contractual
    arrangements and are accounted for principally by the
    percentage-of-completion method. Customer-sponsored research and
    development costs incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored
    contracts require us to provide a product or service meeting
    certain defined performance or other specifications (such as
    designs). Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $731.8 million in fiscal 2008, $689.0 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $626.0 million in fiscal 2006.
    Customer-sponsored research and development is included in our
    revenue and cost of product sales and services.

INTEREST
    EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $55.7 million in fiscal 2008,
    $41.1 million in fiscal 2007 and $36.5 million in
    fiscal 2006. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
    major long-term projects can be capitalized as an additional
    cost of the related asset. Interest of $0.1 million was
    capitalized in fiscal 2008. No interest was capitalized in
    fiscal 2007 or in fiscal 2006. Interest paid was
    $56.5 million in fiscal 2008, $39.6 million in fiscal
    2007 and $31.8 million in fiscal 2006.

NOTE 18:

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

We account for leases in accordance with the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases” and other related
    authoritative guidance. Total rental expense amounted to
    $47.1 million in fiscal 2008, $35.5 million in fiscal
    2007 and $30.6 million in fiscal 2006. Future minimum
    rental commitments under leases with an initial lease term in
    excess of one year, primarily for land and buildings, amounted
    to approximately $167.4 million at June 27, 2008.
    These commitments for the years following fiscal 2008 and, in
    total, thereafter are: fiscal 2009 —
    $76.1 million; fiscal 2010 — $32.4 million;
    fiscal 2011 — $20.6 million; fiscal
    2012 — $12.3 million; fiscal 2013 —
    $9.2 million; and $16.8 million thereafter. These
    commitments do not contain any material rent escalations, rent
    holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions, leasehold
    improvement incentives or unusual provisions or conditions. We
    do not consider any of these individual leases material to our
    operations. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception
    of the lease or during the lease term are amortized over the
    current lease term, or estimated life, if shorter.

NOTE 19:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

We use foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
    balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset
    foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments
    from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed
    sales to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use
    of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the
    risks that arise from doing business in international markets.
    At June 27, 2008, we had open foreign exchange contracts
    with a notional amount of $127.8 million, of which
    $49.9 million were classified as cash flow hedges,
    $16.7 million were classified as fair value hedges and
    $61.2 million were not designated hedges under the
    provisions of Statement 133. This compares with total foreign
    exchange contracts with a notional amount of $107.2 million

    provisions of Statement 133. At June 27, 2008, contract
    expiration dates range from less than one month to
    22 months with a weighted average contract life of
    2 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
    cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
    exposures from cash flows anticipated in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment related to customer orders denominated in
    non-functional currencies that are currently in backlog and in
    our Defense Communications and Electronics segment related to
    programs in the U.K., Canada and the Netherlands. We have hedged
    the forecasted cash flows related to payments made to our
    U.S. operations to maintain our anticipated profit margins.
    We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to
    maintain our anticipated profit margins in our international
    operations. As of June 27, 2008, we estimated that a
    pre-tax loss of $1.7 million would be reclassified into net
    income from comprehensive income within the next 12 months
    related to these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
    hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. Amounts
    recognized in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006
    related to the component of the derivative instruments’
    gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
    were also not material. In addition, no amounts were recognized
    in our net income in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to
    hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
    hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
    value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with
    Statement 133.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    $449.3 million of undistributed earnings of international
    subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest these earnings
    indefinitely. Determination of unrecognized deferred
    U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries is not practicable. We have not
    recognized a deferred tax liability for the difference between
    the book basis and the tax basis of our investment in the stock
    of our domestic subsidiaries, related primarily to unremitted
    earnings of subsidiaries, because we do not expect this basis
    difference to become subject to tax at the parent level. We
    believe we can implement certain tax strategies to recover our
    investment in our domestic subsidiaries tax-free. Tax loss and
    credit carryforwards as of June 27, 2008 have expiration
    dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
    instances. The amount of federal, international, and state and
    local tax loss carryforwards as of June 27, 2008 were
    $262.1 million, $235.5 million and $89.0 million,
    respectively. The provision for income taxes did not include any
    benefits attributable to the utilization of certain state net
    operating loss and credit carryforwards in fiscal 2008 or fiscal
    2007 but did include $6.5 million of benefits fiscal 2006.
    Pre-tax income (loss) of international subsidiaries was
    $87.2 million in fiscal 2008, $37.7 million in fiscal
    2007 and $(9.9) million in fiscal 2006. Income taxes paid
    were $212.4 million in fiscal 2008, $160.8 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $90.6 million in fiscal 2006. The valuation
    allowance increased $32.6 million from $167.9 million
    at the end of fiscal 2007 to $200.5 million at the end of
    fiscal 2008. Of the $200.5 million valuation allowance as
    of June 27, 2008, $98.8 million is attributable to
    acquired deferred tax assets, any realization of which will be
    reflected as a change in goodwill. The valuation allowance has
    been established for financial reporting purposes, to offset
    certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due to
    uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the future.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We adopted FIN 48 effective for fiscal 2008 (which began
    June 30, 2007). FIN 48 generally clarifies and sets
    forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain income tax
    positions in accordance with Statement 109. We recognized an
    immaterial cumulative effect adjustment reducing our liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties and
    increasing the June 30, 2007 balance of our retained
    earnings. The adoption also resulted in a reclassification of
    certain tax liabilities from current to non-current. A
    reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

As of June 27, 2008, we had $72.2 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, of which $22.5 million would
    favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax
    benefits are eventually recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. We
    had accrued $5.4 million for the potential payment of
    interest and penalties as of June 30, 2007 (and this amount
    was not included in the $81.2 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits balance at June 30, 2007 shown above) and
    $3.7 million of this total could favorably impact future
    tax rates. We had accrued $2.7 million for the potential
    payment of interest and penalties as of June 27, 2008 (and
    this amount was not included in the $72.2 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits balance at June 27, 2008 shown
    above) and $1.9 million of this total could favorably
    impact future tax rates.

We file numerous separate and consolidated income tax returns
    reporting our financial results and, where appropriate, our
    subsidiaries and affiliates, in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign
    jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2007.
    Pursuant to the Compliance Assurance Process, the IRS is also
    examining fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. We are currently under
    examination by the Canadian Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2003
    through 2007 and appealing portions of a Canadian assessment
    relating to fiscal years 2000 through 2002. We are currently
    under examination by various state and international tax
    authorities for fiscal years ranging from 1990 through 2006. It
    is reasonably possible that there could be a significant
    decrease or increase to our unrecognized tax benefit balance
    during the course of the next twelve months as these
    examinations continue, other tax examinations commence or
    various statutes of limitations expire. An estimate of the range
    of possible changes cannot be made because of the significant
    number of jurisdictions in which we do business and the number
    of open tax periods.

NOTE 23:

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Effective for fiscal 2008 (which began June 30, 2007), our
    Defense Programs area, which was previously included in our
    Government Communications Systems segment, was combined with our
    RF Communications business, and the combined business is
    reported as our Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    for fiscal 2008. Our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex
    Networks segments did not change as a result of the adjustments
    to our organizational structure. The historical results,
    discussion and presentation of our business segments as set
    forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

reflect the impact of these adjustments to our organizational
    structure for all periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We report results of operations for fiscal 2008 in four business
    segments — Defense Communications and Electronics,
    Government Communications Systems, Broadcast Communications and
    Harris Stratex Networks. Our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment is a global supplier of highly secure radio
    communications products and systems for defense and government
    operations; designs, develops and supplies state-of-the-art
    communications and information networks and equipment; and
    conducts advanced research studies, primarily for the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

U.S. Department of Defense and other Federal and state
    agencies, for international customers in government, defense and
    peacekeeping organizations in more than 100 countries, and for
    other aerospace and defense companies. Our Government
    Communications Systems segment develops, designs and supports
    information systems for image and other data collection,
    processing, analysis, interpretation, display, storage and
    retrieval; develops integrated intelligence, surveillance and
    reconnaissance solutions; offers enterprise IT and
    communications engineering, operations and support services; and
    conducts advanced research studies, primarily for a diversified
    group of U.S. Government agencies other than the
    U.S. Department of Defense, for state government agencies
    and for other aerospace and defense companies. Our Broadcast
    Communications segment serves the global digital and analog
    media markets, providing infrastructure and networking products
    and solutions, media and workflow solutions, and television and
    radio transmission equipment and systems. Our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment offers reliable, flexible, scalable and
    cost-efficient wireless transmission network solutions,
    including microwave radio systems and network management
    software, which are backed by comprehensive services and
    support, primarily to mobile and fixed telephone service
    providers, private network operators, government agencies,
    transportation and utility companies, public safety agencies and
    broadcast system operators. Within each of our business
    segments, there are multiple program areas and product lines
    that aggregate into our four business segments described above.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

. We evaluate each segment’s performance based
    on its “operating income (loss),” which we define as
    profit or loss from operations before income taxes and minority
    interest excluding interest income and expense, equity income
    and gains or losses from securities and other investments.
    Intersegment sales among our Defense Communications and
    Electronics, Government Communications Systems and Broadcast
    Communications segments are transferred at cost to the buying
    segment and the sourcing segment recognizes a normal profit that
    is eliminated. Intersegment sales between our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment and any of our Defense Communications and
    Electronics, Government Communications Systems and Broadcast
    Communications segments are recorded as arms length
    transactions. The “Corporate eliminations” line item
    in the tables below represents the elimination of intersegment
    sales and their related profits. The “Headquarters”
    line item in the tables below represents the portion of
    corporate expenses not allocated to the business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
    States with international revenue derived primarily from
    exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
    exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2008,
    2007 or 2006.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all segments
    (primarily our Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    and our Government Communications Systems segment) as a
    percentage of total revenue were 68.3 percent in fiscal
    2008, 65.9 percent in fiscal 2007 and 66.2 percent in
    fiscal 2006. Revenue from services in fiscal 2008 was
    approximately 4.1 percent, 46.0 percent,
    7.7 percent and 15.0 percent of total revenue in our
    Defense Communications and Electronics, Government
    Communications Systems, Broadcast Communications and
    Harris Stratex Networks segments, respectively.

NOTE 24:

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
    of businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
    are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
    related to: product liability; personal injury; patents,
    trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
    commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products
    containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or environmental
    matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
    reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
    of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded
    accruals for losses related to those matters that we consider to
    be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
    contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
    legal costs are expensed when incurred. While it is not feasible
    to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, and some
    lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed or decided
    unfavorably to us, based upon available information, in the
    opinion of management, settlements and final judgments, if any,
    which are considered probable of being rendered against us in
    litigation or arbitration in existence at June 27, 2008 are
    reserved for, covered by insurance or would not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in
    jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result
    in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently
    resolved with the authorities or ultimately through established
    legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any
    ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits;
    however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the
    amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
    Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
    Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness
    of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including
    the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
    overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
    effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
    reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and
    management necessarily is required to use its judgment in
    evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain
    unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these
    entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those
    entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those
    we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. As
    required by

Rule 13a-15

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2008 we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This
    evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. During fiscal 2008, we
    devoted significant effort to comply with the rules on internal
    control over financial reporting issued pursuant to
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This effort
    expanded upon our long-standing practice of acknowledging
    management’s responsibility for the establishment and
    effective operation of internal control through performing
    self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based upon this work
    and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has
    concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2008 our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We
    periodically review our internal control over financial
    reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal
    control over financial reporting to identify potential changes
    to our processes and systems that may improve controls and
    increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an
    effective internal control environment. Changes may include such
    activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
    consolidating the activities of acquired business units,
    migrating certain processes to our shared services
    organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving
    segregation of duties, and adding additional monitoring
    controls. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we
    incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired
    business as part of our integration activities. There have been
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    occurred during the quarter ended June 27, 2008 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

“Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting” is included within
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting was audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our
    independent registered public accounting firm. Their unqualified
    report is included within “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

(d)

Events Relating to Harris Stratex
    Networks.

Following the end of fiscal 2008, our
    majority-owned

publicly-traded

subsidiary, Harris Stratex Networks, reported that due to
    accounting errors, it will restate its financial statements for
    the first three fiscal quarters of its fiscal 2008 (the quarters
    ended March 28, 2008, December 28, 2007 and
    September 28, 2007) and for its fiscal years ended
    June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005.
    Harris Stratex Networks also reported that as a result of
    identifying such accounting errors, it believes there are one or
    more material weaknesses in its system of internal control over
    financial reporting that led to the need to restate its
    financial statements. These events relating to Harris Stratex
    Networks were considered in the Company’s evaluation of its
    internal control over financial reporting, and our management
    concluded that the Company maintained effective disclosure
    controls and procedures as of the end of fiscal 2008 and
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of the
    end of fiscal 2008. The effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries was
    audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered
    public accounting firm, and their unqualified report is included
    within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have been
    advised by Harris Stratex Networks



management that they are confident that all material weaknesses
    that were identified in Harris Stratex Networks’ system of
    internal control over financial reporting will be remediated by
    the end of Harris Stratex Networks’ first quarter of fiscal
    2009. We will continue to evaluate whether the events relating
    to Harris Stratex Networks will require any change in fiscal
    2009 to our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
    control over financial reporting.

Under the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and the

    options, we have granted share-based compensation awards in the
    form of performance shares, restricted stock, performance share
    units, restricted stock units, or other similar types of share
    awards. As of June 27, 2008, there were 1,109,811 such
    awards outstanding under these plans. The outstanding awards
    consisted of (i) 1,002,221 performance share awards and
    restricted stock awards, for which all 1,002,221 shares
    were issued and outstanding; and (ii) 107,590 performance

    associated with performance share awards or restricted stock
    awards or with performance share units awards or restricted
    stock unit awards, all of which are granted to employees at no
    cost, such awards are not included in the weighted average
    exercise price calculation in column (b).
