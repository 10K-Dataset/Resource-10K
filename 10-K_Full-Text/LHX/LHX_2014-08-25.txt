PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is an international communications and
information technology company serving government and commercial markets in more than 125 countries. We are dedicated to developing best-in-class

assured communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets, including RF communications, integrated network solutions and government communications systems.

Harris Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal executive
offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is (321) 727-9100. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HRS.” On June 27, 2014, we
had approximately 14,000 employees. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company” and “Harris” as used in this Report refer to Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.

General

We
structure our operations primarily around the products and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the financial results of our operations in the following three business segments:

Ÿ

RF Communications, serving (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications and (ii) Public Safety and
Professional Communications markets;

Ÿ

Integrated Network Solutions, serving (i) IT Services, (ii) Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions and
(iii) Commercial Healthcare Solutions markets; and

Ÿ

Government Communications Systems, serving (i) Civil, (ii) National Intelligence and (iii) Defense markets.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit our cyber integrated
solutions operation (“CIS”), which provided remote cloud hosting, and to dispose of the related assets, and we completed the sale of the remaining assets of CIS in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, our
Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our broadcast communications operation (“Broadcast Communications”), which provided digital media management solutions in support of broadcast customers, and we completed the sale of Broadcast
Communications in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Both CIS and Broadcast Communications were formerly part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see

Note 3: Discontinued
Operations

in



the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report (the “Notes”). Except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this Report
relate solely to our continuing operations.

At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, to leverage the breadth of
our information technology (“IT”) enterprise network and information assurance capabilities for the IT services market, we began managing our cyber security network testing operation as part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment
rather than our Government Communications Systems segment. As a result, we reassigned $2.4 million of goodwill (determined on a relative fair value basis) to our Integrated Network Solutions segment from our Government Communications Systems
segment. The historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this change to our business segment reporting structure for all periods presented in this
Report.

Financial information with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to our
business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or “Non-operating income (loss)” line items in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.

Financial Information About Our Business Segments

Financial information with respect to our business segments, including revenue, operating income or loss and total assets, and with respect to our operations outside the United States, is contained in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes and is incorporated herein by reference.

Description of Business by Segment

RF Communications

RF Communications is a global supplier of secure tactical radio communications and high-grade encryption solutions for military, government and commercial customers and also of secure communications
systems and equipment for public safety, utility and transportation customers. RF Communications serves (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications and (ii) Public Safety and Professional Communications
markets.

U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications
Market:

We design, develop and manufacture a comprehensive line of secure radio communications products and systems for manpack, handheld, vehicular, airborne, strategic fixed-site and shipboard installations that span the
communications architecture from High Capacity Line of Site, backbone radios to small soldier personal radios and tablet computers. The radios operate in various radio frequency bands, including high-frequency (“HF”), very high-frequency
(“VHF”), ultra high-frequency (“UHF”) and L-band, with higher frequencies supported for some of our network backbone products. Our radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission
requirements. Our Falcon

®

families of tactical radios are built on software-defined radio platforms that are
reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades. Our Falcon radios also have the highest grade embedded encryption and provide highly mobile, secure and reliable network communications capability without relying on a fixed infrastructure. This
capability allows warfighters, for example, to remain connected with each other and their command structures and support organizations. It also provides them the ability to communicate information and maintain situational awareness of both friendly
and opposing forces, which are critical to both the safety and success of their missions. Our radio systems have been widely deployed throughout all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and, in the international market,
have been sold to more than 100 countries through our international distribution channels consisting of regional sales offices and a broad dealer network and have become the standard in many of those countries.

Unlike many of our competitors operating on a government-funded programs-driven business model, we operate in this market on a
“commercial” customer-driven business model. This means that we anticipate market needs, invest our internal research and development resources, build to our internal forecast and provide ready-to-ship, commercial off-the-shelf
(“COTS”) products to customers, enabling us to bring products to market faster and adapt to changing customer requirements. We believe the U.S. market is transitioning from operational tempo to a modernization cycle driven by wideband
technology and that demand in the international market is being driven not only by the transition to wideband capability, but also by the need for network system solutions. Our extensive line of radios is designed to operate and interface well
together and support a variety of tactical requirements, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in the international market, where fully integrated solutions for command, control and communications are often required. We believe our
unique commercial business model that drives speed and innovation, coupled with the scale provided by our extensive international presence, will continue to make us competitive in the global market.

Our Falcon III

®

family of radios is the next generation of multiband, multi-mission tactical radios supporting U.S. and international network-centric operations worldwide. Our
Falcon III radios address the full range of current mission and interoperability requirements and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in our Falcon III radios
include the support of wideband networking



waveforms, extended frequency range and significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous generations. Our Falcon III radios are used in a wide variety of ground, vehicular and
airborne applications and include the following:

Ÿ

Our multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G (“117G”), which provides wideband networking capability, enabling enhanced situational awareness
through high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and connectivity to secure networks, and which is National Security Agency (“NSA”) Type-1-certified for narrowband
communications, as well as for wideband communications using our Harris-developed Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform (“ANW2”) for high bandwidth data operation and the U.S. military Joint Tactical Radio System (“JTRS”) Soldier
Radio Waveform (“SRW”);

Ÿ

Our 2-channel vehicular radio system, the AN/VRC-118 (“118”), which uses the DoD-developed Wideband Networking Waveform (“WNW”)
over L-band, and which we began shipping in fiscal 2014 under the U.S. Army JTRS Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio (“MNVR”) program;

Ÿ

Our multiband handheld radios, the AN/PRC-152 (“152”), which is the world’s most widely fielded JTRS-approved software-defined handheld
radio and offers a wide range of capabilities, and the AN/PRC-152A (“152A”), which builds on our 152 by adding wideband, networked communications capability and is the first radio of its kind to support both a full range of narrowband
legacy waveforms and wideband networking waveforms in a handheld platform; and

Ÿ

Our multi-channel manpack radio, the RF-340M (“340M”), which is the first and only commercially developed, NSA Type-1-certified radio
offering two channels integrated into the same chassis, and our wideband rifleman team radio, the RF-330E (“330E”), which is the commercially developed U.S. variant of our widely fielded international soldier personal radio.

In fiscal 2014, we continued to invest to position ourselves for tactical radio modernization opportunities,
for example, in developing our 340M and 330E and in incorporating the powerful Mobile User Objective System (“MUOS”) waveform into our products. Our 340M and 330E are our next-generation solutions for the U.S. Army JTRS Handheld, Manpack
and Small Form Factor tactical radio (“HMS”) program, for which the U.S. Army has officially changed its procurement strategy to full and open competition and a multi-vendor award, allowing us an opportunity to compete. We received the
first order for our 340M from a DoD customer in fiscal 2014, and our receipt of NSA certification was a significant milestone needed for deliveries to begin. MUOS is the DoD’s next-generation military satellite communications
(“SATCOM”) system that will deliver cellular-based service through tactical radios. We are embedding MUOS capability in our 340M, as well as offering it as a separate simple and fast software upgrade for widely fielded 117Gs, creating an
opportunity for the DoD to transition its 117G inventory to MUOS-capable radios and quickly maximize the use of the satellite infrastructure.

Examples of significant awards for us in fiscal 2014 included the following:

Ÿ

5-year multi-vendor, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts from the U.S. Army for SRW vehicular appliqué systems,
with a potential total value of $988 million;

Ÿ

A 2-year, $141 million sole-source, IDIQ contract from the U.S. Army for the MNVR program, with an initial order of $8 million for up to 232 radio
systems;

Ÿ

An $847 million increase in the ceiling value of our sole-source, IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command
(“CECOM”), which supports international sales of tactical radio systems under the U.S. Government’s Foreign Military Sales program; and

Ÿ

A number of significant international orders, many of which are a part of multi-year programs or larger opportunities, across a broad customer base,
including a $100 million follow-on order from Australia; orders of $82 million and $49 million from two countries in Asia, $78 million from a country in Central Asia and $14 million from the Philippines; orders of $49 million and $15 million from
two countries in the Middle East; orders of $36 million and $21 million from two NATO countries; and a $28 million order from a country in Latin America.

Public Safety and Professional Communications Market:

We supply assured communications

®

systems and equipment for public safety, Federal, utility, commercial and transportation organizations.

We design, build, distribute, maintain and supply wireless communications systems. Our Voice, Interoperability, Data
and Access (“VIDA”) network platform is a unified Internet Protocol (“IP’) based voice and data communications system that provides network-level interoperable communications among public safety agencies by supporting a full line
of communications systems, including OpenSky

®

, NetworkFirst, P25

IP

and Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
(“EDACS”). Our VIDA

®

network solutions currently serve as the backbone in some of the largest and most
advanced statewide and regional communications networks in North America. We also are investing in next-generation, secure public safety-grade Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) solutions for voice, video and data applications.



We also offer a full range of single-band land mobile radio terminals,
as well as our Unity

TM

family of multiband radios,
including a handheld radio and a full-spectrum mobile radio for vehicles. Our Unity multiband radios cover all public safety frequency bands in a single radio; operate on Association of Public Safety Communications Officials —
International (“APCO”) P25 conventional and trunked systems; are backwards compatible with analog FM systems; and include advanced capabilities, such as an internal Global Positioning System (“GPS”) receiver for situational
awareness, internal secure Bluetooth

®

wireless technology and background noise suppression features. They also
include true software-defined radio architecture that allows flexibility for future growth, including a software-only upgrade to APCO P25 Phase 2, the next-generation standard for mission-critical communications. Our Unity radios’ multiband,
multi-mode capabilities enable a single radio to communicate with multiple organizations, jurisdictions and agencies operating on different frequencies and systems, providing a significant improvement over many current radio systems for
U.S. public safety, which are not interoperable and thus require users to carry multiple radios or route transmissions through ad-hoc network bridges, often configured at the time of an emergency, and resulting in instances where agencies
responding to a common incident cannot talk to each other.

Other examples of our Public Safety and Professional Communications
solutions and services include the following:

Ÿ

We are designing and building the Alberta First Responders Radio Communications System that will provide public safety communications within the
256,000 square-mile Province of Alberta, Canada;

Ÿ

We are deploying a communications network for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority to increase operational efficiencies, improve safety
and provide interoperability with public safety agencies;

Ÿ

We are deploying an APCO P25 system for the U.S. Marine Corps Installations East region that also will provide interoperability with civilian agencies;
and

Ÿ

We are designing and deploying a VIDA network system for the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of National Security that will improve voice and data
communication and provide interoperability among first responders and the Ministry’s agencies.

and manage large, complex programs that integrate secure, advanced communications and information processing technologies in order to improve productivity and to achieve cost savings for our customers. Our networks and information systems for
large-scale, geographically dispersed enterprises offer advanced capabilities for collecting, processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying, distributing, storing and retrieving data. We are a leader in satellite ground data processing, in which
our systems consisting of complex suites of hardware and software receive sensor data from satellites and turn it into useable information.

As an example of our capabilities, we are the prime contractor and system architect under a 20-year contract awarded in July 2002, with a potential value of $5 billion, for the FAA Telecommunications
Infrastructure (“FTI”)



program to integrate, modernize, operate and maintain the communications infrastructure for the U.S. air traffic control system. We designed and deployed, and are currently operating and
maintaining, the FTI network, which is a fully operational, modern, secure and efficient network providing voice, data and video communications deployed at more than 4,500 FAA sites across the U.S.

We recently have been awarded multiple contracts for essential elements of the FAA’s multi-billion dollar Next Generation Air
Transportation System (“NextGen”) initiative to transform the U.S. air traffic control system to meet future requirements, including:

Ÿ

7-year contracts, with an aggregate contract value of $481 million, for the Data Communications Integrated Services (“Datacomm”) program
(including the Data Communications Network Service component) to transform voice-based air traffic control to automated air traffic management;

Ÿ

A 15-year, $291 million NextGen National Airspace System (“NAS”) Voice System (“NVS”) contract to create a modern Voice Over
Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) network for communications among air traffic controllers, pilots and ground personnel; and

Ÿ

A 5-year, $63 million NAS Enterprise Messaging Service (“NEMS”) IDIQ contract that provides the Systems Wide Information Management
(“SWIM”) program with enterprise-wide data sharing for a variety of critical information such as flight planning, traffic flow, surface radar and weather.

We also have developed a number of other solutions under FAA programs, including a voice switching and control system providing the
critical air-to-ground communications links between en-route aircraft and air traffic controllers throughout the continental U.S.; an integrated weather briefing and flight planning system for Alaska’s general aviation community; a
meteorological data processing system that generates radar mosaic data for air traffic controller displays and delivers weather data to critical subsystems within the NAS; and a satellite-based Alaskan NAS interfacility communications system linking
the Alaskan Air Route Traffic Control Center in Anchorage with FAA facilities throughout the region.

Another example of our
capabilities relates to the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — Series R

(“GOES-R”)

Ground and Antenna Segment weather programs. Under two 10-year contracts, with
an aggregate potential value of approximately $1 billion (including change orders), we are providing a complete, end-to-end solution to design, develop, deploy and operate the ground segment system that will receive and process satellite data
and generate and distribute weather data to more than 10,000 direct users, as well as providing the command and control of operational satellites. We also are supplying antennas and control systems that will provide communications links for command,
telemetry and sensor data, as well as the communications link to direct data users. The new antennas will operate with next-generation GOES-R satellites and will be compatible with existing GOES-N through GOES-P satellites. In fiscal 2013, the
GOES-R weather program transitioned from the design and development phase to the integration, test and deployment phase.

We
also are modernizing the ground segment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (“TDRSS”) network under a 5-year contract, potentially worth $140 million, for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (“SGSS”)
program for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”). The TDRSS network is used by satellites and spacecraft in low-Earth orbit to relay data continuously to ground stations in White Sands, New Mexico and in Guam. The
modernization will improve situational awareness for TDRSS network operators, upgrade computing and signal processing equipment, enhance reliability and maintainability, improve efficiency and reduce operations and sustainment costs.

National Intelligence Market:

A significant portion of this market involves classified programs. Although
classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report, the operating results relating to classified programs are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the business risks associated with those programs do not
differ materially from the business risks of other U.S. Government programs.

We are a major developer, supplier and
integrator of communications and information processing products, systems and networks for a diverse base of U.S. Intelligence Community programs, and we support the ongoing transformation of the Intelligence Community into a more collaborative
enterprise. Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency customers, including NSA, the National Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (“NGA”), we provide integrated ISR
solutions that improve situational awareness, data collection accuracy and product analysis by correlating near real-time mission data and intelligence reference data for display and analysis by strategic and tactical planners and decision makers.
Our ISR systems help to integrate information across the analyst workflow, accelerating the movement of information that has been collected and processed.

For example, our image processing capabilities extend from algorithm development through delivery of operations systems, and we are providing advanced image exploitation and dissemination solutions for
ISR applications by advancing image processing, image data fusion, display technologies and digital product generation



techniques. Applicable technologies range from new techniques for merging and displaying imagery to automated techniques for image screening, cueing and remote visualization. Also, our mapping
and visualization capabilities provide complete, accurate and timely knowledge about the threat, the terrain, the status and the location of single or multiple opposing and friendly forces and their support by utilizing data, pictures, voice and
video drawn from vast storage banks or from real-time input which can be transmitted around the world in fractions of a second. In addition, we have industry-leading capabilities in the architecture, design and development of highly specialized
satellite antennas, structures, phased arrays and on-board processors, which are used to enable next-generation satellite systems to provide the U.S. military and intelligence communities with strategic and tactical advantages. We are also a
leader in the design and development of antenna and reflector technologies for commercial space telecommunications applications. With more than 50 reflectors in orbit, we are the leading supplier of large reflector apertures and deployable mesh
antenna systems for government and commercial applications.

In fiscal 2014, we were awarded a number of new contracts and
follow-on contracts under classified programs. In addition, we were awarded two 5-year, single-award IDIQ contracts, with an aggregate contract value of $773 million, by the NGA for the Foundation GEOINT Content Management (“FGCM”) program
to provide imagery products for two of three regions

-

$365 million for Region A for the U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Northern Command and $408 million for Region C for the U.S. Africa Command and U.S.
Southern Command (the Region C award, however, is currently under protest).

We also are leveraging our core capabilities to
address adjacencies and create new opportunities. For example, we are supplying Aireon, LLC with 81 automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (“ADS-B”) receiver payloads that will be part of a

satellite-based

aircraft tracking system to enhance global air traffic control. The payloads will be hosted on the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation but provide a capability separate from the main mission
of the constellation, and we are adding other customers and increasing the number of payloads. In fiscal 2014, we received a $63 million order for a new payload program on the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation, and in the first quarter of fiscal
2015, we were awarded a $495 million multi-vendor IDIQ contract from the U.S. Air Force for the Hosted Payload Solutions (“HoPS”) program for commercial hosting capabilities for U.S. Government payloads, which provides us a contract
vehicle to pursue additional opportunities.

Defense Market:

We develop, supply and integrate
communications and information processing products, systems and networks for a diverse base of aerospace, terrestrial and maritime applications supporting DoD missions, and we are committed to delivering leading-edge technologies that support the
ongoing transformations of military communications for U.S. and international customers. Our technologies are providing advanced mobile wideband networking capabilities to assure timely and secure network-centric capabilities across strategic,
operational and tactical boundaries in support of the DoD’s full spectrum of warfighting, intelligence and logistics missions. Our major technology capabilities include advanced ground control systems and SATCOM terminals for transportable
ground, fixed-site and shipboard applications; flat-panel, phased-array and single-mission antennas; advanced aviation electronics for military jets, including digital maps, processors, sensors, data buses, fiber optics and microelectronics; and
high-speed data links and data networks for wireless communications. We also develop and supply state-of-the-art wireless voice and data products and solutions.

Examples of ongoing programs for us in this market include the following:

Ÿ

The U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (“MET”) program, for which we are developing, under a ten-year contract awarded in
fiscal 2009 with a potential value of $600 million, next-generation large satellite earth stations to provide the worldwide backbone for high-priority military communications and missile defense systems and to support IP and Dedicated Circuit
Connectivity within the Global Information Grid, providing critical reach-back capability for the warfighter (and which has started full-rate production); and

Ÿ

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“F-35”) and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet (“F/A-18E/F”) aircraft platform programs, for which we provide
high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image processing, digital map software and other electronic components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link communications
subsystems primarily intended for stealth platform air-to-air communications and which allow

F-35s

to communicate in a stealth fashion with other network nodes without revealing their positions.

In fiscal 2014, we were awarded an 8-year, single-award IDIQ follow-on contract for $133 million for the
U.S. Navy’s Commercial Broadband Satellite program, bringing total potential program value to more than $250 million; and a 5-year multi-vendor Communication Transmission Systems IDIQ contract from the U.S. Army to provide upgrades and
maintenance of its terrestrial communications networks worldwide.



Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue for our
Government Communications Systems segment increased 1.0 percent to $1,801 million in fiscal 2014 compared with $1,784 million in fiscal 2013, and was $1,786 million in fiscal 2012. Segment operating income increased 9.9 percent
to $276.9 million in fiscal 2014 compared with $252.0 million in fiscal 2013, and was $253.3 million in fiscal 2012. The percentage of our revenue contributed by this segment was 36 percent in fiscal 2014 compared with
35 percent in fiscal 2013 and 33 percent in fiscal 2012. The percentages of this segment’s revenue under contracts directly with end customers and under contracts with prime contractors were approximately 74 percent and
26 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2014 compared with approximately 73 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2013 and 69 percent and 31 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014, this segment had a
diverse portfolio of over 200 programs. Some of this segment’s more significant programs in fiscal 2014 included FTI, GOES-R, F-35, MET, wireless products, SGSS, Datacomm, hosted payloads and various classified programs. The percentages of this
segment’s revenue in a particular fiscal year represented by this segment’s largest program by revenue in such fiscal year and ten largest programs by revenue in such fiscal year were approximately 14 percent and 53 percent,
respectively, in fiscal 2014 compared with approximately 13 percent and 49 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2013 and 13 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2012. The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived
from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 93 percent
in fiscal 2014 compared with approximately 93 percent in fiscal 2013 and 97 percent in fiscal 2012. For a general description of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated thereunder and of
cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price contracts, see “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers; Government Contracts” of this Report.

The funded backlog for this segment was $918 million at the end of fiscal 2014 compared with $948 million at the end of fiscal 2013 and $842 million at the end of fiscal 2012. Unfunded backlog
for this segment was $3,263 million at the end of fiscal 2014 compared with $2,492 million at the end of fiscal 2013 and $2,695 million at the end of fiscal 2012. Additional information regarding funded and unfunded backlog is provided under
“Item 1. Business — Funded and Unfunded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see
“Item 1. Business — Principal Customers; Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

International Business

Revenue from products and services exported from
the U.S. (including foreign military sales) or manufactured or rendered abroad was $1,482 million (30 percent of our revenue) in fiscal 2014 compared with $1,313 million (26 percent of our revenue) in fiscal 2013 and $1,330 million
(24 percent of our revenue) in fiscal 2012. Essentially all of our international sales are derived from our RF Communications and Integrated Network Solutions segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas
sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Financial information regarding our domestic and international operations is contained in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes and is
incorporated herein by reference.

The majority of our international marketing activities are conducted through subsidiaries
which operate in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America, Africa and Asia. We have also established international marketing organizations and several regional sales offices. For further information regarding our international
subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 of this Report.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers, distributors and
sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and internationally. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or governmental
customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a
discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. The percentages of our total revenue and of our international revenue represented by revenue from indirect sales channels were
approximately 13 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2014 compared with approximately 10 percent and 33 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2013 and 12 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2012.

Fiscal 2014 international revenue came from a large number of countries, and no such single country accounted for more than 3 percent of
our total revenue. Some of our exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment
often cover most of the related costs incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in international markets, we also sometimes enter into offset agreements or
recourse or vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain customers.



The particular economic, social and political conditions for business conducted outside the
U.S. differ from those encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that the overall business risk for our international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic businesses as a whole. A description
of the types of risks to which we are subject in our international business is contained in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are partially mitigated by the
diversification of our international business and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Many of our competitors in each of
our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that our management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions;
ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.

In the RF Communications segment, principal competitors include Airbus DS Communications (formerly Cassidian Communications, an Airbus Group company), Aselsan A.S., Bharat Electronics Limited, Elbit
Systems Ltd., Exelis Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, JVC Kenwood Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Rockwell Collins, Inc., the Rohde & Schwarz Group, Selex ES (a Finmeccanica Group company), Tait Ltd. and Thales Group.

In the Integrated Network Solutions segment, principal competitors include Astrium Services Government, Inc. (an Airbus Group company),
Computer Sciences Corporation, Engility Holdings, Inc., Exelis Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Leidos Holdings, Inc., Lockheed Martin Corporation, MTN, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and RigNet, Inc.

In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal competitors include BAE Systems plc, The Boeing Company, Exelis Inc., General
Dynamics Corporation,

L-3

Communications Holdings, Inc., Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, and Rockwell Collins, Inc. We frequently “partner” or are
involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs.

Principal
Customers; Government Contracts

The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government
customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 67 percent in fiscal 2014 compared with
approximately 67 percent in fiscal 2013 and 70 percent in fiscal 2012. No other customer accounted for more than 4 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2014. Additional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided
under “Item 1. Business — Description of Business by Segment” of this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Most
of the sales in our Government Communications Systems segment and with respect to U.S. Government programs in our Integrated Network Solutions segment are made directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
containing standard government contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default based on performance.

Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Government-wide Acquisition
Contracts (“GWACs”) and multi-vendor IDIQ contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under such contracts.

Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus payment of a fee and
fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fee that may
increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results compared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of
an award fee determined at the customer’s discretion based on our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a
portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, charitable contributions
and certain litigation defense costs.



Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or
fixed-price incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our U.S.
Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of target cost up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher
than the target cost), but carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met.
Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually receive either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government in amounts
equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract. Our production contracts are
mainly fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.

As stated above,
U.S. Government contracts are terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government are dependent on Congressional
appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from various military, political, economic and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government contracts and related
orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable
costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to
pay for the incremental cost of re-procurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and
schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency
requirements. For further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Funded and Unfunded Backlog

Our total Company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was approximately $7,202 million at the end of fiscal 2014 compared with approximately $6,789 million at the end of fiscal 2013 and $6,993 million
at the end of fiscal 2012. The funded portion of this backlog was approximately $3,018 million at the end of fiscal 2014 compared with approximately $3,179 million at the end of fiscal 2013 and $3,056 million at the end of fiscal 2012. The
determination of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and development and production contracts of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the case of
U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. We define unfunded backlog as primarily unfilled firm contract value for which funding has not yet been authorized or, in the case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated, including the value of
contract options in cases of material contracts that have options we believe are probable of being exercised, as well as the most probable value of material sole-source IDIQ contracts awarded for a specific limited purpose. In fiscal 2015, we expect
to fill approximately 59 percent of our total funded backlog as of June 27, 2014. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject
to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control. Additional information with regard to the backlog of each of our segments is provided under “Item 1. Business — Description of Business by Segment”
of this Report.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures totaled approximately $865 million in fiscal 2014, $900 million in fiscal 2013 and $838 million in fiscal 2012. Company-sponsored research and development costs,
which included research and development for commercial products and services and independent research and development related to government products and services, as well as concept formulation studies and technology development that occurs on bid
and proposal efforts, were approximately $264 million in fiscal 2014, $254 million in fiscal 2013 (including an approximately $18 million write-off of capitalized software in our Integrated Network Solutions segment) and $219 million in fiscal
2012. A portion of our independent research and development costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored research and development costs not otherwise allocable are
charged to expense when incurred. The portion of total research and



development expenditures that was not Company-sponsored — principally funded by the U.S. Government and included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services — was $601
million in fiscal 2014, $646 million in fiscal 2013 and $619 million in fiscal 2012. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development of new products and services and to building technological capability in selected communications and
electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. As of June 27, 2014, we employed approximately 6,000 engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts to make the
technologies developed in any of our business segments available for all other business segments.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a
large and valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license intellectual
property to and from third parties. As of June 27, 2014, we held approximately 1,100 U.S. patents and 1,070 foreign patents, and had approximately 340 U.S. patent applications pending (and 640 foreign patent applications
pending). Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business and the operations of our business
segments, we do not consider our business or any business segment to be materially dependent on any single patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are
engaged in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements have generated income in past years and may do so in
the future, there can be no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our patents, trade secrets,
trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” of this Report. With regard to certain patents relating to our Government Communications Systems and RF Communications segments, the U.S. Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the
U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous
trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect
the environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions. The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve. We believe that we have complied with these requirements
and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Based on currently available information, we do not expect expenditures over the next several years to protect the
environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords, to have a material impact on our competitive position or
financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations. If future treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher
than our present estimates of those expenditures. We have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and prevention goals. We did not spend material
amounts on environmental capital projects in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates to historic discontinued operations (other than CIS and Broadcast Communications) for which we have retained
certain environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be material in fiscal 2015. These amounts may increase in future years. Additional information regarding
environmental and regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report and in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions, such as domestic and international
requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers, including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Directive 2002/95/EC on the
Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not applicable to most equipment
produced by our Government Communications Systems and RF Communications segments. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend to
comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products.



Wireless communications (whether radio, satellite or telecommunications) are also subject to
governmental regulation. Equipment produced in our RF Communications and Integrated Network Solutions segments, in particular, is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio and television
frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. Additionally, we hold licenses for our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions market for very small aperture terminals and satellite earth stations, which
authorize operation of networks and teleports. We are also required to comply with technical operating and licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations
and licenses with respect to our existing products and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous
sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent on suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of
components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent
on one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Although we have been affected by financial and performance
issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of natural
disasters, or the RoHS environmental regulations in the European Union or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. These events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain electronic components (such as lead-free components), resulting
in industry-wide supply chain shortages. To date, these component shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our business. For further discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
of this Report.

Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and
the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

We had
approximately 14,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2014. Approximately 91 percent of our employees as of the end of fiscal 2014 were located in the U.S. A significant number of our employees possess a U.S. Government security clearance.
We also utilize a number of independent contractors. None of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union. In certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In
general, we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

We have
described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report. In
addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which
could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.

We depend on U.S. Government
customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers. The
percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through
prime contractors, was approximately 67 percent in fiscal 2014, 67 percent in fiscal 2013 and 70 percent in fiscal 2012. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government would
significantly reduce our revenue. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other
contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek will be awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to multiple competitive bidding
processes, including multi-vendor IDIQ, GWAC, General Services Administration Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly competitive markets and our
competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under
multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, as well as the risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the
resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging
contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. Our U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels
of funding during the budget and appropriation process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels
remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts) and whether it will be superseded by alternate arrangements. A change in
U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our future business. For more
information regarding sequestration, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Considerations — Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks” of
this Report.

We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual
contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally
appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are obligated
only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our
operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.



Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by
U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We
have recorded contract revenues based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and
final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of
time.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part,
without prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our U.S. Government contracts will not be
terminated under these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant
portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio-economic and
other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from
U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations,
employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse
impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.

We
could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.

We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the Internet, malware,
computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems. We face an added risk of a security breach
or other significant disruption of the IT networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other
sensitive government functions or personally identifiable or protected health information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and
cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. As a communications and IT company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a
heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that
we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are
critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage
the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected
information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are
constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks.
Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant
disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:

Ÿ

Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;



Ÿ

Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise
valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;

Ÿ

Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;

Ÿ

Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;

Ÿ

Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and

Ÿ

Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the public generally.

Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in
inflation.

We have a number of fixed-price contracts, which allow us to benefit from cost savings, but subject us to
the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts because we assume all of the cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose us to
potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any
cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw
materials, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. The U.S. and other countries also may experience a significant increase in inflation. A
significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable
terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet
the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
The potential impact of such risk on our financial results would increase if the mix of our contracts and programs shifted toward a greater percentage of fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price contracts.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally,
including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. The
percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products and services exported from the U.S. (including foreign military sales) or manufactured or rendered abroad was 30 percent in fiscal 2014, 26 percent in fiscal 2013 and
24 percent in fiscal 2012. Approximately 28 percent of our international business in fiscal 2014 was transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that
international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in, less-developed
countries. We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:

Ÿ

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;

Ÿ

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of
U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

Ÿ

Changes in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other
trade restrictions;

Ÿ

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;

Ÿ

The complexity and necessity of using, and disruptions involving our, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

Ÿ

The difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and
practices;

Ÿ

Difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;

Ÿ

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

Ÿ

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract
clauses; and



Ÿ

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or
U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct
of our employees, agents or business partners.

We have implemented compliance controls, policies and procedures
designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials (such as
the FCPA), and to detect any such reckless or criminal acts committed. We cannot ensure, however, that our controls, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts. If not prevented, such reckless or criminal acts
could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our reputation.

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales
to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various
U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the U.S. For example, the U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location
of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful
in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The continued effects of the general weakness in the global economy and the
U.S. Government’s budget deficits and national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The economies of the U.S. and many foreign countries in which we do business continue to show weakness or limited improvement. We are
unable to predict the impact, severity and duration of these economic events. The continued effects of these economic events and the U.S. Government’s budget deficits and national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways. Possible effects of these economic conditions include the following:

Ÿ

The U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we
participate;

Ÿ

The U.S. Government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and thus would be required
either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a “continuing resolution” that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or
delayed orders or payments for products and services we provide. If the U.S. Government budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, it may decrease our revenue, profitability or cash flows or otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;

Ÿ

U.S. Government spending could be impacted by sequestration or alternate arrangements, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in
predicting, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels;

Ÿ

We may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by the
economic problems of our customers and prospective customers (including U.S. Federal, state and local governments);

Ÿ

We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and
subcontractors; and

Ÿ

We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt
markets, or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities.

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
current and future markets.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized by rapidly changing
technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

Ÿ

Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;



Ÿ

Develop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;

Ÿ

Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies
from those of our competitors; and

Ÿ

Develop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products, systems, services and
technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the
timely development of new products, systems, services or technologies. Due to the design complexity of some of our products, systems, services and technologies, we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products,
systems, services or technologies in the future. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or
technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our
competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or
technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The future direction of the domestic and global economies, including its
impact on customer demand, also will have a significant impact on our overall performance.

We participate in markets that are often
subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. In particular, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to
predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and whether it will be superseded by alternate arrangements. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in which we participate. Because all
components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may
make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.

We cannot predict the consequences of future
geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the Middle East and Asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political
events throughout the world have created economic and political uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. These matters cause uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance
markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. These matters also may cause our insurance coverages and performance bonds to increase in cost, or in some cases, to
be unavailable altogether.

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that involve significant
risks and uncertainties.

Strategic acquisitions and divestitures that we have made in the past, and may continue to
make, present significant risks and uncertainties, which include:

Ÿ

Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation
issues, potential liabilities or other acquisition risks;

Ÿ

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets
in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;

Ÿ

Difficulty in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating
software code;

Ÿ

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;

Ÿ

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be
successful in those markets;

Ÿ

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any
indemnifying parties;

Ÿ

Potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses acquired or to be divested;



Ÿ

Risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions or within expected timeframes; and

Ÿ

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts
or services, could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

We engage subcontractors on many of our contracts. We may have disputes with our subcontractors, including regarding the quality and
timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a subcontractor or vice versa or the
subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain parts, components and services for many of our products and services which we source from other manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from time to
time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that we require. Our supply chain could also be disrupted by external events, such as natural
disasters or other significant disruptions (including extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks and labor disputes), governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (including product certification or
stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity and climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards). Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially impair our
ability to manufacture and deliver products and services to our customers. We can give no assurances that we will be free from disputes with our subcontractors, material supply problems or component, subsystems or services problems in the future.
Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, which might result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty claims
and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Third parties have claimed in the past and may
claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which often has
resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to
have infringed directly or indirectly upon those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or
license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, services and solutions. Our success depends in large part on our
proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully
protect and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer. Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In
addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive
position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

From time to time, we are defendants
in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these
or new matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. A significant portion of our
business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense, technology and communications systems and products. New technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. Components of certain of the
defense systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential to cause loss of life and extensive property
damage. In most circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the



U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for us to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity
and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the
public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:

Ÿ

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;

Ÿ

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

Ÿ

Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of
goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with acquisitions;

Ÿ

Changes in available tax credits;

Ÿ

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

Ÿ

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;

Ÿ

Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and

Ÿ

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other
significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our Government Communications Systems
segment are located in Florida and significant operations of our Integrated Network Solutions segment are located in Houston, Texas, which areas are subject to the risk of major hurricanes. Our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers
could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages
and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the
operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in the regulatory framework under which our managed satellite and terrestrial
communications solutions operations are operated could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our domestic satellite and terrestrial communications solutions are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are therefore subject to a lesser degree of regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission and other Federal, state and local agencies than if provided on a common carrier basis. Our international satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations are regulated by governments of various countries other than the U.S.
and by other international authorities. The regulatory regimes applicable to our international satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations frequently require that we obtain and maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our
operations in accordance with prescribed standards. Compliance with such requirements may inhibit our ability to quickly expand our operations into new countries, including in circumstances in which such expansion is required in order to provide
uninterrupted service to existing customers with mobile operations as they move to new locations on short notice. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various penalties or sanctions. The adoption of new laws or
regulations, changes to the existing domestic or international regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our
managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions, and any bandwidth constraints could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations, we compete for satellite bandwidth with other commercial
entities, such as other satellite communications services providers and broadcasting companies, and with governmental entities, such as the military. In certain markets and at certain times, satellite bandwidth may be



limited and/or pricing of satellite bandwidth could be subject to competitive pressure. In such cases, we may be unable to secure sufficient bandwidth needed to provide our managed satellite
communications services, either at favorable rates or at all. This inability could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and
write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time
to time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounted for approximately 35 percent of our recorded total assets as of June 27, 2014. We evaluate the recoverability of
recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reportable segments and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in
expected reportable segment cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. For additional information on accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under
“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report and

We must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so could
seriously harm us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract and retain significant numbers of skilled personnel,
including personnel holding security clearances, to support our growth and to replace individuals whose employment has terminated due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has
been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such
employees were unmet.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our
principal executive offices are located at owned facilities in Melbourne, Florida. As of June 27, 2014, we operated approximately 150 locations in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America, Africa and Asia, consisting
of about 6.9 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative, research and development, warehousing, engineering and office space, of which we owned approximately 4.5 million square feet and leased approximately 2.4 million
square feet. There are no material encumbrances on any of our owned facilities. Our leased facilities are, for the most part, occupied under leases for remaining terms ranging from one month to 11 years, a majority of which can be terminated or
renewed at no longer than 5-year intervals at our option. As of June 27, 2014, we had major operations at the following locations:

RF Communications

— Rochester, New York; Lynchburg, Virginia; Chelmsford, Massachusetts; Queensland, Australia; and Columbia, Maryland.

Integrated Network Solutions

— Houston, Texas; Herndon and Alexandria, Virginia; Macae, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;
Melbourne, Florida; Aberdeen, United Kingdom; Forrestfield, Australia; Singapore; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Calgary, Canada; and Bellevue, Nebraska.

Government Communications Systems

— Palm Bay, Melbourne and Malabar, Florida; Chantilly, Virginia; Annapolis Junction and Seabrook, Maryland; and Washington, D.C.

Corporate

— Melbourne, Florida.



The following is a summary of the approximate floor space of our offices and facilities in
productive use, by segment, at June 27, 2014:

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or leased, are suitable and adequate for their
intended purposes and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs. Although we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are not considered significant. We frequently review our anticipated requirements for facilities and
will, from time to time, acquire additional facilities, expand existing facilities and dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof, as management deems necessary. For more information about our lease obligations, see

Note 18: Lease
Commitments

in the Notes. Our facilities and other properties are generally maintained in good operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of business in which we are, and
were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and litigation or arbitration is commenced by or against us arising from or related to matters, including but not limited to: product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks, trade
secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; strategic acquisitions or divestitures; the prior sale or use of former products allegedly containing asbestos or other restricted materials;
breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed amounts against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We record accruals for
losses related to those matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and legal costs generally are expensed when incurred. Although it is
not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, it is reasonably possible that some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us and in excess of the amounts currently accrued. Based on
available information, in the opinion of management, settlements, arbitration awards and final judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at June 27, 2014 are reserved
against or would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Tax
Audits.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities
or ultimately through established legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits; however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the amounts recorded in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. See

Note 21: Income Taxes

in the Notes for additional information regarding audits and examinations by taxing authorities of our tax filings.

U.S. Government Business.

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are engaged in supplying goods and
services to the U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government
contracts typically involve long lead times for design and development, are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
design and production of complex and technologically advanced products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government as either a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes may
arise between the prime contractor and the U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its subcontractors and may result in litigation or arbitration between the contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(“FAR”), which outline uniform policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the U.S. Government, and specific agency acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement. As a U.S. Government contractor, our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continuing basis by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”). The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a U.S. Government
contractor’s compliance with, the contractor’s internal control systems and



policies, including the contractor’s accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. In addition to these routine audits, from time to time, we
may, either individually or in conjunction with other U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits and investigations by other agencies of the U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our
performance and administration of our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable contractual requirements and procurement and other applicable Federal laws and regulations. These investigations may be conducted without our
knowledge. We are unable to predict the outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted against us or our officers or employees. Under present U.S. Government procurement
laws and regulations, if indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement or other Federal laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory
or treble damages. U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from eligibility for awards of new U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension or
debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition, our export privileges could be suspended or revoked, which also would have a material adverse effect on us. For further
discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

International.

As an international company, we are, from time to time, the subject of investigations
relating to our international operations, including under U.S. export control laws and the FCPA and other similar U.S. and international laws. As discussed below in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report, on April 4, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Carefx Corporation (“Carefx”) and thereby also acquired its subsidiaries, including in China (“Carefx China”).
Following the closing, we became aware that certain entertainment, travel and other expenses in connection with the Carefx China operations may have been incurred or recorded improperly. In response, we initiated an internal investigation and
learned that certain employees of the Carefx China operations had provided pre-paid gift cards and other gifts and payments to certain customers, potential customers, consultants and government regulators, after which we took certain remedial
actions. The results of the investigation have been disclosed to our Audit Committee, Board of Directors and auditors, and voluntarily to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC. The SEC and DOJ have initiated investigations
with respect to this matter and we are fully cooperating with such investigations. We cannot predict at this time the duration or scope of, developments in, results of, or any regulatory action or other potential consequences from, such
investigations or otherwise in connection with this matter. However, based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous U.S. Federal, state and international
environmental laws and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time in investigations or litigation of various potential environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or former facilities or remediation as a result of
past activities (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From time to time, we receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or international environmental agencies that we are a potentially
responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup costs at various sites,
which include sites owned by us, sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us from past operations. We own, previously owned or are currently named as a
potentially responsible party at 14 such sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these proceedings,
in the opinion of our management, any payments we may be required to make as a result of such claims in existence at June 27, 2014 will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Additional information regarding environmental matters is set forth in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes under the caption “Environmental Expenditures”, which information is incorporated herein by reference,
and in “Item 1. Business — Environmental and Other Regulations” of this Report.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.

Not Applicable.



EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

The name, age, position held with us, and principal occupation and employment during at least the past 5 years for each of our
executive officers as of August 22, 2014, were as follows:



There is no family relationship between any of our executive officers or directors. There are no
arrangements or understandings between any of our executive officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any of them was appointed or elected as an officer or director, other than arrangements or understandings with our directors or
officers acting solely in their capacities as such. All of our executive officers are elected annually and serve at the pleasure of our Board of Directors.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Market Information and Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and traded on the NYSE, under the ticker symbol “HRS.” According to the records of our transfer agent, as of August 22, 2014, there
were approximately 4,969 holders of record of our common stock. The high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the NYSE consolidated transactions reporting system and the dividends paid on our common stock for each quarterly period
in our last two fiscal years are reported below:

On August 22,
2014, the last sale price of our common stock as reported in the NYSE consolidated transactions reporting system was $71.02 per share.

Dividends

The cash
dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in our last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On August 23, 2014, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.42 per share to
$.47 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $1.88 per share, which was our thirteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash dividend rate was $1.68 per share in fiscal 2014. Our annualized
cash dividend rate was $1.48 per share in fiscal 2013. Our annualized cash dividend rate was $1.32 per share for the last two quarters of fiscal 2012 and $1.12 per share for the first two quarters of fiscal 2012. Quarterly cash dividends are
typically paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends. The declaration of dividends and the
amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Harris Stock Performance Graph

The following performance graph and table do not constitute soliciting material and the performance graph and table should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other previous or
future filings by us under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate the performance graph and table by reference therein.

The performance graph and table below compare the 5-year cumulative total return of our common stock with the comparable 5-year cumulative
total returns of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Aerospace & Defense Index (“S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense”). The
figures in the performance graph and table below assume an initial investment of $100 at the close of business on July 3, 2009 in Harris, the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense and the reinvestment of all dividends.

HARRIS, S&P 500 AND S&P 500 AEROSPACE & DEFENSE

Sales of Unregistered Securities

During fiscal 2014, we did not issue or sell any unregistered securities.

Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 4,560,802 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs at
an average price per share of $65.76, excluding commissions. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 8,287,130 shares of our common stock under our repurchase program at an average price per share of $48.25, excluding commissions. The level of our
repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, volume and
nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.



The following table sets forth information with respect to repurchases by us of our common
stock during the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2014:

*

Periods represent our fiscal months.

(1)

On August 26, 2013, we announced that on August 23, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (our “2013 Repurchase
Program”) authorizing us to repurchase up to $1 billion in shares of our common stock through open-market transactions, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. Our
2013 Repurchase Program was in addition to our prior share repurchase program approved in 2011 (our “2011 Repurchase Program”). Our repurchases during the quarter ended December 27, 2013 used the remaining authorization under our 2011
Repurchase Program. As of June 27, 2014, $833,501,670 (as reflected in the table above) was the approximate dollar amount of our common stock that may yet be purchased under our 2013 Repurchase Program, which does not have a stated expiration
date. Our repurchase programs have resulted, and our 2013 Repurchase Program is expected to continue to result, in repurchases in excess of the dilutive effect of shares issued under our share-based incentive plans. However, the level of our
repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, volume and
nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

(2)

Represents a combination of (a) shares of our common stock delivered to us in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligation by holders of
employee stock options who exercised stock options, (b) shares of our common stock delivered to us in satisfaction of the tax withholding obligation of holders of performance shares, performance share units or restricted shares that vested
during the quarter, (c) performance shares, performance share units, restricted shares or restricted stock units returned to us upon retirement or employment termination of employees or (d) shares of our common stock purchased by, or sold
to us by, the Harris Corporation Master Rabbi Trust, with the trustee thereof acting at our direction, to fund obligations of the Rabbi Trust under our deferred compensation plans. Our equity incentive plans provide that the value of shares
delivered to us to pay the exercise price of options or to cover tax withholding obligations shall be the closing price of our common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs.

The information required by this Item with respect to securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans is included
in “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters — Equity Compensation Plan Information” of this Report. See

Note 14: Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation

in the Notes for a general description of our share-based incentive plans.

— cautionary information about forward-looking statements
and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections.

BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information technology company serving government and
commercial markets in more than 125 countries. We are dedicated to developing best-in-class

assured communications

®

products, systems and services for global
markets. Our company generates revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing and selling communications products and software as well as providing related services. We sell directly to our customers, the largest of which are
U.S. Government customers and their prime contractors, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the products and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the financial
results of our continuing operations in the following three business segments:

Ÿ

RF Communications, serving (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications (“Tactical Communications”) and
(ii) Public Safety and Professional Communications markets;

Ÿ

Integrated Network Solutions, serving (i) IT Services, (ii) Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions (which market is
served by our Harris CapRock Communications business) and (iii) Commercial Healthcare Solutions markets; and

Ÿ

Government Communications Systems, serving (i) Civil, (ii) National Intelligence and (iii) Defense markets.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit CIS, which provided
remote cloud hosting, and to dispose of the related assets, and we completed the sale of the remaining assets of CIS in the first



quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest Broadcast Communications, which provided digital media management solutions in
support of broadcast customers, and we completed the sale of Broadcast Communications in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Both CIS and Broadcast Communications were formerly part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment. For additional
information regarding discontinued operations, see

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

in the Notes. Except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this Report relate solely to our continuing
operations.

At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, to leverage the breadth of our IT enterprise network and
information assurance capabilities for the IT services market, we began managing our cyber security network testing operation as part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment rather than our Government Communications Systems segment. As a result,
we reassigned $2.4 million of goodwill (determined on a relative fair value basis) to our Integrated Network Solutions segment from our Government Communications Systems segment. The historical results, discussion and presentation of our business
segments as set forth in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this change to our business segment reporting structure for all periods presented in this Report.

Financial information with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments or
discontinued operations, is reported as part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or “Non-operating income (loss)” line items in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.

Value Drivers of Our Business

Our two core value drivers are excellence and innovation.

Our Company-wide
commitment to excellence is embodied in our Harris Business Excellence (“HBX”) program, which provides the framework and tools that empower every employee to drive continuous improvement in business performance and customer satisfaction.
HBX incorporates standardized, industry-proven processes and tools based on the principles of Lean and Six Sigma. Fiscal 2014 was the first full year of program implementation, and we made significant strides in three primary areas — customer
satisfaction, productivity and asset velocity — through our efforts to optimize processes, eliminate waste, reduce costs and enhance quality across our Company, including in areas such as manufacturing and field operations, supply chain and
overhead functions, and working capital initiatives. One method we use to drive continuous improvement is “value engineering” — continuously evaluating new materials, processes and technologies to insert into products already in
production, helping to reduce costs and improve both quality and customer satisfaction.

Innovation is at the very core of our
success, and investment in research and development (“R&D”) represents its foundation. Our R&D investments are focused on adding new features to existing products, tailoring offerings for international markets, and creating totally
new-to-the-world solutions to address our customers’ toughest communications challenges. Innovation also leads to natural extensions of our core capabilities for capturing new opportunities in adjacent markets. Innovation provides
differentiation and a key competitive advantage for us.

To ensure our investment in R&D is cost-effective and supports
innovation across the entire Company, we have adopted a portfolio management approach, optimizing investment at the Company level rather than the business unit level. We have introduced standardized processes and common metrics to track progress and
gauge success, and we have established Core Technology Centers to more fully leverage R&D investment across our Company.

Innovation at Harris also includes introducing new business models to the marketplace to provide our customers with innovative solutions
at lower costs. For example, in the tactical communications market, we provide a “commercial off-the-shelf” approach that entails investing our own R&D funds to provide new mission-critical communications at a much faster pace and
lower cost compared to the lengthy development cycle of the traditional program-of-record approach. We also partnered with the FAA to provide a fully-managed service for the FAA FTI network that provides mission-critical network capabilities to
connect controllers and pilots across more than 4,000 nodes, resulting in significantly higher bandwidth and uptime at half the cost of the traditional approach. We also are at the forefront of a unique piggyback approach of using
commercially-hosted satellite payloads to provide multiple missions on satellites, speeding time-to-mission and lowering costs compared to the traditional model of building and launching separate exquisite satellites for each mission requirement.

Key Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common
share; revenue; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital; and return on average equity. The measure of our success is reflected in our
results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.



Fiscal 2014 Results of Operations Key
Indicators:

Income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common share, revenue, and income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our
value drivers:

Ÿ

Income from continuing operations increased 15.7 percent to $539.8 million in fiscal 2014 from $466.4 million in fiscal 2013;

Ÿ

Income from continuing operations per diluted common share increased 20.2 percent to $5.00 in fiscal 2014 from $4.16 in fiscal 2013;

Ÿ

Revenue decreased 2.0 percent to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2014 from $5.1 billion in fiscal 2013; and

Ÿ

Income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.8 percent in fiscal 2014 from 9.1 percent in fiscal 2013.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below in this Report for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
activities, return on invested capital and return on average equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers:

Ÿ

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $849.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $833.0 million in fiscal 2013;

Ÿ

Return on invested capital (defined as after-tax operating income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of invested capital at
the beginning and ending of the fiscal year, where invested capital equals equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents) increased to 20.4 percent in fiscal 2014 from 17.1 percent in fiscal 2013; and

Ÿ

Return on average equity (defined as income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the beginning and ending of the
fiscal year) increased to 31.9 percent in fiscal 2014 from 26.6 percent in fiscal 2013.

Refer to
MD&A heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies” below in this Report for more information on net cash provided by operating activities.

Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Department of
Defense and Other U.S. Federal Markets:

U.S. Government budgets remained constrained in fiscal 2014, and we anticipate a similarly constrained spending environment in fiscal 2015. Contributing to the slow spending
environment and similar to U.S. Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2014, Congress has yet to pass the GFY 2015 appropriations bills. This means specific budget allocations by program have not been finalized, and if not passed by
October 1, 2014, we expect the U.S. Government will operate under a continuing resolution.

Deficit spending has caused
U.S. Government budgets to come under significant pressure. In particular, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, through budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending. In December
2013, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, modifying the budget caps and increasing the limits on discretionary defense spending for GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 by approximately $22 billion and $9 billion, respectively, with similar
spending relief for non-defense government spending. This resulted in a U.S. national defense spending cap of approximately $520 billion for GFY 2014 and approximately $521 billion for GFY 2015. Passing the 2-year, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013
provided more certainty in the budget planning process for both GFY 2014 and 2015 and gave the DoD flexibility in deciding priorities.

For GFYs 2016 through 2021, however, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 retained the previous budget caps and across-the-board spending reduction methodology as provided under the Budget Control Act of
2011, and as a result of the return to full sequestration, there remains uncertainty regarding how sequester cuts would be applied in GFY 2016 and beyond. Even under full sequestration, though, the national defense spending cap would be
approximately $523 billion for GFY 2016, which is higher than the cap for GFY 2015. Alternatively, under the President’s budget request dated March 2014, which ignores spending caps, national defense spending for GFY 2016 would also be higher
at approximately $535 billion.

Government Oversight and Risk:

As a U.S. Government
contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the
U.S. Government could make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able
to bid on, or from being awarded, new U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.



For a discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see
“Item 1. Business — Principal Customers; Government Contracts” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. We are also subject to other risks associated with U.S. Government business, including technological
uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

State and Local:

We also provide products to state and local government agencies that are
committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. The public safety market weakened during fiscal 2014, having concluded an upgrade cycle primarily related to the Federal Communications Commission’s narrow-banding mandate that drove
higher-than-average market demand. Future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation LTE solutions for high data-rate applications, an
emerging market in the early stages of development.

International:

We believe
there is continuing international demand for tactical radio and public safety communications for military, government, and commercial customers, as well as for turnkey managed satellite communications solutions for government, energy and maritime
markets. We believe we can leverage our domain expertise and proven technology provided in the U.S. for air traffic management, weather ground system technology and commercially hosted satellite payloads in pursuing international opportunities to
further expand our international business.

Commercial:

We are leveraging proven
technologies and capabilities for government applications into attractive commercial markets. After a long history of providing satellite antennas, space electronics, and payload technology to the government market, we are applying that same
technology and capability in the commercial space market. Similarly, we provide turnkey managed satellite communications solutions not only to government customers in remote and harsh locations but also for commercial energy and maritime customers.
After first addressing the government healthcare IT market, we began providing a full range of interoperability and business intelligence solutions to address the growing complexity in the commercial healthcare IT market. Also, an initiative is
underway to leverage our success in providing weather ground system technology for the government market into commercial markets such as agriculture, which relies heavily on advanced forecasting capabilities and other weather information.

We believe that our experience, technologies and capabilities are well aligned with the demand and requirements of the markets
noted above in this Report. However, we remain subject to the spending levels, pace and priorities of the U.S. Government as well as international governments and commercial customers, and to general economic conditions that could adversely affect
us, our customers and our suppliers. We also remain subject to other risks associated with these markets, including technological uncertainties, adoption of our new products and other risks that are discussed below in this Report under
“Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.



OPERATIONS REVIEW

Consolidated Results of Operations

*

Not meaningful

Revenue

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The decrease in revenue in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was
primarily due to lower revenue in our Integrated Network Solutions segment, while modestly lower revenue in our RF Communications segment offset modestly higher revenue in our Government Communications Systems segment. The $113 million decrease in
revenue in our Integrated Network Solutions segment was primarily due to lower revenue from U.S. Government customers across the segment.



Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

The decrease in revenue
in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower revenue in our RF Communications and Integrated Network Solutions segments. The $295 million decrease in revenue in our RF Communications segment was primarily due to lower Tactical
Communications revenue. The $34 million decrease in revenue in our Integrated Network Solutions segment was due to lower IT Services revenue, partially offset by moderate revenue growth in Harris CapRock Communications and our healthcare operations.

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further
information.

Gross Margin Percentage

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue (“gross margin percentage”) in fiscal 2014 was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2013
and primarily reflects a 1.0 percentage point increase in gross margin percentage in our Government Communications Systems segment resulting from good program execution, partially offset by a 0.7 percentage point decrease in gross margin percentage
in our RF Communications segment resulting from weakness at Public Safety and Professional Communications.

Fiscal 2013
Compared With Fiscal 2012:

The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a lower percentage of our overall sales generated by our higher-margin RF Communications
segment and a 1.9 percentage point decrease in gross margin percentage in our Integrated Network Solutions segment, partially offset by a 1.4 percentage point increase in gross margin percentage in our RF Communications segment.

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The decrease in engineering, selling and administrative (“ESA”) expenses and ESA expenses as a percentage of revenue
(“ESA percentage”) in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $74.7 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for company-wide restructuring and other actions and the benefit in fiscal 2014 from
prior-year restructuring actions, and an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our post-employment benefit plan that reduced general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher research and development
expenses.

Overall Company-sponsored research and development costs were $264.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared with
$254.1 million in fiscal 2013 (including a $17.8 million write-off of capitalized software in our Integrated Network Solutions segment, as described below).

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

The increase in ESA percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a 3.0 percentage point increase in ESA
percentage in our RF Communications segment, partially offset by a 2.5 percentage point decrease in ESA percentage in our Integrated Network Solutions segment. The increase in ESA percentage in our RF Communications segment was primarily driven by
ESA expenses in fiscal 2013 that were essentially flat with fiscal 2012 relative to a 14 percent decrease in segment revenue. Although benefiting from operational excellence initiatives and restructuring actions, RF Communications segment ESA
expenses in fiscal 2013 were higher primarily due to an 8 percent increase in spending on research and development compared with fiscal 2012 and also included a $9 million charge for restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The
decrease in ESA percentage in our Integrated Network Solutions segment was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, including the impact of ongoing cost-reduction efforts and $58 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2012 for
integration and other costs associated with our acquisitions of CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, partially offset by $44 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2013 for asset impairments and a $17.8 million write-off of capitalized software due
to a change in accounting estimate.

Overall Company-sponsored research and development costs were $254.1 million in
fiscal 2013 (including the $17.8 million write-off of capitalized software in our Integrated Network Solutions segment noted above) compared with $218.9 million in fiscal 2012.

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Non-Operating Income (Loss)

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

Non-operating income in fiscal 2014 was due to net income related to intellectual property matters. Non-operating loss in fiscal 2013
was primarily due to a $33.2 million charge associated with our optional redemption on May 28, 2013 of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 5%



Notes due October 1, 2015, a $10.8 million impairment of a cost-method investment and a $6.4 million impairment of an investment in a joint venture, partially offset by a $9.0 million gain
on the sale of securities available-for-sale.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal
2012:

Non-operating loss in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the items noted for fiscal 2013 in the discussion above regarding fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. Non-operating income in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to
royalty income related to certain patents.

See

Note 20: Non-Operating Income (Loss)

in the Notes for further
information.

Net Interest Expense

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

Our net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of our
optional redemption on May 28, 2013 of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 5% Notes due October 1, 2015.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

Our net interest expense decreased slightly in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of
our redemption of our 5% Notes as noted above in the discussion regarding fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013.

See

Note
17: Interest Expense

in the Notes for further information.

Income Taxes

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

In fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate benefited from additional
deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2013 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2013, the settlement of a state tax audit and additional permanent
deductions based on recent tax litigation unrelated to us. In fiscal 2013, legislation was enacted that restored the U.S. Federal income tax credit for qualifying research and development expenses. This resulted in a benefit of approximately $8.4
million (approximately 1.3 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes) in calculating our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes). In fiscal 2013, our effective
tax rate also benefited from additional deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) claimed on our fiscal 2012 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2012, favorable tax settlements, tax elections resulting in the
deductibility of certain expenses, a reduction in estimated non-U.S. tax liabilities, a reduction in state taxes due to changes in certain state tax laws and confirmation of the availability of certain acquired tax attributes due to audit
resolution.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

The major discrete items from which our
fiscal 2013 effective tax rate benefited are those noted for fiscal 2013 in the discussion above regarding fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2012, our effective tax rate benefited from additional tax credits and manufacturing
deductions claimed on our fiscal 2011 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2011, as well as from a reduction in state taxes due to changes in certain state tax laws and a reduction in estimated tax liabilities.

See

Note 21: Income Taxes

in the Notes for further information.

Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

Discontinued operations in fiscal 2014 consisted of a $6.9 million after-tax increase in the loss on sale of Broadcast Communications
from miscellaneous adjustments for contingencies related to the disposition, partially offset by a $1.9 million after-tax gain on sale of the remaining assets of CIS. Discontinued operations in fiscal 2013 included a loss of $32.7 million ($32.2
million after-tax) on the sale of Broadcast Communications in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as non-cash impairment charges totaling $314.4 million ($297.3 million after-tax) recorded during the first two quarters of fiscal 2013 related
to Broadcast Communications based on indicators of value, including financial performance, market conditions, indications of value from interested parties and our entering into a definitive Asset Sale Agreement relating to the sale of Broadcast
Communications. Additionally, based on market indications during fiscal 2013, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $16.5 million ($10.1 million after-tax) to write down assets of CIS to their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to
sell.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

Discontinued operations in fiscal 2013 included the
items noted for fiscal 2013 in the discussion above regarding fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. Discontinued operations in fiscal 2012 included non-cash impairment charges totaling $447.6 million ($417.0 million after-tax) related to Broadcast
Communications and charges of $142.6 million ($90.2 million after-tax) for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets and for exit and disposal costs related to CIS.

Income From Continuing Operations Per Diluted Common Share Attributable to Harris Corporation Common
Shareholders

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The increase in income from continuing
operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2014 compared with the fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the same reasons noted in the discussions above in this MD&A regarding fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 and by the reduction in average
common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal
2012:

The decrease in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2013 compared with the fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the same reasons noted in the discussions above in this MD&A regarding
fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012, partially offset by the reduction in average common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased.

See the “Common Stock Repurchases” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations

RF Communications Segment

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

Segment revenue in fiscal 2014
included Tactical Communications revenue of $1,307.2 million, a 4 percent increase from $1,255.5 million in fiscal 2013; and Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue of $520.8 million, a 12 percent decrease from $593.5 million in fiscal
2013. The increase in Tactical Communications revenue was primarily due to higher revenue in international markets, mostly offset by lower revenue from DoD customers. The decrease in Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was
primarily due to continued market weakness.

The decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2014 compared with
fiscal 2013 was primarily due to weakness in Public Safety and Professional Communications and a $7 million benefit from the cumulative effect of a correction made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in the timing of cost recognition on
tactical radio programs. The decrease in segment ESA percentage in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by a $9 million charge for restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and an out-of-period adjustment in
the third quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our post-employment benefit plan that reduced segment general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an 8 percent increase in spending on research and development and the impact of accruals in
the first quarter of fiscal 2014 for legal matters related to a Public Safety and Professional Communications program. The decrease in segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin percentage”)
in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.

Segment orders were $1.63
billion for fiscal 2014, including $1.13 billion in Tactical Communications and $497 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications, compared with $1.90 billion for fiscal 2013, including $1.34 billion in Tactical Communications and $562
million in Public Safety and Professional Communications. Segment funded backlog was $1.13 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, including $564 million in Tactical Communications and $570 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications,
compared with $1.34 billion at the end of fiscal 2013, including $743 million in Tactical Communications and $598 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales
funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 46 percent in fiscal 2014 and 43 percent in fiscal 2013.



Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

Segment revenue in
fiscal 2013 included Tactical Communications revenue of $1,255.5 million, a 20 percent decrease from $1,570.4 million in fiscal 2012; and Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue of $593.5 million, a 3 percent increase from $573.7
million in fiscal 2012. The decrease in Tactical Communications revenue reflects the impact of U.S. and international tactical radio procurement delays due to the slowdown in spending resulting from U.S. Government funding constraints experienced
under the continuing resolution and magnified when sequestration was triggered, as well as key order delays in the international market.

The increase in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by a favorable product mix within Tactical Communications and a $7 million benefit from the
cumulative effect of a correction made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in the timing of cost recognition on tactical radio programs. The increase in segment ESA percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by
segment ESA expenses that were only slightly higher compared with fiscal 2012 relative to a 14 percent decrease in segment revenue. Although benefiting from operational excellence initiatives and restructuring actions, segment ESA expenses in fiscal
2013 were slightly higher primarily due to an 8 percent increase in spending on research and development compared with fiscal 2012 and also included a $9 million charge for restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The decrease in
segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 and was primarily due to the decrease in revenue in Tactical
Communications.

Segment orders were $1.90 billion for fiscal 2013, including $1.34 billion in Tactical Communications and
$562 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications, compared with $1.94 billion for fiscal 2012, including $1.47 billion in Tactical Communications and $468 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications. Segment funded
backlog was $1.34 billion at the end of fiscal 2013, including $743 million in Tactical Communications and $598 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications, compared with $1.30 billion at the end of fiscal 2012, including $665 million
in Tactical Communications and $635 million in Public Safety and Professional Communications.

The percentage of this
segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through
prime contractors, was approximately 43 percent in fiscal 2013 and 46 percent in fiscal 2012.

Integrated Network
Solutions Segment

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The $113 million decrease in segment
revenue in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to lower revenue from U.S. Government customers in both IT Services and Harris CapRock Communications, partially offset by higher revenue from commercial customers in Harris CapRock
Communications and our healthcare operations.

The slight decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2014 compared
with fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to an out-of-period adjustment made to revenue and cost of sales for satellite and terrestrial communications services and margin pressure from a competitive market environment, mostly offset by increases
in gross margin percentage on satellite and terrestrial communications services due to operational excellence improvements. The decrease in segment ESA percentage in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $44 million of charges
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for asset impairments and a write-off of capitalized



software due to a change in accounting estimate, and an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our post-employment benefit plan that reduced segment general and
administrative expenses, as well as operational excellence improvements, including the benefit of restructuring actions in fiscal 2013. The increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal
2013 were attributable to the decrease in segment ESA percentage, partially offset by the decrease in segment gross margin percentage, as discussed above regarding this segment.

Segment orders were $1.53 billion for fiscal 2014 compared with $1.57 billion for fiscal 2013. The percentage of this segment’s
revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
contractors, was approximately 60 percent in fiscal 2014 and 62 percent in fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2013 Compared
With Fiscal 2012:

The decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an 11 percent decrease in IT Services revenue, primarily from the loss of the Patriot program, partially
offset by revenue growth in Harris CapRock Communications and our healthcare operations of 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively.

The decrease in segment gross margin and gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross margin percentage on satellite and terrestrial
communications services, increased costs associated with delivering software products and increased costs on a service contract with a government healthcare customer. The decreases in segment ESA expenses and ESA percentage in fiscal 2013 compared
with fiscal 2012 were primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, including the impact of ongoing cost-reduction efforts and $58 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2012 for integration and other costs associated with our
acquisitions of CapRock, Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, partially offset by $44 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2013 for asset impairments and a write-off of capitalized software due to a change in accounting estimate. The increases in segment
operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 were attributable to the decreases in segment ESA expenses and ESA percentage, partially offset by the decrease in segment gross margin percentage, as
discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012.

Segment orders were $1.57 billion for
fiscal 2013 compared with $1.78 billion for fiscal 2012. The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 62 percent in fiscal 2013 and 66 percent in fiscal 2012.

Government Communications Systems Segment

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The $17 million increase in segment
revenue in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher revenue from classified customers, the FAA NextGen DataComm program, the U.S. Army MET program, the F-35 program and the wireless products business, partially offset by
lower revenue from the NOAA GOES-R weather program.

The 1.0 percentage point increase in segment gross margin percentage in
fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to continued strong program performance, including retirement of risk on certain space programs. The slight decrease in segment ESA percentage in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was
primarily driven by an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our post-employment benefit plan that reduced segment general and administrative expenses, as well as operational excellence improvements and the benefit
of



restructuring actions in fiscal 2013, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. The increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2014
compared with fiscal 2013 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.

Segment orders were $1.78 billion
for fiscal 2014 and $1.90 billion for fiscal 2013. The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 93 percent in fiscal 2014 and approximately 93 percent in fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal 2012:

Segment revenue in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 decreased
slightly, primarily due to lower revenue from DoD customers and from certain classified programs that were impacted by sequestration, mostly offset by higher revenue from the SGSS program for NASA and ADS-B receiver payloads for Aireon, LLC.

Segment operating margin percentage was essentially flat in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012. The slight increase in
segment gross margin percentage, primarily driven by strong program performance, including the retirement of risk on certain space programs, was offset by slightly higher segment ESA percentage, primarily from a $10 million charge associated with
Company-wide restructuring and other actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

Segment orders were $1.90 billion for
fiscal 2013 and $1.87 billion for fiscal 2012. The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales
funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 93 percent in fiscal 2013 and approximately 97 percent in fiscal 2012.

Unallocated Corporate Expense and Corporate Eliminations

Fiscal 2014 Compared With Fiscal 2013:

The decrease in unallocated corporate
expense in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a $21 million charge associated with Company-wide restructuring and other actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as noted below regarding fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal
2012, and the benefit in fiscal 2014 from prior year restructuring actions. The increase in corporate eliminations in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher intersegment eliminations for sales of services between our
Integrated Network Solutions segment and our Government Communications Systems segment.

Fiscal 2013 Compared With Fiscal
2012:

The increase in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $21 million charge associated with Company-wide restructuring and other actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2013, including facility consolidation, asset impairments, workforce reductions and other associated costs, partially offset by lower expenses resulting from cost-reduction actions in fiscal 2012 and savings from operational excellence initiatives
in fiscal 2013. The increase in corporate eliminations in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to higher intersegment sales between IT Services in our Integrated Network Solutions segment and our Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL STRATEGIES

Cash Flows



Cash and cash equivalents:

Our Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows includes cash flows related to Broadcast Communications and CIS, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of fiscal 2013 reflects CIS as discontinued operations. However, other than proceeds related to the sale of Broadcast
Communications and CIS and net additions of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software related to Broadcast Communications and CIS disclosed at “Net cash used in investing activities” below, the impact of cash flows related to
Broadcast Communications and CIS to our consolidated cash flows was not material.

The $240.0 million increase in cash and cash
equivalents from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to $849.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $141.3 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and $42.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of
discontinued operations, partially offset by $309.4 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $201.3 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment, $180.3 million used to pay cash dividends and $99.7 million used for
net repayments of borrowings. The $35.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $414.9 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $346.4 million used for net repayments of
borrowings, $178.2 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software and $164.7 million used to pay cash dividends, mostly offset by $833.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $147.4 million
of net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and $97.9 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options.

Our financial position remained strong at June 27, 2014. We ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $561.0 million;
we have no long-term debt maturing until December 1, 2017; we have a senior unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility that expires in September 2017 (all of which was available to us as of June 27, 2014); and we do not have any
material defined benefit pension plan obligations. Our $561.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 27, 2014 included $188 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, $134 million of which was available for use in the U.S. without
incurring additional U.S. income taxes. We would be required to recognize U.S. income taxes of $16 million on the remaining $54 million if we were to repatriate such funds to the U.S., but we have no current plans to repatriate such funds.

Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash
needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of the U.S. Government budget
uncertainties and the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.

We also currently believe that existing cash, funds
generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under
our share repurchase program and potential acquisitions for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. We anticipate tax payments over the next three years to be approximately equal to our tax expense for the same
period. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see

Note 21: Income Taxes

in the Notes. Other than those cash outlays noted in the “Contractual Obligations” discussion below in this MD&A, capital expenditures,
dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and potential acquisitions, no other significant cash outlays are anticipated in fiscal 2015.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper
program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital markets disruptions. If we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our
obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or
obtain additional financing. Our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
affecting the defense, government and integrated communications and information technology and services markets and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities:

Our net cash provided by operating activities was
consistently high in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, reflecting solid earnings and good working capital management. Cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Net cash used in investing activities:

The $142.9 million increase in net cash used in investing
activities in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $105.4 million less of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations (consisting of, for fiscal 2014, $27.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of CIS and $15.0 million
of proceeds from payment of a note receivable related to the sale of Broadcast Communications, compared



with $147.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of Broadcast Communications in fiscal 2013), as well as $23.1 million more used for net additions of property, plant and equipment and
capitalized software that primarily reflected investments in new systems and infrastructure to support growth. The $229.2 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to $147.4
million more of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations (consisting of the net proceeds from the sale of Broadcast Communications in fiscal 2013) and $55.6 million less used for net additions of property, plant and equipment and
capitalized software that primarily reflected $37.2 million less used for net additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software related to Broadcast Communications and CIS. Our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 are expected
to be approximately $200 million.

Net cash used in financing activities:

The $391.6
million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $246.7 million less of net repayments of borrowings (primarily reflecting $332.2 million used for our optional redemption on
May 28, 2013 of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 5% Notes due October 1, 2015), $105.5 million less of repurchases of our common stock and $43.4 million more of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options,
partially offset by $15.6 million more used to pay cash dividends. The $229.9 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to $321.5 million more of net repayments of borrowings
(primarily reflecting $332.2 million used for our redemption of our 5% Notes as noted above) and $25.1 million more used to pay cash dividends, partially offset by $69.7 million more of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and $58.6
million less of repurchases of our common stock.

Common Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2014, we used $300.0 million to repurchase 4,560,802 shares of our common stock under our repurchase program at an
average price per share of $65.78, including commissions. During fiscal 2013, we used $400.0 million (including proceeds from our sale of Broadcast Communications) to repurchase 8,287,130 shares of our common stock under our repurchase
program at an average price per share of $48.27, including commissions. In fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, $8.8 million and $14.9 million, respectively, in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy
withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we used $0.6 million to repurchase 8,000 shares of our common stock from our Rabbi Trust which is associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Shares
repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.

On August 23, 2013, our Board of Directors approved our new $1 billion
2013 Repurchase Program, which was in addition to our prior 2011 Repurchase Program. Our repurchases during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 used the remaining authorization under our 2011 Repurchase Program. As of June 27, 2014, we had a
remaining, unused authorization of approximately $834 million under our 2013 Repurchase Program, which does not have a stated expiration date. Our repurchase programs have resulted, and our 2013 Repurchase Program is expected to continue to result,
in repurchases in excess of the dilutive effect of shares issued under our share-based incentive plans. However, the level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows,
results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash and commercial paper and may be made through open market purchases, private
transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. The timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our
discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Additional information regarding repurchases during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 and our repurchase programs is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Dividends

On August 23, 2014, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.42 per share to $.47
per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $1.88 per share, which was our thirteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash dividend rate was $1.68 per share in fiscal 2014 and $1.48 per share in
fiscal 2013. Our annualized cash dividend rate was $1.32 per share for the last two quarters of fiscal 2012 and $1.12 per share for the first two quarters of fiscal 2012. There can be no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will
continue to increase. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future
dividends. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors that our Board
of Directors may deem relevant. Additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of
this Report.



Capital Structure and Resources

2012 Credit Agreement:

As discussed in

Note 11: Credit Arrangements

in the Notes, on
September 28, 2012, we established a new $1 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2012 Credit Facility”) by entering into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “2012 Credit Agreement”) with a
syndicate of lenders. The 2012 Credit Facility replaced our prior revolving credit facilities. The description of the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Credit Agreement set forth in

Note 11: Credit Arrangements

in the Notes is incorporated
herein by reference.

Short-Term Debt:

Our short-term debt at June 27, 2014 and
June 28, 2013 was $58.3 million and $144.6 million, respectively. Our short-term debt at June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013 primarily consisted of commercial paper issued to partially fund our optional redemption on May 28,
2013 of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 5% Notes due October 1, 2015. Our commercial paper program was supported at June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013 by the 2012 Credit Facility.

Long-Term Debt:

The description of our long-term debt set forth in

Note 13: Long-Term Debt

in
the Notes is incorporated herein by reference. As discussed in

Note 13: Long-Term Debt

in the Notes, on May 28, 2013, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 5% Notes due
October 1, 2015 at a “make-whole” redemption price of $332.2 million as set forth in the 5% Notes, which were terminated and cancelled.

Other:

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2013, related to the potential future
issuance of an indeterminate amount of securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities, preferred stock or common
stock.

We expect to maintain operating ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient for retention
of, or improvement to, our current debt ratings. There are no assurances that our debt ratings will not be reduced in the future. If our debt ratings are lowered below “investment grade,” we may not be able to issue short-term commercial
paper, but may instead need to borrow under our credit facility or pursue other options. In addition, if our debt ratings are lowered to below “investment grade,” we may also be required to provide collateral to support a portion of our
outstanding performance bonds. For a discussion of such performance bonds, see the “Commercial Commitments” discussion below. We do not currently expect a downgrade of our current debt ratings, but no assurances can be given. If our debt
ratings are downgraded, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets and our ability to receive certain types of contract awards.

Contractual Obligations

At June 27, 2014, we had contractual cash
obligations to repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:

(1)

Amounts do not include pension contributions and payments for various welfare and benefit plans because such amounts had not been determined beyond fiscal 2014.

(2)

The purchase obligations of $1,196.9 million included (a) $344.9 million of purchase obligations related to our Government Communications Systems
segment, which were fully funded under contracts with the U.S. Government, and $66.8 million of these purchase obligations related to cost-plus type contracts where our costs were fully reimbursable; and (b) the purchase of satellite
bandwidth in our Integrated Network Solutions segment.

(3)

Amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of $71.9 million.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

Ÿ

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

Ÿ

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market
risk support to that entity for such assets;

Ÿ

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain derivative instruments; and

Ÿ

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant.

Currently we are not participating in any material transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. As of June 27, 2014, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, we are not currently a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. In connection with these
divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability from such
representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions,
restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. We believe
that the financial risk of default by such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Commercial Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the
normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products
and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. At June 27, 2014, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:

The surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to Public Safety
and Professional Communications. As is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance,
warranty and other purposes (collectively, “Performance Bonds”). Such Performance Bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek



redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. Typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a Performance Bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project
contract. In such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the Performance Bond for the amounts paid. It has been rare for our Public Safety and Professional Communications business to have a Performance
Bond drawn upon. In addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure Performance Bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below “investment grade,” we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding
amount of Performance Bonds. Such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of Performance Bonds and could make it more difficult to procure Performance Bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. Such
collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. In addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability
to obtain Performance Bonds and may result in higher funding costs.

Financial Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in
interest rates. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
commitments. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent change
in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at June 27, 2014 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. This quantification of exposure to the
market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. See

Note 19: Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

in the Notes for additional information.

Interest
Rates:

As of June 27, 2014, we had long-term debt obligations. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for our
long-term debt obligations at June 27, 2014 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such long-term debt obligations. Additionally, there is no interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt obligations on our results of
operations and cash flows, because the interest rates on our long-term debt obligations are fixed, and because our long-term debt is not putable (redeemable at the option of the holders of the debt prior to maturity).

As of June 27, 2014, we also had short-term variable-rate debt outstanding, primarily under our commercial paper program, subject to
interest rate risk. We utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases
under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. The interest rate risk associated with this short-term debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material.

We can give no assurances, however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our
long-term debt obligations or on our results of operations or cash flows over the next twelve months.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 28 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2014
compared with 32 percent in fiscal 2013. The impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to U.S. dollars is included as a component of shareholders’ equity. As of June 27, 2014, the cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustment included in shareholders’ equity was a $6.6 million gain compared with a $27.2 million loss at June 28, 2013. We utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of
international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed
the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross
margin, revenue or operating income in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting
policies are more fully described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates
as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting
results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any
associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of
the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation of this Report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing
our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on
experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem
“critical.”

Revenue Recognition

A significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. Revenue and profits related to development and production contracts are recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method, generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion (i.e., the “cost-to-cost” method) with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated profit. The majority of
the revenue in our Government Communications Systems segment (and to a certain extent, revenue in our Integrated Network Solutions segment) relates to development and production contracts, and the percentage-of-completion method of revenue
recognition is primarily used for these contracts. Change orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a development and production contract are included in contract value only when the value can be reliably estimated and realization
is probable. Possible incentives or penalties and award fees applicable to performance on development and production contracts are considered in estimating contract value and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to
assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs.

Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each
development and production contract over its period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress toward completion. The
estimated profit or loss on a development and production contract is equal to the difference between the estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the
estimated total cost at completion often requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance, the risk and
impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims outside the original development and production contract included in the estimate to complete. At the outset of each contract,
we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard estimate at completion process in which
management reviews the progress and performance on our ongoing development and production contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a
contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. Additionally, at the
outset of a cost-reimbursable contract (for example, contracts containing award or incentive fees), we establish an estimate of total contract value, or revenue, based on our expectation of performance on the contract. As the cost-reimbursable
contract progresses, our estimates of total contract value may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive higher or lower than expected award fees. When adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimates of total contract value
are determined, the related impact to operating income is recognized



using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. Anticipated losses on development and production
contracts or programs in progress are charged to operating income when identified. We have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to estimate our costs related to
development and production contracts in the past three fiscal years.

Estimate at completion adjustments had the following
impacts to operating income for the periods presented:

There were no individual impacts to operating income due to estimate at completion adjustments in fiscal
2014, 2013 or 2012 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.

We
also recognize revenue from arrangements requiring the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale. In these arrangements, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and the timing of revenue recognition for each deliverable. If we determine that individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we
recognize the revenue associated with each unit of accounting separately, and contract revenue is allocated among the separate units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on relative selling price. If options or change orders
materially change the scope of work or price of the contract subsequent to inception, we reevaluate and adjust our prior conclusions regarding units of accounting and allocation of contract revenue as necessary. The allocation of selling price among
the separate units of accounting may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. We establish the selling price used for each deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective
evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, or third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price (“BESP”) if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of
selling price is available. In determining VSOE of selling price, a substantial majority of the recent standalone sales of the deliverable must be priced within a relatively narrow range. In determining TPE of selling price, we evaluate competitor
prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, comparable pricing of our products to those of our competitors with similar functionality cannot be obtained. In determining BESP, we consider both market data and entity-specific
factors, including market conditions, the geographies in which our products are sold, our competitive position and strategy, and our profit objectives.

Provisions for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory
at the lower of cost or market. We balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer requirements. We regularly
review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The review of excess and obsolete
inventory applies to all of our business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product line, technological change and new product development. These factors could result in a
change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete
inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in the “Cost of product sales” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such determination. In
the case of goods which have been written down below cost, such reduced amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. We have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our inventory loss
reserves during the past three fiscal years.

As of June 27, 2014, our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was
$38.0 million, or 12 percent of our gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of $35.8 million, or 11 percent of our gross inventory balance, as of June 28, 2013. We recorded $4.8 million, $6.7 million
and $10.8 million in inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations before income taxes during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Although we make
reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, including the impact of planned future product launches, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant
impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.



Goodwill

Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013 was $1,711.2 million and $1,692.0 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized. We perform annual (or
under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill using a two-step process. The first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its net book value, including
goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the
impairment test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount
of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting
unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months’ sales and earnings of our reporting units.
Projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using
an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. The sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses,
and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and
outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable. We have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the assessment of whether or not goodwill is
impaired.

Fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 Impairment Tests

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, we performed our annual impairment tests of our reporting units’ goodwill. We completed these tests with no adjustment required to the goodwill of
any of our reporting units. For all of our reporting units, the fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the reporting unit’s adjusted net book value by a substantial margin. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

in the
Notes for information regarding impairments related to Broadcast Communications goodwill.

Income Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals
of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2014 included current deferred tax assets of $112.2 million, non-current deferred
tax assets of $87.3 million and current deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 million. This compares with current deferred tax assets of $121.2 million, non-current deferred tax assets of $124.8 million and current deferred tax liabilities
of $1.8 million as of June 28, 2013. For all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these
tax assets. Our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $68.2 million as of June 27, 2014 and $74.1 million as of June 28, 2013. Although we make reasonable
efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or
time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion
of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.



Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in

Note 2:
Accounting Changes or Recent Accounting Pronouncements

in the Notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections. Other factors besides those
listed here also could adversely affect us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report for more information regarding factors that might cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Report.

Ÿ

We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S.
Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Ÿ

We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily
regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Ÿ

We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT
networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.

Ÿ

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.

Ÿ

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including
fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Ÿ

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

The continued effects of the general weakness in the global economy and the U.S. Government’s budget deficits and national debt and sequestration
could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Ÿ

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current
and future markets.

Ÿ

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a
result, future income and expenditures.

Ÿ

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure
against risks, our operations or our profitability.

Ÿ

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

Ÿ

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or
services, could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

Ÿ

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property
rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.

Ÿ

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Ÿ

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.

Ÿ

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes in the regulatory framework under which our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations are operated could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Ÿ

We rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions, and any bandwidth
constraints could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Ÿ

Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become
impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.

Ÿ

We must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an appropriate cost-benefit analysis,
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

(1992 framework). Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2014.

The Company’s independent registered certified public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 54 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation as of June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013, and
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Harris Corporation at June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2014, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated August 25, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2014, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Harris Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation as of June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2014 of Harris Corporation and our report dated August 25, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Harris
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (these “Notes”), the terms “Harris,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to
Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intracompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for information regarding discontinued operations. Except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes
relate solely to our continuing operations.

At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, to leverage the breadth of
our information technology (“IT”) enterprise network and information assurance capabilities for the IT services market, we began managing our cyber security network testing operation as part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment
rather than our Government Communications Systems segment. As a result, we reassigned $2.4 million of goodwill (determined on a relative fair value basis) to our Integrated Network Solutions segment from our Government Communications Systems
segment. The historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this change to our business segment reporting
structure for all periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes.

Use of
Estimates

— Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
These estimates and assumptions are based on experience and other information available prior to issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes
known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 each
included 52 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents are temporary cash investments with a
maturity of three or fewer months when purchased. These investments include accrued interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, non-current receivables, notes
receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their fair values. Fair values for long-term debt are primarily based on quoted market prices for those or similar instruments. See

Note 22: Fair Value Measurements

for additional
information regarding fair values for our long-term debt. A discussion of fair values for our derivative financial instruments is included under the caption “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this

Note 1: Significant
Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at net realizable value and they
generally do not bear interest. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances which is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this
allowance based on our history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic status of the customers. We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded at the time
a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. See

Note 5: Receivables

for additional information regarding accounts receivable.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a
provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. See

Note 6: Inventories

for additional information regarding
inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant and equipment are carried on the basis of cost
and include software capitalized for internal use. Depreciation of buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful lives of buildings, including leasehold improvements, generally
range between 2 and 45 years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally range between 2 and 10 years. Amortization of internal-use software begins when the software is put into service and is based on the expected
useful life of the software. The useful lives over which we amortize internal-use software generally range between 3 and 7 years. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

for additional information regarding property, plant and
equipment.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Goodwill

— Goodwill is not amortized. We perform annual (or under
certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill using a two-step process. The first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its net book value, including
goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the
impairment test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount
of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting
unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill

and

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for additional
information regarding goodwill.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Finite-Lived Intangible Assets

— Long-lived
assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

and

Note 9:
Intangible Assets

for additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets.

In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges totaling $34.7 million related to long-lived assets. These included an impairment in our Integrated Network Solutions segment related to intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of
Carefx Corporation (“Carefx”) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily resulting from a shift in strategy away from Carefx’s legacy products; an impairment in our Integrated Network Solutions segment related to an IT services
contract vehicle, primarily based on impacts of sequestration and a new rule incorporated into the contract vehicle limiting bid opportunities for large businesses; and an impairment of other Company-owned assets based on recent market indications.

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No assets within the “Other current assets” line item in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our total current assets as of June 27, 2014 or June 28, 2013. No assets within the “Other non-current assets” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded
5 percent of our total assets as of June 27, 2014 or June 28, 2013. No accrued liabilities or expenses within the “Other accrued items” or “Other long-term liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
exceeded 5 percent of our total current liabilities or total liabilities, respectively, as of June 27, 2014 or June 28, 2013.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets
recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. See

Note 21: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production contract sales in our Government Communications Systems segment and in our Integrated Network Solutions segment, the value or price of our
warranty is generally included in the contract and funded by the customer. A provision for warranties is built into the estimated program costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when applying the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion
revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are charged to the specific program’s cost, and both revenue and cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the estimated program cost for warranties include terms of the
contract, complexity of the delivered product or service, number of installed units, historical experience and management’s assumptions regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On product sales in all our segments, we provide for future standard warranty costs upon
product delivery. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending on the product sold, customer and country in which we do business. In the case of products sold by us, our warranties start from the shipment, delivery or
customer acceptance date and continue as follows:

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to customer specifications and their acceptance is
based on meeting those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical experience, anticipated delays in delivery of products to
end customers, in-country support for international sales and management’s assumptions regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
adjustments to the liability as necessary. See

Note 10: Accrued Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional currency for most international subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange and
income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

— We measure compensation cost for all share-based payments (including
employee stock options) at fair value and recognize cost over the vesting period. It is our practice to issue shares when options are exercised. See

Note 14: Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

for additional information
regarding share-based compensation.

Restructuring Costs

— We record restructuring charges for sales or
terminations of product lines, closures or relocations of business activities, changes in management structure, and fundamental reorganizations that affect the nature and focus of operations. Such costs include one-time termination benefits,
contract termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. We record these charges at their fair value when incurred. In cases where employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive
the termination benefits and will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, we record the expense ratably over the future service period. These charges are included as a component of the “Cost of product sales” and
“Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line items in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

In connection
with Company-wide restructuring and other actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to align resources with our business outlook and challenging fiscal environment, we incurred restructuring costs, net of government cost reimbursement, of
$16.6 million for workforce reductions (including severance and other employee-related exit costs) and $12.1 million for facility consolidation. This resulted in charges of $9.2 million, $0.4 million, $6.5 million and
$12.6 million in our RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications Systems segments and at our corporate headquarters, respectively. As of the end of fiscal 2013, we had recorded liabilities of $26.0 million
associated with these restructuring actions, of which the majority was paid during fiscal 2014.

Revenue
Recognition

— Our segments have the following revenue recognition policies:

Development and Production
Contracts:

Estimates and assumptions, and changes therein, are important in connection with, among others, our segments’ revenue recognition policies related to development and production contracts. Revenue and
profits related to development and production contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion (i.e., the cost-to-cost method) with
consideration given for risk of performance and estimated profit. Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable development and production contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, and become billable to the customer, in
an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs.

Development and production contracts are combined when
specific aggregation criteria are met. Criteria generally include closely interrelated activities performed for a single customer within the same economic environment. Development and production contracts are generally not segmented. If development
and production contracts are segmented, we have determined that they meet specific segmenting criteria. Change orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a development and production contract are included in contract value only when
the value can



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Possible incentives or penalties and award fees applicable to performance on development and production contracts are considered in estimating
contract value and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized
until the event occurs.

Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
used to recognize profit for each development and production contract over its period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of the total cost at completion and the measurement of
progress toward completion. The estimated profit or loss on a development and production contract is equal to the difference between the estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our
programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor
performance, the risk and impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims outside the original development and production contract included in the estimate to complete. At the
outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard Estimate at
Completion (“EAC”) process in which management reviews the progress and performance on our ongoing development and production contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If we successfully retire risks associated with
the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated
total cost at completion. Additionally, at the outset of a cost-reimbursable contract (for example, contracts containing award or incentive fees), we establish an estimate of total contract value, or revenue, based on our expectation of performance
on the contract. As the cost-reimbursable contract progresses, our estimates of total contract value may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive higher or lower than expected award fees. When adjustments in estimated total costs at
completion or in estimates of total contract value are determined, the related impact to operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all
prior periods. Anticipated losses on development and production contracts or programs in progress are charged to operating income when identified. Net EAC adjustments resulting from changes in estimates favorably impacted our operating income by
$53.3 million ($.33 per diluted share) in fiscal 2014, $47.1 million ($.29 per diluted share) in fiscal 2013 and $38.4 million ($.20 per diluted share) in fiscal 2012.

Products and Services Other Than Development and Production Contracts:

Revenue from product sales other than development and production contracts and revenue from service
arrangements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and delivery of a product has occurred and title has transferred or services have been rendered.
Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts. Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless these
obligations are satisfied.

Multiple-Element Arrangements:

We have entered into arrangements
other than development and production contracts that require the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale. These arrangements are most prevalent in our RF Communications and Integrated Network Solutions
segments. For example, in our RF Communications segment, in addition to delivering secure tactical radios and accessories, we may be required to perform or provide installation, design and development solutions for custom communication
infrastructures, and extended warranties. In our Integrated Network Solutions segment, the deliverables to our maritime customers may include satellite bandwidth services (voice, data and internet), terrestrial circuits, equipment, installation, and
network operations center and other support services.

For arrangements with multiple elements, judgment is required to
determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and the timing of revenue recognition for each deliverable. We recognize revenue for
contractual deliverables as separate units of accounting when the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis (i.e., if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a standalone
basis) and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, we consider delivery or performance of the undelivered items as probable and substantially in our control.

Deliverables that are not separable are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting, and revenue generally is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and delivery of a product has occurred and title has transferred or services have been rendered. If we



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

determine that the deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we recognize the revenue associated with each unit of accounting separately, and contract revenue is allocated among the
separate units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on relative selling price. If options or change orders materially change the scope of work or price of the contract subsequent to inception, we reevaluate and adjust our prior
conclusions regarding units of accounting and allocation of contract revenue as necessary. The allocation of selling price among the separate units of accounting may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue
recognized on the arrangement. We establish the selling price used for each deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, or third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price if VSOE of
selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price (“BESP”) if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price is available. In determining VSOE of selling price, a substantial majority of the recent standalone sales
of the deliverable must be priced within a relatively narrow range. In determining TPE of selling price, we evaluate competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, comparable pricing of our products to those of our
competitors with similar functionality cannot be obtained. In determining BESP, we consider both market data and entity-specific factors, including market conditions, the geographies in which our products are sold, our competitive position and
strategy, and our profit objectives.

Bill-and-Hold Arrangements:

Certain contracts include terms
and conditions through which we recognize revenue upon completion of equipment production, which is subsequently stored at our location at the customer’s request. Revenue is recognized on such contracts upon the customer’s assumption of
title and risk of ownership and when collectibility is reasonably assured. At the time of revenue recognition, there is a schedule of delivery of the product consistent with the customer’s business practices, the product has been separated from
our inventory, and we do not have any remaining performance obligations such that the earnings process is not complete.

Other:

Net income or expense related to intellectual property matters is included as a component of the
“Non-operating income (loss)” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis of terms specified in contractual agreements. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in the “Revenue
from product sales” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and the associated costs are included in the “Cost of product sales” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Also, we record taxes collected from
customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from revenues.

Retirement and
Post-Employment Benefits

— As of June 27, 2014, we provide retirement benefits to substantially all U.S.-based employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement plan that includes a 401(k) plan and certain
non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The defined contribution retirement plan has matching and savings elements. Contributions by us to the retirement plan are based on employees’ savings with no other funding requirements. We may make
additional contributions to the retirement plan at our discretion. Retirement and post-employment benefits also include a defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom that is closed to new participants and an unfunded limited healthcare plan for
U.S.-based retirees and employees on long-term disability. We estimate benefits for these plans using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the rates of increase in future compensation levels, healthcare cost trend rates and employee turnover and mortality, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans. We accrue the cost of these benefits during an
employee’s active service life, except in the case of our healthcare plan for disabled employees, the costs of which we accrue when the disabling event occurs.

Retirement and post-employment benefit expenses amounted to $46.6 million in fiscal 2014, $49.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $47.4 million in fiscal 2012.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that relate to past operations when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 14 sites where future liabilities could exist. These sites include 1 site owned by us,
9 sites associated with our former graphics, broadcast communications or semiconductor locations, and 4 treatment or disposal sites not owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly attributable to us from past operations. Based on an
assessment of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) and other environmental statutes and
regulations for identified sites, using an 8.5 percent discount rate, is approximately $5.1 million. The current portion of this liability is included in the “Other accrued items” line item and the non-current portion is included
in the “Other long-term liabilities” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The estimated aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next 10 years is approximately $7.7 million. The estimated payments for
the next five years are approximately $0.8 million per year, and the aggregate amount thereafter is approximately $3.6 million. The relevant factors we considered in estimating our potential liabilities under



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations include cost-sharing agreements with other parties and potential indemnification from successor and predecessor owners of these
sites. We do not believe that any uncertainties regarding these relevant factors will materially affect our potential liability under the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial Commitments

— Financial guarantees are contingent commitments issued to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. As of June 27, 2014, there were no such contingent commitments accrued for in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby
letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers and to obtain insurance
policies with our insurance carriers. As of June 27, 2014, we had total commercial commitments, including performance guarantees, of $727.4 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

— In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks and formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions.
We recognize all derivatives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

for additional information
regarding our use of derivative instruments.

Income From Continuing Operations Per Share

— For all periods
presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes, income from continuing operations per share is computed using the two-class method. The two-class method of computing income from continuing operations per share is an earnings
allocation formula that determines income from continuing operations per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends paid and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Our restricted stock awards and
restricted stock unit awards meet the definition of participating securities and are included in the computations of income from continuing operations per basic and diluted common share. Our performance share awards and performance share unit awards
do not meet the definition of participating securities because they do not contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends and, therefore, are excluded from the computations of income from continuing operations per basic and diluted common share.
Under the two-class method, income from continuing operations per common share is computed by dividing the sum of earnings distributed to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Income from continuing operations per diluted common share is computed using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury stock method. In applying the two-class method, undistributed
earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. See

Note 15: Income From Continuing Operations Per Share

for additional information.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING CHANGES OR RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we adopted an accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that requires entities to provide details of reclassifications
in the disclosure of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) balances. In addition, for significant items reclassified out of AOCI in the fiscal quarter, entities must provide information about the effects on net income
together, in one location, on the face of the statement where net income is presented, or as a separate disclosure in the notes. For items not reclassified to net income in their entirety in the fiscal quarter, entities must cross-reference to the
note where additional details about the effects of the reclassifications are disclosed. The adoption of this update did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective

In March 2013, the FASB
issued an accounting standards update that clarifies previous U.S. GAAP regarding the release of cumulative translation adjustment (“CTA”) into earnings in certain situations. When an entity ceases to have



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a consolidated foreign entity and the sale or transfer of such subsidiary or group of assets results in the complete or
substantially complete liquidation of such foreign entity, any related CTA should be reclassified from AOCI and included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale or transfer. Upon a sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of
an investment in a consolidated foreign entity that results in either (1) a loss of a controlling financial interest in the foreign entity or (2) an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which the acquirer held an equity interest
immediately before the acquisition date in a business combination achieved in stages, any related CTA should be reclassified from AOCI and included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale or liquidation. For a sale of part of an ownership
interest in a foreign investment that is accounted for as an equity method investment, a pro rata portion of CTA attributable to that investment should be reclassified from AOCI and included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale. This
standard is to be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, which for us is our fiscal 2015. The adoption of this standard will not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting
standards update that requires unrecognized tax benefits to be presented as a decrease in a net operating loss, similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met. This standard is to be applied prospectively and is effective
for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, which for us is our fiscal 2015. Retrospective application is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards
update that raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and allows companies to have significant continuing involvement and continuing cash flows with discontinued operations. This standard also requires additional
disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. This standard is to be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years,
and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014, which for us is our fiscal 2016. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in
financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all revenue recognition guidance
under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and supersedes some cost guidance for construction-type and production-type contracts. The guidance in this standard is principles-based, and accordingly, entities will be required to
use more judgment and make more estimates than under prior guidance, including identifying contract performance obligations, estimating variable consideration to include in the contract price and allocating the transaction price to separate
performance obligations. The guidance in this standard is applicable to all contracts with customers, regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. Additionally, this standard provides guidance for transactions that were not
previously addressed comprehensively (e.g., service revenue, contract modifications, and licenses of intellectual property) and modifies guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The core principle of this standard is that entities should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To help financial statement users
better understand the nature, amount, timing and potential uncertainty of the revenue that is recognized, this standard requires significantly more interim and annual disclosures. This standard allows for either “full retrospective”
adoption (application to all periods presented) or “modified retrospective” adoption (application to only the most current period presented in the financial statements, as well as certain additional required footnote disclosures). This
standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, which for us is our fiscal 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 3: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit our cyber integrated solutions
operation (“CIS”), which provided remote cloud hosting, and to dispose of the related assets, and we reported CIS as discontinued operations beginning with our financial results presented in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third
quarter of fiscal 2012. On August 27, 2013, we completed the sale of the remaining assets of CIS for $35 million, including $28 million in cash and a $7 million subordinated promissory note. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, our Board of
Directors approved a plan to divest our broadcast communications operation (“Broadcast Communications”),



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

which provided digital media management solutions in support of broadcast customers, and we reported Broadcast Communications as discontinued operations beginning with our financial results
presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2012. On February 4, 2013, we completed the sale of Broadcast Communications to an affiliate of The Gores Group, LLC pursuant to a definitive Asset Sale Agreement entered into
December 5, 2012 for $225 million, including $160 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments (including a post-closing working capital adjustment, which is currently in litigation), a $15 million subordinated promissory note (which was
collected in fiscal 2014) and an earnout of up to $50 million based on future performance. Should the litigation related to the post-closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price be resolved unfavorably to us, we believe such an outcome
would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Both CIS and Broadcast Communications were formerly part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment.

Discontinued operations in fiscal 2014 consisted of an $18.0 million ($6.9 million after-tax) increase in the loss on sale of Broadcast
Communications from miscellaneous adjustments for contingencies related to the disposition, and a $3.1 million ($1.9 million after-tax) gain on sale of the remaining assets of CIS. In fiscal 2014, the $9.9 million discontinued operations tax benefit
included a $4.8 million tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily related to the realization of additional tax deductions in respect of Broadcast Communications on various fiscal 2013 tax returns compared with our recorded
estimates at the end of fiscal 2013. Discontinued operations in fiscal 2013 included a loss of $32.7 million ($32.2 million after-tax) on the sale of Broadcast Communications in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as non-cash impairment
charges totaling $314.4 million ($297.3 million after-tax) recorded during the first two quarters of fiscal 2013 related to Broadcast Communications based on indicators of value, including financial performance, market conditions, indications of
value from interested parties and our entering into a definitive Asset Sale Agreement relating to the sale of Broadcast Communications. Additionally, based on market indications during fiscal 2013, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling
$16.5 million ($10.1 million after-tax) to write down assets of CIS to their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Summarized financial information for our discontinued operations related to CIS and Broadcast Communications is as follows:

NOTE 4:  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

NOTE 8:  GOODWILL

Goodwill is not amortized. We perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our
goodwill.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2014
and June 28, 2013, by business segment, were as follows:

The balances shown for our Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications Systems segments
reflect that we reassigned $2.4 million of goodwill (determined on a relative fair value basis) to our Integrated Network Solutions segment from our Government Communications Systems segment in connection with our transition at the beginning of the
first quarter of fiscal 2014 in managing our cyber security network testing operation as part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment rather than our Government Communications Systems segment, as described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
Policies

.

NOTE 9:  INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

Intangible
assets are summarized below:

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges totaling $16.7 million in our
Integrated Network Solutions segment related to intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of Carefx in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily resulting from a shift in strategy away from Carefx’s legacy products. The
$16.7 million of impairment charges were comprised of $5.4 million, $4.8 million, $5.4 million and $1.1 million for intangible assets related to customer relationships, developed technologies, contract backlog and trade names, respectively.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded a $12.3 million impairment charge in our Integrated Network Solutions segment related to an IT services contract vehicle (included in the “Other” intangible asset category in
the table above), primarily based on impacts of sequestration and a new rule incorporated into the contract vehicle limiting bid opportunities for large businesses.

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $59.3 million, $74.5 million and $78.6 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Future estimated amortization expense for intangible assets is as follows:

NOTE 10:  ACCRUED WARRANTIES

Changes in our liability for standard product warranties, which is included as a component of the “Other accrued items” and
“Other long-term liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, during fiscal 2014 and 2013, were as follows:

We also sell extended product warranties and recognize revenue from these arrangements over the warranty
period. Costs of warranty services under these arrangements are recognized as incurred. Deferred revenue associated with extended product warranties at June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013 was $38.9 million and $34.6 million, respectively, and
is included within the “Advance payments and unearned income” and “Other long-term liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 11:  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

2012 Credit
Agreement:

On September 28, 2012, we established a new $1 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2012 Credit Facility”) by entering into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the
“2012 Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders that replaced our prior credit facilities.

The 2012 Credit
Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of credit, at any time and from time to time during the term of the 2012 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not to exceed $1 billion for both revolving loans and letters of credit, with a sub-limit of $70 million for swingline loans and a sub-limit of $175 million for letters of credit. The 2012 Credit Agreement
includes a provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount of commitments under the 2012 Credit Agreement by an amount not to exceed $500 million. Only consenting
lenders (including new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent) will participate in any such increase. In no event will the maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2012 Credit Agreement exceed $1.5 billion. The
proceeds of loans or letters of credit borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement are restricted from being used for hostile acquisitions (as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement) or for any purpose in contravention of applicable laws. We are not
otherwise restricted under the 2012 Credit Agreement from using the proceeds of loans or letters of credit borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement for working capital and other general corporate purposes or from using the 2012 Credit Facility to
support commercial paper issued by us from time to time. Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a non-U.S.
currency sub-limit of $200 million. The 2012 Credit Agreement provides that we may designate certain wholly owned subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2012 Credit Agreement, and the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be guaranteed
by Harris Corporation. The



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2012 Credit Agreement also provides that we may designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain of the representations and covenants in the 2012 Credit Agreement
do not apply in respect of such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement denominated in U.S.
Dollars will bear interest either at (i) the eurocurrency rate for the applicable interest period plus an applicable margin, or (ii) the base rate plus an applicable margin. The eurocurrency rate for an interest period is the rate per
annum equal to (a) the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for such interest period, divided by (b) a percentage equal to 1.00 minus the daily average eurocurrency reserve rate for such interest period. The applicable
interest rate margin over the eurocurrency rate is initially equal to 1.125%, but may increase (to a maximum amount of 1.500%) or decrease (to a minimum amount of 0.875%) based on changes in the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt
securities (“Senior Debt Ratings”). The base rate is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars, or
(iii) the eurrocurrency rate determined on a daily basis for a one-month interest period plus 100 basis points. The applicable interest rate margin over the base rate is initially equal to 0.125%, but may increase (to a maximum amount of
0.500%) or decrease (to a minimum amount of 0.000%) based on changes in our Senior Debt Ratings. Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear interest at the eurocurrency rate for the
applicable interest period plus an applicable margin, as described above, plus, in some cases, mandatory costs. Letter of credit fees are also determined based on our Senior Debt Ratings.

In addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the 2012 Credit Agreement and
letter of credit fees, we are required to pay a quarterly unused commitment fee, which accrues at an applicable rate per annum multiplied by the actual daily amount of the lenders’ aggregate unused commitments under the 2012 Credit Agreement.
The applicable rate per annum for the unused commitment fee is initially equal to 0.125%, but may increase (to a maximum amount of 0.200%) or decrease (to a minimum amount of 0.080%) based on changes in our Senior Debt Ratings.

The 2012 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and certain customary covenants, including covenants limiting:
certain liens on assets; certain mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and certain investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; and a covenant requiring that we not
permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 at any time. We were in compliance with the covenants in the 2012 Credit Agreement at June 27,
2014. The 2012 Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including: failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms, covenants or agreements; material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty; payment default under other
indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of $100 million or acceleration of or ability to accelerate such other indebtedness; occurrence of one or more final judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of $100 million that
remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability in excess of $100 million; any bankruptcy or insolvency; invalidity of 2012 Credit Agreement documentation; or a change of control (as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, including if
a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock). If an event of default occurs, then the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings to be
immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees. All principal amounts borrowed or outstanding under the 2012 Credit Agreement are due on September 28, 2017, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at our
request or if certain events of default occur. At June 27, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the 2012 Credit Agreement, but we had $30 million of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper program that was supported
by the 2012 Credit Facility.

Other:

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf
registration statement, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2013, related to the potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, fractional interests in preferred
stock represented by depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

NOTE 12:  SHORT-TERM DEBT

Our short-term debt at June 27, 2014 and June 28, 2013 was $58.3 million and $144.6 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate for our short-term debt was 2.8 percent at
June 27, 2014 and 0.8 percent at June 28, 2013.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 13:  LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt is summarized below:

The potential maturities of long-term debt, including the current portion, for the five years following
fiscal 2014 and, in total, thereafter are: $1.4 million in fiscal 2015; none in fiscal 2016; none in fiscal 2017; $400.0 million in fiscal 2018; $350.0 million in fiscal 2019; and $825.8 million thereafter. All of our outstanding long-term
debt is unsubordinated and unsecured with equal ranking.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
$400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to the
date of repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the notes, we entered into treasury lock agreements to protect against fluctuations in forecasted interest payments resulting from the issuance of 10-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in the
benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. These agreements were determined to be highly effective in offsetting changes in forecasted interest payments as a result of changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these agreements on
December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of $5.5 million, net of income tax, in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This loss, along with $5.0 million in debt issuance costs, is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method, and is reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Notes due June 15,
2019. Interest on the notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The “make-whole”
redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than interest accruing to the
date of redemption) on the notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis points. In each case, we
will pay accrued interest on the principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase the
notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and discounts
related to the issuance of the notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
Statement of Income.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On December 3, 2010, we completed the issuance of $400 million in aggregate
principal amount of 4.4% Notes due December 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.15% Notes due December 15, 2040 (the “2040 Notes”). Interest on each of the 2020 Notes and the
2040 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may redeem the 2020 Notes and/or the 2040 Notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part at the applicable “make-whole”
redemption price. The applicable “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the principal
and interest (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, as
defined, plus 25 basis points in the case of the 2020 Notes and 35 basis points in the case of the 2040 Notes. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption date. In addition, upon a
change of control combined with a below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest on
the notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. We incurred $5.5 million and $4.8 million in debt issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the 2020 Notes and 2040 Notes, respectively, which are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the respective lives of the notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Debentures due January 15,
2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior to maturity.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million in
aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
$99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the option of the holders of the debentures. We may redeem the remaining $25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the
debentures in whole, or in part, at any time at a pre-determined redemption price.

NOTE 14:  STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of June 27, 2014, we had two shareholder-approved employee stock incentive plans
(“SIPs”), including the Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective August 27, 2010) (“Restated EIP”), under which options or other share-based compensation was outstanding, and we have
granted the following types of share-based awards under these SIPs: stock options, performance share awards, performance share unit awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards. We believe that such awards more closely align the
interests of employees with those of shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our SIPs).

Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense

The following table summarizes
the amounts and classification of share-based compensation expense:

Compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements that was capitalized as part of
inventory or fixed assets in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was not material.

Shares of common stock remaining available for
future issuance under our SIPs totaled 10,474,951 as of June 27, 2014. In fiscal 2014, we issued an aggregate of 3,144,685 shares of common stock under the terms of our SIPs, which is net of shares withheld for tax purposes.

The following information relates to stock options that have been granted under shareholder-approved SIPs. Option exercise prices are equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock on
the date the options are granted, using the closing stock price of our common stock. Options may be exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally ranges from seven to ten years after the date of grant, and they generally become
exercisable in installments, which are typically 33.3 percent one year from the grant date, 33.3 percent two years from the grant date and 33.3 percent three years from the grant date.

The fair value as of the grant date of each option award was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which uses
assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on our common stock and the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options. The expected term of the
options is based on historical observations of our common stock over the past ten years, considering average years to exercise for all options exercised, average years to cancellation for all options cancelled and average years remaining for
outstanding options, which is calculated based on the weighted-average vesting period plus the weighted-average of the difference between the vesting period and average years to exercise and cancellation. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

A
summary of the significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock option grants under our SIPs is as follows:

A summary of stock option activity under our SIPs as of June 27, 2014 and changes during fiscal 2014
is as follows:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value was $12.40 per share, $10.32 per share and $9.44 per share for
options granted during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $51.0 million, $28.9 million and $16.2 million, respectively, at the time of
exercise.

A summary of the status of our nonvested stock options at June 27, 2014 and changes during fiscal 2014 is as
follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As of June 27, 2014, there was $27.2 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under our SIPs. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.54 years. The total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal 2014, 2013 and
2012 was approximately $16.1 million, $22.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Unit Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units that have
been granted to employees under our Restated EIP. The restricted stock and restricted stock units are not transferable until vested and the restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified time period.

The fair value as of the grant date of each restricted stock or restricted stock unit award is based on the closing price of our common
stock on the date of grant and is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At June 27, 2014, there were 3,750 shares of restricted stock and 685,106 restricted stock units outstanding, all of which were payable in shares.

A summary of the status of our restricted stock and restricted stock units at June 27, 2014 and changes during fiscal
2014 is as follows:

As of June 27, 2014, there was $16.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards under our Restated EIP. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.27 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share of restricted stock and per unit of
restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $61.39, $46.54 and $37.67, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately
$12.3 million, $11.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively.

Performance Share and Performance Share Unit Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance shares and performance share units that have been granted
to employees under our Restated EIP. Generally, performance share and performance share unit awards are subject to performance criteria such as meeting predetermined operating income and return on invested capital targets (and market conditions,
such as total shareholder return, for such awards granted beginning in fiscal 2011) for a 3-year performance period. These awards also generally vest at the expiration of the same 3-year period. The final determination of the number of shares to be
issued in respect of an award is made by our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of Directors.

The fair value as of
the grant date of each performance share or performance share unit award was determined based on a fair value from a multifactor Monte Carlo valuation model that simulates our stock price and total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to
other companies in our TSR peer group, less a discount to reflect the delay in payments of cash dividend-equivalents that are made only upon vesting. The fair value of each performance share or performance share unit award is amortized to
compensation expense over the vesting period if achievement of the performance measures is considered probable. At June 27, 2014, there were no performance shares outstanding, and there were 811,323 performance share units outstanding, all of
which were payable in shares.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A summary of the status of our performance shares and performance share units at
June 27, 2014 and changes during fiscal 2014 is as follows:

As of June 27, 2014, there was $17.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
performance share and performance share unit awards under our Restated EIP. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.24 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share of performance shares and per unit
of performance share units granted during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $59.17, $45.92 and $37.56, respectively. The total fair value of performance shares and performance share units that vested during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately
$3.5 million, $17.9 million and $17.2 million, respectively.

NOTE 15:  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER SHARE

The computations of income from continuing operations per share are as follows (in this

Note 15

, “income
from continuing operations” refers to income from continuing operations attributable to Harris Corporation common shareholders):

Potential dilutive common shares primarily consist of employee stock options and performance share and
performance share unit awards. Employee stock options to purchase approximately 651,904, 3,164,450 and 5,151,746 shares of our common stock were outstanding at the end of fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, but were not included as dilutive
stock options in the computations of income from continuing operations per diluted common share because the effect would have been antidilutive.

NOTE 16:  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs were $264.1 million, $254.1
million and $218.9 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in the “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income. These costs in fiscal 2013 included a
$17.8 million write-off of capitalized software in our Integrated Network Solutions segment as a result of a change in accounting estimate. Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements,
principally U.S. Government-sponsored contracts requiring us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance or other specifications (such as designs), and are accounted for principally by the cost-to-cost
percentage-of-completion method. Customer-sponsored research and development is included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 17:  INTEREST EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $93.6 million, $109.1 million and $113.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. Interest paid was $92.6 million, $109.9 million and $109.6 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

NOTE 18:  LEASE COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to $48.3 million, $48.2 million and $47.9 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under leases with an initial lease term in excess of one year, primarily for land and buildings, amounted to approximately $221.0 million at June 27, 2014. These commitments for the five
years following fiscal 2014 and, in total, thereafter are: fiscal 2015 — $45.4 million; fiscal 2016 — $37.8 million; fiscal 2017 — $31.6 million; fiscal 2018 — $21.1 million; fiscal
2019 — $16.7 million; and $68.4 million thereafter. These commitments do not contain any material rent escalations, rent holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions, leasehold improvement incentives or unusual provisions or
conditions. We do not consider any of these individual leases material to our operations. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term are amortized over the current lease term, or estimated life, if
shorter.

NOTE 19:  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks and formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking hedge transactions. We recognize all derivatives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.

At June 27, 2014, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $155.7 million, of which $119.6 million were classified as fair value hedges and
$36.1 million were classified as cash flow hedges. This compares with open foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $58.5 million at June 28, 2013, of which $47.7 million were classified as fair value hedges
and $10.8 million were classified as cash flow hedges. At June 27, 2014, contract expiration dates ranged from less than 1 month to 12 months, with a weighted average contract life of 2 months.

Balance Sheet Hedges

To
manage the exposure in our balance sheet to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we implement fair value hedges. More specifically, we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge certain balance sheet items,
including foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and inventory. Changes in the value of the derivatives and the related hedged items are reflected in earnings, in the “Cost of product sales” line item in our Consolidated
Statement of Income. As of June 27, 2014, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts denominated in the British Pound, Norwegian Krone, Singapore Dollar, Mexican Peso, Euro and Australian Dollar to hedge certain balance sheet items.
The net gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts designated as fair value hedges were not material in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. In addition, no amounts were recognized in earnings in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012 related to hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges

To manage our exposure to currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with anticipated cash flows that are probable of occurring
in the future, we implement cash flow hedges. More specifically, we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments, including purchase commitments to suppliers, future committed
sales to customers and intersegment transactions. These derivatives are being used to hedge currency exposures from cash flows anticipated across our business segments. We also have hedged U.S. Dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
anticipated profit margins in our international operations. As of June 27, 2014, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts denominated in the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar to hedge certain
forecasted transactions.

These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase and have a high degree of
correlation to the anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the anticipated cash flows from the hedging instruments and the anticipated cash flows from the future foreign currency
commitments through the maturity dates of the derivatives used to hedge these cash flows. These financial instruments are marked-to-market using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

hedge ineffectiveness. Gains and losses from other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the related hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. The cash flow impact of our derivatives is included in the same category in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related hedged items.

The net gains or losses from cash flow hedges recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income, including
gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness, were not material in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. We do not expect the net gains or losses recognized in the “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of June 27, 2014 that will be reclassified to earnings from other comprehensive income within the next 12 months to be material.

Credit Risk

We are
exposed to the risk of credit losses from non-performance by counterparties to the financial instruments discussed above, but we do not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, we select
counterparties based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to any single counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market position with each counterparty.

See

Note 22: Fair Value Measurements

for the amount of the assets and liabilities related to the foreign currency forward contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27, 2014,
and see our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for additional information on changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three fiscal years ended June 27, 2014.

NOTE 20:  NON-OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)

The components of non-operating income (loss) were as follows:

(1)

The loss in fiscal 2013 reflected a charge associated with our optional redemption on May 28, 2013 of the entire outstanding $300 million principal amount of our
5% Notes due October 1, 2015.

NOTE 21:  INCOME TAXES

The provisions for current and deferred income taxes are summarized as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The total income tax provision is summarized as follows:

The components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:

A reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate follows:

State and local income taxes allocable to certain U.S. Government contracts are included in our operating
expenses and, therefore, are not included in our provision for income taxes. We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes on $266.6 million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest those
earnings indefinitely. Determination of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and credit carryforwards as of June 27, 2014 have expiration dates
ranging between one year and no expiration in certain instances. The amount of Federal, international, and state and local tax loss carryforwards as of June 27, 2014 were $29.2 million, $89.5 million and $7.6 million,
respectively. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes of international subsidiaries was $59.2 million, $3.9 million and $15.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Income taxes paid were $194.1 million,
$212.9 million and $205.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The valuation allowance decreased $5.9 million from $74.1 million at the end of fiscal 2013 to $68.2 million at the end of fiscal 2014. The valuation
allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the future.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as
follows:

As of June 27, 2014, we had $71.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which
$58.3 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized. As of June 28, 2013, we had $73.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $43.3 million would
favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized.

We recognize accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. We had accrued $12.8 million for the potential payment of interest and penalties as of June 27, 2014 (and this amount was not included in the
$71.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits balance at June 27, 2014 shown above) and $10.7 million of this total could favorably impact future tax rates. We had accrued $11.3 million for the potential payment of interest and
penalties as of June 28, 2013 (and this amount was not included in the $73.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits balance at June 28, 2013 shown above) and $9.0 million of this total could favorably impact future tax rates.

We file numerous separate and consolidated income tax returns reporting our financial results and, where appropriate, those of
our subsidiaries and affiliates, in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Compliance Assurance Process, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining fiscal 2010, fiscal
2011, fiscal 2012, fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. We are currently under examination by the Canadian Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2007 through 2010, and we are appealing portions of a Canadian assessment relating to fiscal years 2000
through 2006. We are currently under examination or contesting proposed adjustments by various state and international tax authorities for fiscal years ranging from 1997 through 2012. It is reasonably possible that there could be a significant
decrease or increase to our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the course of the next twelve months as these examinations continue, other tax examinations commence or various statutes of limitations expire. An estimate of the range of possible
changes cannot be made because of the significant number of jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax periods.

NOTE 22:  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal market (or most advantageous market, in the absence of a principal market) for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Entities are required to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and to utilize a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as
follows:

Ÿ

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Ÿ

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable
market data by correlation or other means.

Ÿ

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities, and reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed using the best information available in the circumstances.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy of our assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) as of June 27, 2014:

(1)

Represents investments held in a Rabbi Trust associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which we include in the “Other current assets” and
“Other non-current assets” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2)

Represents investments related to our defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom, which we include in the “Other non-current assets” line item in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(3)

Includes derivatives designated as hedging instruments, which we include in the “Other current assets” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair
value of these contracts was measured using a market approach based on quoted foreign currency forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturities.

(4)

Primarily represents obligations to pay benefits under certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which we include in the “Compensation and benefits”
and “Other long-term liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under these plans, participants designate investment options (including money market, stock and fixed-income funds), which serve as the basis for measurement
of the notional value of their accounts.

(5)

Includes derivatives designated as hedging instruments, which we include in the “Other accrued items” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair
value of these contracts was measured using a market approach based on quoted foreign currency forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturities.

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our significant financial instruments that were not measured at fair value (carrying amounts of other financial instruments
not listed in the table below approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those items):

(1)

The fair value was estimated using a market approach based on quoted market prices for our debt traded in the secondary market. If our long-term debt in our balance
sheet were measured at fair value, it would be categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 23:  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We structure our operations primarily around the products and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report
the financial results of our operations in the following three reportable operating or business segments — RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications Systems. Our RF Communications segment is a global supplier
of secure tactical radio communications and high-grade encryption solutions for military, government and commercial customers and also of secure communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility and transportation customers. Our
Integrated Network Solutions segment provides government, energy, maritime and healthcare customers with integrated communications and IT and services, including mission-critical end-to-end IT services, managed satellite and terrestrial
communications solutions and standards-based healthcare interoperability solutions. Our Government Communications Systems segment conducts advanced research and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

develops, produces, integrates and supports advanced communications and information systems that solve the mission-critical challenges of our civilian, intelligence and defense government
customers worldwide, primarily the U.S. Government. Each business segment is comprised of multiple program areas and product and service lines that aggregate into such business segment.

See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for information regarding discontinued operations. Except for disclosures related to our
cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes relate solely to our continuing operations.

As discussed in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

, at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, to leverage the breadth of our IT enterprise network and information assurance
capabilities for the IT Services market, we began managing our cyber security network testing operation as part of our Integrated Network Solutions segment rather than our Government Communications Systems segment. The historical results, discussion
and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this change to our business segment reporting structure for all periods presented in this Report.

The accounting policies of our business segments are the same as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.
We evaluate each segment’s performance based on its operating income or loss, which we define as profit or loss from operations before income taxes excluding interest income and expense, royalties and related intellectual property expenses,
equity method investment income or loss and gains or losses from securities and other investments. Intersegment sales are generally transferred at cost to the buying segment and the sourcing segment recognizes a profit that is eliminated. The
“Corporate eliminations” line items in the tables below represent the elimination of intersegment sales and their related profits. The “Unallocated corporate expense” line item in the tables below represents the portion of
corporate expenses not allocated to our business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
States with international revenue derived primarily from exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Sales made to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales
funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, by all segments as a percentage of total revenue were 67 percent, 67 percent and 70 percent in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue
from services in fiscal 2014 was approximately 8 percent, 97 percent and 18 percent of total revenue in our RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications Systems segments, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Selected information by business segment and geographical area is summarized below:

Corporate assets consisted primarily of cash, income taxes receivable, deferred income taxes, deferred
compensation plan investments, buildings and equipment. Depreciation and amortization included intangible assets, capitalized software and debt issuance costs amortization of $62.2 million, $77.8 million and $82.2 million in fiscal
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Export revenue was $1.06 billion, $892.1 million and $955.8 million in
fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Fiscal 2014 export revenue and revenue from international operations was principally from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Canada. Fiscal 2014 long-lived assets from international
operations were principally in the United Kingdom, which had $30.3 million of long-lived assets as of June 27, 2014.

Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes

(1)

“Non-operating income (loss)” includes equity method investment income (loss); income (expense) related to intellectual property matters; gains and losses on
sales of investments, securities available-for-sale and prepayment of long-term debt; and impairments of investments and securities available-for-sale. Additional information regarding non-operating income (loss) is set forth in

Note 20:
Non-Operating Income (Loss)

.

(2)

Income from continuing operations before income taxes included a $126.7 million charge, net of government cost reimbursement, for Company-wide restructuring and
other actions, including prepayment of long-term debt, asset impairments, a write-off of capitalized software, facility consolidation, workforce reductions and other associated costs. This resulted in charges of $9.2 million,
$52.5 million, $10.5 million and $21.3 million in our RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions and Government Communications Systems segments and at our corporate headquarters, respectively, and $33.2 million (related to
prepayment of long-term debt) in “Non-operating income (loss).”

(3)

The operating income in our Integrated Network Solutions segment included a $58.2 million charge for integration and other costs associated with our acquisitions
of CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc., Schlumberger group’s Global Connectivity Services business and Carefx.

NOTE 24:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are, and were, engaged,
various claims or charges are asserted and litigation or arbitration is commenced by or against us arising from or related to matters, including but not limited to: product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other
intellectual property; labor and employee disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; strategic acquisitions or divestitures; the prior sale or use of former products allegedly containing asbestos or other restricted materials; breach of warranty;
or environmental matters. Claimed amounts against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We record accruals for losses related to
those matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and legal costs generally are expensed when incurred. At June 27, 2014, our accrual
for the potential resolution of lawsuits, claims or proceedings that we consider probable of being decided unfavorably to us is not material. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, it is reasonably
possible that some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us and in excess of the amounts currently accrued. Based on available information, in the opinion of management, settlements, arbitration awards and
final judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at June 27, 2014 are reserved against or would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct
business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or ultimately through established legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any ultimate amounts that are
likely to result from these audits; however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding audits and examinations by taxing authorities of our tax
filings is set forth in

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives,
and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2014, we carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this work and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2014 our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in Internal Control:

We periodically review our
internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial
reporting to identify potential changes to our processes and systems that may improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing
new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of business units, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving segregation of duties and increasing monitoring controls.
In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired business as part of our integration activities. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the quarter ended June 27, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of fiscal 2014 and concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of fiscal 2014. “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” of this Report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Their unqualified report is included within
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Report.

Under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in addition to options, we have granted share-based compensation awards in the form of performance shares, restricted stock,
performance share units, restricted stock units or other similar types of share awards. As of June 27, 2014, there were 1,500,179 such awards outstanding under that plan, consisting of (i) 3,750 restricted stock awards, for which all
3,750 shares were issued and outstanding; and (ii) 1,496,429 performance share unit awards and restricted stock unit awards, for which all 1,496,429 were payable in shares but for which no shares were yet issued and outstanding. The
5,370,073 shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights as listed in column (a) consisted of shares to be issued in respect of the exercise of 3,873,644 outstanding options and in respect of the 1,496,429
performance share unit awards and restricted stock unit awards payable in shares. Because there is no exercise price associated with restricted stock awards, performance share unit awards or restricted stock unit awards, all of which are granted to
