designs, develops and produces state-of-the-art airborne,
spaceborne and terrestrial communications and information
processing equipment and systems for the U.S. Department of
Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and other
U.S. Government agencies and also for other large aerospace
and defense companies serving the U.S. Government marketplace.
This segment also develops and produces information processing
and communications systems to collect, store, retrieve, process,
analyze, display and distribute information for the U.S.
Government, its agencies and its prime contractors. The
Government Communications Systems segment specializes in
aerospace communications, avionics and ground communications;

and communications; and communications engineering and technical
services. This segment’s state-of-the-art technologies,
products, systems and services include:

Aerospace Communications Systems:

Ground Communications Systems:

•

tactical/mobile satellite terminals for
    communications at C-, X-, Ku-, Ka- and Q-1 bands, as well
    as multiband systems,



Information, Technical Services and
Communications Systems:

The Government Communications Systems segment is
a supplier of advanced-technology communications and information
processing systems to the U.S. Department of Defense (including
Air Force, Army and Navy customers), Federal Aviation
Administration, NASA, National Imaging and Mapping Agency, U.S.
Census Bureau, other Federal and local government agencies and
aircraft manufacturers and prime contractors. In fiscal 2003,
approximately 38 percent of the revenues for this segment
were under contracts with prime contractors and approximately 62
percent were direct with the customer.

The Government Communications Systems segment is
a leading supplier of air-traffic control communication systems
and is also a major supplier of custom aircraft and spaceborne
communication and information processing systems; cockpit
digital moving maps, controls and display processors; a leading
supplier of terrestrial and satellite communication systems,
including large deployable satellite antenna systems and flat
panel, phased-array and single-mission antennas; and a
preeminent supplier of super-high-frequency military satellite
ground terminals for the U.S. Department of Defense.

This segment is a major supplier of custom
ground-based systems and software designed to collect, store,
retrieve, process, analyze, display and distribute information
for government, defense and law enforcement applications,
including meteorological data processing systems and range
management information systems. This segment also provides
computer-controlled electronic maintenance, logistic, simulation
and test systems for military aircraft, ships and ground
vehicles, and provides sophisticated ground-based and shipboard
command, control, communication, computer and intelligence
systems, products and services for many government end-users.
This segment’s electronic products enable high-speed
communications for platforms such as the USAF F/A-22 Raptor
air-dominance fighter, the F/ A-18 Super Hornet and the
Army’s RAH-66 Comanche advanced armed reconnaissance
helicopter. The segment is also supplying portions of the
communications systems for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
program (formerly known as National Missile Defense) and has won
follow-on awards for the U.S. Army’s Multiple Launch Rocket
System program.

Specific examples of technology developed by this
segment include a family of wideband digital links to support
the transmission of radar, imagery and video from reconnaissance
aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites and the
development of a digital map that electronically displays
real-time terrain, flight paths and target locations for fighter
helicopters. The segment also has extensive expertise in
microelectronics, microelectronic machines and advanced wireless
tracking technology and is developing secure wireless LAN
products for battlefield applications and advanced modems for
use in high-bandwidth efficient systems.



Major program milestones for the segment in
fiscal 2003 included:

•

an award of a six-year, $70 million contract
    by TRW Inc. for development of the In-Flight Interceptor
    Communications System for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
    (“GMD”) program.



A significant portion of this segment’s
business involves classified programs. While classified programs
are not discussed in this Annual Report, the operating results
relating to classified programs are included in our consolidated
financial statements and the business risks associated with such
programs do not differ materially from those of other programs
for the U.S. Government. Under many of our programs, we are
required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances
complying with U.S. Department of Defense and other Federal
agency requirements.

Revenue in fiscal 2003 for this business segment
increased 23.0 percent to $1,137.4 million from
$924.4 million in fiscal 2002. Segment operating income
increased 22.7 percent to $104.9 million. This segment
contributed 54 percent of our total revenues in fiscal
2003, 49 percent in fiscal 2002 and 43 percent in
fiscal 2001.

Most of the sales of the Government
Communications Systems segment are made directly or indirectly
to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
containing standard government contract clauses providing for
redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
at the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default of the
contractor. Some of our Government Communications Systems
segment’s significant programs by revenue in fiscal 2003
included LMST, FTI, MCOM, GMD, JSF, F/A-22, and several
classified programs. Our largest program represented less than
five percent of the segment’s revenues for fiscal
2003. Our 10 largest programs by revenue in fiscal 2003
represented less than 30 percent of the segment’s
revenues in fiscal 2003. This segment currently has a diverse
portfolio of approximately 250 programs, each having a value
over $1 million. In fiscal 2003, U.S. Government customers,
whether directly or through prime contractors, accounted for
approximately 94 percent of the segment’s total revenues.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this
segment of our business was $389 million at July 25,
2003, compared with $426 million a year earlier.

The segment’s contracts include both
cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement
contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus
the payment of a fee. These contracts fall into three basic
types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for
the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of
performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which
provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified
limits, based upon actual results compared to contractual
targets relating to such factors as cost, performance and
delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts,
which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
contractor against pre-established criteria. Under
cost-reimbursement type contracts, we are reimbursed
periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the
fee based on contract progress.

Our fixed-price contracts are either firm
fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope
of work for a fixed price and as a result, benefit from cost
savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under fixed-price
incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government savings
accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs and
costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling
price (which is higher than the target cost) and carry the
entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, our profit may also
be adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified
performance objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and
fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually receive either
milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract
price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government in
amounts equaling 75 percent of costs incurred under U.S.
Government contracts. The remaining amounts, including profits
or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance
of end items and deliverables under the contract.

Cost-reimbursement contracts generally have lower
profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Production contracts
are mainly fixed-price contracts and development contracts are
generally cost-reimbursement contracts. For fiscal 2003,
62 percent of the revenues of this segment were generated
from cost-reimbursement contracts and 38 percent from
fixed-price contracts.

For a discussion of certain risks affecting our
government business, see “Principal Customers,”
“Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

RF Communications

Our RF Communications segment is a leading
supplier of secure wireless voice and data communications
products, systems and networks to the U.S. Department of Defense
and other Federal and state agencies and to foreign government
defense agencies, of which a significant portion is sold through
the U.S. Government’s foreign military sales program, as
well as through system integrators. This segment supplies a
comprehensive line



of secure radio products and systems for
man-portable, mobile, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
applications. This segment develops and sells radio systems that
are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting the
diverse mission requirements of our modern military.

Major products and services offered by our RF
Communications segment include:

The segment’s Falcon® II family of HF,
VHF and UHF radios share common operation, logistics and
accessories and are built on a software-defined radio platform
which is reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades.
Software-defined radio technology offers significantly increased
flexibility in supporting a variety of wireless communications
protocols without the need to change hardware. The Falcon®
II family covers the frequency range of 1.6 to 512 MHz. These
radios also have military-strength embedded encryption and can
be linked to computers, providing network capabilities on the
battlefield.

The segment’s Sierra™II cryptographic
subsystem is a miniaturized programmable module that can be
integrated into radios and other voice and data communications
devices to encrypt classified information prior to transmission
and storage. The segment’s encryption modules currently

include:

Harris is a leader in the development of the
next-generation tactical radio programs. During the third
quarter of fiscal 2003, the RF Communications segment was
awarded a $10 million contract for cryptographic software
development in support of the U.S. Department of Defense Joint
Tactical Radio System program, and in the fourth quarter Harris
was selected to incorporate the Sierra™-based Cryptographic
Subsystems into all radios to be manufactured under the first
cluster of the Joint Tactical Radio System program. Under the
Joint Tactical Radio System program, the U.S. Department of
Defense is seeking to develop a family of software programmable
radios that share a common digital architecture that can be
applied to multiple platforms and support multiple radio
waveforms. The segment won a key position on the Joint Tactical
Radio System program during fiscal 2002. We were selected as
part of a team to provide system design, development and
production work for the first “cluster” of a
five-cluster development program that will provide advanced
radio communications for all U.S. military forces. The
anticipated revenue from this program could be as much as
$500 million through full production over 15 years.

In fiscal 2003, the segment shipped the first
low-rate initial-production units for the U.K. Ministry of
Defence’s Bowman Radio Programme and also shipped the first
of its radio systems for the Bowman Radio Programme manufactured
at the Harris operation located in Basingstoke, United Kingdom.
In fiscal 2002 the segment signed a contract, now valued at
approximately $220 million, to supply the high-frequency
subsystems for the Bowman Radio Programme. Under the terms of
this contract with General Dynamics United Kingdom Limited, we
expect to provide upwards of 10,000 radio units over the course
of the five-year program.



The War on Terrorism, as well as Homeland Defense
operations, continue to drive positive results for the segment.
In fiscal 2003, the business responded to urgent requirements
for its industry-leading Falcon® II radios from a broad
base of government customers, including the U.S. Special
Operations Command, the U.S. Army Communications –
Electronics Command and the U.K. Ministry of Defence. The
segment’s radios are also becoming the standard of NATO and
Partnership for Peace countries. Sales in fiscal 2003 were made
to Romania, Macedonia, Uzbekistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Oman,
Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Chile and Estonia.
Contracts also included a $10 million order from the Defense
Early Response Fund, which provides funding for the U.S.
National Guard and other agencies that provide quick response in
times of national emergencies.

Revenues in fiscal 2003 for the RF Communications
segment increased 26.1 percent over fiscal 2002 to
$325.7 million. Segment operating income was $84.3 million
in fiscal 2003 compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2002.
The RF Communications segment contributed 16 percent of our
total revenues in fiscal 2003, 14 percent in fiscal 2002
and 12 percent in fiscal 2001. Approximately
52 percent of the sales of this segment were made outside
of the United States in fiscal 2003. A significant portion of
these sales were made to NATO and Partnership for Peace forces.

In general, the segment’s domestic products
are sold and serviced directly to customers through its sales
organizations and through established distribution channels.
Internationally, the segment markets and sells its products and
services through regional sales offices and established
distribution channels, including through the U.S.
Government’s Foreign Military Sales program. See

products and services include domestic and international
television and radio broadcasters. Major products, systems and
services offered by our Broadcast Communications segment include:

This segment has provided digital television
transmitters to many U.S. broadcasters as they comply with the
U.S. Government-mandated transition from analog to digital
transmission. In connection with the transition of broadcasting
from analog to digital technologies and the trend toward
centralized operations, broadcasters have more opportunities to
expand channel and service offerings and for automation of many
processes. Following the acquisition of Louth Automation in
fiscal 2000, we have become a leading supplier of automation
solutions for broadcasters. Our automation product offerings
include master control-play-out systems for single- and
multi-channel applications, wide-area automation solutions,
media asset management systems, program management services and
related support and training.

Our Broadcast Communications segment is North
America’s largest supplier of radio and television
broadcast equipment. Approximately 35 percent of the
revenues of the segment were made outside of the United States
in fiscal 2003.

Revenues in fiscal 2003 for the Broadcast
Communications segment decreased 11.2 percent from fiscal
2002 to $315.2 million. Segment operating income was
$8.0 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $37.2 million
in fiscal 2002. The Broadcast Communications segment contributed
15 percent of our total revenues in fiscal 2003,
19 percent in fiscal 2002 and 17 percent in fiscal
2001.

In general, the segment’s domestic products
are sold and serviced directly to customers through its sales
organizations and through established distribution channels.
Internationally, the segment markets and sells its products and
services through regional sales offices and established
distribution channels. See “International Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment
of our business was $93 million at July 25, 2003,
substantially all of which is expected to be filled during the
2004 fiscal year, compared with $88 million a year earlier.

International Business

Revenues in fiscal 2003 from products exported
from the United States (including foreign military sales) or
manufactured abroad were $427.4 million or 20 percent
of our total revenues, compared with $416.7 million or
22 percent of our total revenues in fiscal 2002 and
$572.8 million or 29 percent of our total revenues in
fiscal 2001. Our international sales include both direct exports
from the United States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Most
of the international sales are derived from the Microwave
Communications, RF Communications and Broadcast Communications
segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S.
dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally
denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Exports
from the United States, principally to Europe and Asia, totaled
$227.3 million or 53 percent



of our international sales in fiscal 2003,
$185.1 million or 44 percent of our international
sales in fiscal 2002 and $227.1 million or 40 percent
of our international sales in fiscal 2001.

Foreign operations represented 10 percent of
revenues in fiscal 2003, 12 percent of revenues in fiscal 2002
and 18 percent in fiscal 2001; and 15 percent of long-lived
assets as of June 27, 2003 and 12 percent of
long-lived assets as of June 28, 2002. Government
Communication Systems segment systems are produced principally
in the United States. International revenues are derived
primarily from exports.

Principal international manufacturing facilities
are located in Canada, China and the United Kingdom.
International marketing activities are conducted through
subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
America and Asia. We have also established international
marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
Registrant” for further information regarding our foreign
subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including
dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the
marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both
domestically and internationally. These independent
representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit
orders from commercial or governmental customers for direct
sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances
may be recommended or established by the independent
representative and may be on a basis which is above or below our
list prices. These independent representatives generally receive
a discount from our list prices and may mark-up those prices in
setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. During the
2003 fiscal year, revenues from indirect sales channels
represented 8 percent of our total revenues and 35 percent
of our international revenues compared to revenues from indirect
sales channels in fiscal year 2002 representing 8 percent
of our total revenues and 34 percent of our international
revenues.

Fiscal year 2003 revenues came from a large
number of foreign countries, no one of which accounted for
5 percent or more of our total revenues. Certain of our
exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance
carried either on an open account or installment note basis.
Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments
received prior to or upon shipment often cover most of the
related costs incurred. Performance guarantees by us are
generally required on significant foreign government contracts.
In order to stay competitive in international markets, we also
enter into recourse and vendor financing to facilitate sales to
certain customers.

The particular economic, social and political
conditions for business conducted outside the United States
differ from those encountered by domestic businesses. Our
management believes that the overall business risk for the
international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that
faced by its domestic operations as a whole. A description of
the types of risks to which we are subject in international
business is contained in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
offset by the diversification of the international business and
the protection provided by letters of credit and advance
payments.

Financial information regarding our domestic and
international operations is contained in

Note 23: Business
Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive businesses that
are sensitive to technological advances. Although successful
product and systems development is not necessarily dependent on
substantial financial resources, some of our competitors in each
of our businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher
levels of expenditures for research and development.

In the Microwave Communications segment our
existing and potential competitors include: Alcatel Networks,
Inc., Stratex Networks, Inc., Ericsson, Inc., NEC and Nera
Telecommunications, Inc. as well as other companies which are in
the development stage. Several of our competitors are original
equipment manufacturers through which we distribute and sell
products and services to end-users.

In the Broadcast Communications segment our
existing and potential competitors include: Broadcast
Electronics, Inc., Encoda Systems, Inc., Rhode & Schwarz
GmbH, Tandberg Television ASA, Thales Broadcast &
Multimedia, as well as other private companies and divisions of
large companies.

In the Network Support segment our existing and
potential competitors include: TTI Telecom International, Inc.,
Turnstone Systems, Inc., Spirent PLC, Teradyne, Inc., Tollgrade
Communications, Inc., Textron, Inc., Fluke (a subsidiary of
Danaher Corporation) and Sunrise Telecom, Inc. as well as
numerous other small and larger companies.



In the RF Communications segment our existing and
potential competitors include: Thales Communications, Inc.,
General Dynamics Corporation, ITT Aerospace and Communications
Division and Raytheon Company as well as numerous other small
and larger companies.

Our competition in the Government Communications
Systems segment, including for U.S. Government contracts,
typically is large, technically competent firms with substantial
assets. The on-going consolidation of the U.S. and global
defense, space and aerospace and related industries continues to
intensify competition. Consolidation among U.S. defense and
aerospace companies has resulted in a reduction in the number of
principal prime contractors. As a result of this consolidation,
we frequently “partner” with the major prime
contractors such as The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin
Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and Northrop Grumman
Corporation, some of which are, from time to time, competitors
on other programs.

We concentrate in each of our businesses on the
market opportunities which our management believes are
compatible with our resources, overall technological
capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in
these businesses are cost-effectiveness, product quality and
reliability, technological capabilities, service, ability to
meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of dealers in
international areas.

Principal Customers

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only
customer accounting for 10 percent or more of total revenues,
were 62 percent, 54 percent and 42 percent of our
total revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
to, the U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as
for default. Under contracts terminable at the convenience of
the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
Contracts which are terminable for default generally provide
that the U.S. Government only pays for the work it has accepted
and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.

Companies engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government are dependent on congressional
appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be
affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from
various military and political developments. In many cases,
there is also additional uncertainty relating to the complexity
of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental
and highly sophisticated technical work. For further discussion
of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Legal
Proceedings” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Backlog

Our funded backlog of unfilled orders was
approximately:

•

$912 million at July 25, 2003,

•

$888 million at July 26, 2002, and

•

$775 million at July 27, 2001.

The determination of backlog involves substantial
estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements
contracts and long-term contracts of a cost-reimbursement or
incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as the value of contract
awards received from the U.S. Government for which the U.S.
Government has appropriated funds and the appropriating agency
has given us authorization to spend these funds under the
contract, plus the amount of contract awards and orders received
from customers other than the U.S. Government which have
yet to be recognized as revenues. We expect to fill
approximately 90 percent of our current backlog in fiscal
2004. However, there can be no assurance that our funded backlog
will become sales in any particular period, if at all. Our
funded backlog does not include the full amount of our contract
awards, including those pertaining to multi-year,
cost-reimbursable contracts, which are generally funded on an
annual basis. Funded backlog also excludes the sales amount of
unexercised contract options that may be exercised by customers
under existing contracts and the sales amount of purchase orders
that may be issued under indefinite quantity contracts or basic
ordering agreements.



Research, Development and
Engineering

Research, development and engineering
expenditures by us totaled approximately:

•

$600 million in fiscal 2003,

•

$516 million in fiscal 2002, and

•

$486 million in fiscal 2001.

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs, which included research and development for
commercial products and independent research and development
related to government products and services, were approximately:

•

$100 million in fiscal 2003,

•

$104 million in fiscal 2002, and

•

$114 million in fiscal 2001.

The portion of total research, development and
engineering expenditures not company-sponsored was funded by
government and commercial customers. Company-funded research is
directed to the development of new products and to building
technological capability in selected communications and
electronic systems areas. U.S. Government-funded research
helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Almost
all of our segments maintain their own engineering and new
product development departments, with scientific assistance
provided by advanced-technology departments. We currently employ
about 5,000 engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts
to make the technologies developed in any of our business
segments available for all other business segments.

Patents and Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual
property rights, in the aggregate, to constitute an important
asset. We own a large and valuable portfolio of intellectual
property; we also license intellectual property to and from
third parties. As of June 27, 2003, we held approximately
712 U.S. patents and 244 foreign patents, and had approximately
345 U.S. patent applications pending and 798 foreign patent
applications pending. However, we do not consider our business
or any business segment to be materially dependent upon any
single patent, license or other intellectual property rights, or
any group of related patents or other intellectual property
rights. We are engaged in a pro-active patent licensing program,
and have entered into a number of unilateral license and
cross-license agreements, many of which generate royalty income.
Although existing license agreements have generated income in
past years and will do so in the future, there can be no
assurances we will enter into additional income-producing
license agreements. With regard to patents relating to our
Government Communications Systems segment, the U.S. Government
often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize
others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant
to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our
use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.
Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products
are considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental and Other Regulations

Our manufacturing facilities, in common with
those of industry in general, are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly
with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe that we have
materially complied with these requirements and that such
compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business
or financial condition. Expenditures to protect the environment
and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations
over the next several years are not expected to have a material
impact on our competitive or financial position. If future laws
and regulations contain more stringent requirements than
presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than
our present estimates of those expenditures.

We have installed waste treatment facilities and
pollution control equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to
achieve our waste minimization and prevention goals. We did not
spend any material amounts on environmental capital projects in
fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001. A portion of our environmental
expenditures relate to discontinued operations for which we have
retained certain environmental liabilities. We currently expect
that amounts to be spent for environmental-related capital
projects will not be material in fiscal 2004. These amounts



may increase in future years. Additional
information regarding environmental matters is set forth in
“Legal Proceedings” and in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

Radio communications are subject to governmental
regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments, in particular, is subject
to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference
among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit
interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to
our existing products. Reallocation of frequency spectrum also
could impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and
services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our
facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw
materials needed for our operations and for our products. We are
dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
of components and the ability of our suppliers and
subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications
and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
of a particular item or because of domestic preference
requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. To
date, while we have been impacted by financial and performance
issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not
been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain
raw materials or products.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered
to be seasonal, although in recent years our revenues in the
second half of our fiscal year have generally exceeded revenues
in the first half. Various factors can affect the distribution
of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing
of U.S. Government awards, the availability of funding,
product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

As of June 27, 2003, we had approximately
10,200 employees, of whom approximately 9,200 were located in
the United States. Approximately 1,200 employees were employed
in the RF Communications segment, 1,100 in the Microwave
Communications segment, 200 in the Network Support segment,
1,100 in the Broadcast Communications segment and 6,200 in the
Government Communications Systems segment, with the remainder
employed in headquarters or other support or service functions.
None of our employees in the United States are represented by a
labor union; however, in certain international subsidiaries, our
employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory
labor unions. In general, we believe that our relations with our
employees are good.

Additional Information

Additional information relating to our
businesses, including our operating segments, is set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”



ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

We operate approximately 83 office and
manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
5.4 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
warehousing, engineering and office space of which about
4.2 million square feet are owned and about
1.2 million square feet are leased. The leased facilities
are for the most part occupied under leases for terms ranging
from one month to 10 years, a majority of which can be
terminated or renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at
our option. As of June 27, 2003, the locations of each
segment’s principal office and manufacturing facilities in
productive use were as follows:

In the opinion of management, our facilities,
whether owned or leased, are suitable and adequate for their
intended purposes and have capacities adequate for current and
projected needs. While we do have some unused or under-utilized
facilities, they are not considered significant. For more
information about our lease obligations, see

Note 19: Lease
Commitments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.



ITEM 3.  LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time
to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of
businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
related to: product liability; patents, trademarks or trade
secrets; labor and employee disputes; the sale or use of
products containing asbestos; breach of warranty; antitrust;
distribution; or contractual relations. Claimed amounts may be
substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the
merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court
awards. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
matters with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings
may be disposed or decided unfavorably to us, based upon
available information, in the opinion of management, settlements
and final judgments, if any, which might be rendered against us
in existing litigation are reserved against, covered by
insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or our business taken as a whole.

U.S. Government
Business.

U.S. Government
contractors, such as us, engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government and its various agencies are dependent on
congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
policies. U.S. Government contracts typically involve long lead
times for design and development, are subject to significant
changes in contract scheduling and may be unilaterally modified
or cancelled by the U.S. Government. Often these contracts
call for successful design and production of complex and
technologically advanced products or systems. We may participate
in supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government as either
a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor.
Disputes may arise between the prime contractor and the
U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
contracting parties.

As a defense contractor, our contract costs are
audited and reviewed on a continual basis by the Defense
Contract Audit Agency. In addition to these routine audits, from
time to time, we may, either individually or in conjunction with
other U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits and
investigations by other agencies of the U.S. Government. These
audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our
performance and administering of our U.S. Government
contracts are compliant with applicable contractual
requirements, procurement and other applicable Federal statutes
and regulations. These investigations may be conducted without
our knowledge. We are unable to predict the outcome of such
investigations or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or
other actions that could be instituted against us, our officers
or employees. Under present U.S. Government procurement
regulations, if indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement
or other Federal civil laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or
more of our operating divisions, could be subject to fines,
penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages. U.S.
Government regulations also provide that certain findings
against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from
eligibility for awards of new U.S. Government contracts for
up to three years. In addition, a U.S. Government
contractor’s foreign export privileges could be suspended
or revoked. Suspension or debarment could have a material
adverse effect on us because of our reliance on
U.S. Government contracts.

International.

As an
international company, we are, from time to time, the subject of
investigations relating to our international operations,
including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
laws. We are currently cooperating with certain
U.S. Government representatives in investigations relating
to potential violations of foreign corrupt practices and other
laws. Our management does not believe that the outcome of these
current disputes or investigations will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or our business taken as a
whole.

Environmental.

We
are subject to numerous Federal and state environmental laws and
regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time in
investigations or litigation of various potential environmental
issues concerning activities at our facilities, former
facilities or remediation as a result of past activities. From
time to time we receive notices from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent state
environmental agencies that we are a potentially responsible
party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
“Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent state legislation.
Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup costs at
various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites we
previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by
us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us
from past operations. We have been named as a potentially
responsible party at 14 such sites, excluding sites as to which
our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability
has been finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict
the outcome of many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our
management, any payments we may be required to make as a result
of currently existing claims will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or our business taken as a
whole.



In April 2002, 43 plaintiffs filed suit
against 23 defendants, including us, in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the
“Schwinger” matter). The complaint seeks redress for
injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of defendants
allegedly emitting toxins into the environment located in and
near Hicksville, New York. Five related defendants are
classified as “Verizon” defendants and are alleged to
have released radioactive and toxic materials. The remaining
defendants, including us, have been accused of releasing
non-radioactive materials. The plaintiffs claimed damages that
exceeded $360 million. In September 2002, we received
an amended complaint, which added approximately 141 plaintiffs,
bringing the number of plaintiffs to 184. The claim for damages
in the amended complaint appeared to double from the original
complaint. In December 2002, the judge presiding over the
Schwinger matter administratively dismissed the action and
required the plaintiffs to refile their claims through three
nominative plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs will be required to show
how we and the other named defendants caused their losses before
the remaining plaintiffs are allowed to proceed. We have been
served with that refiled complaint which includes claims for
compensatory and punitive damages. We also were served with a
related complaint by a single plaintiff (the “Astuto”
matter) who alleges losses similar to the three plaintiffs in
the Schwinger matter but makes no monetary demand. The plaintiff
in the Astuto matter will be required to show how we and the
other named defendants caused certain losses before eight other
plaintiffs are able to join in that action. We also have been
served with a complaint in a third related matter (the
“Bennet” matter), where 44 plaintiffs are alleging
claims similar to those brought by the Schwinger and Astuto
plaintiffs against a similar group of defendants, including us.
The Bennet plaintiffs are claiming $135 million in damages.
Proceedings in the Bennet matter have been stayed pending the
outcome of the Schwinger and Astuto matters. We believe that our
liability in these related matters, if any, is not significant.
We anticipate filing appropriate motions in each case and intend
to vigorously defend each action.

Additional information regarding environmental
matters is set forth in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Other Matters.

We
previously filed a patent infringement claim against Ericsson,
Inc. in the United States Federal District Court for the
Northern District of Texas. On October 29, 2002, a jury
rendered a verdict in our favor against Ericsson, Inc. and its
parent company. The jury awarded us approximately
$61 million in compensatory damages and found that
Ericsson’s conduct was “willful.” Following the
rendering of such verdict, we filed a motion to treble the
damages and Ericsson filed motions (i) to decrease the
damage award, (ii) to order a new trial, and (iii) for
non-infringement and invalidity of the patent notwithstanding
the jury’s verdict. On July 17, 2003, the Court issued
a ruling on these motions denying Ericsson’s motions for
non-infringement and invalidity of the patent, but did rule that
unless we agreed to a lowered damage award of $43 million
in compensatory damages within 30 days, it was granting
Ericsson’s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages.
Harris has agreed to the lowered damages and thus, a judgment
was entered for Harris in the amount of $43 million plus
$1 million for enhanced damages and $1 million for
attorneys’ fees, as well as pre-judgment interest, which we
currently estimate to be approximately $8 million. The
judgment is subject to appeal.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS
TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted by us to a vote of our
security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT (As of
August 28, 2003).

Our executive officers are as follows:



There is no family relationship between any of
our executive officers or directors, and there are no
arrangements or understandings between any of our executive
officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any
of them was elected as an officer or director, other than
arrangements or understandings with our directors or officers
acting solely in their capacities as such. All of our executive
officers are elected annually and serve at the pleasure of our
board of directors.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY
    AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

Market Information

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS,” and
also is traded on the Boston, Chicago, Pacific and Philadelphia
Stock Exchanges and through the Intermarket Trading System.
According to the records of our transfer agent, as of
August 22, 2003, there were approximately 8,425 holders of
record of our common stock.

The high and low sales prices as reported in the
consolidated transaction reporting system and the dividends paid
on our common stock for each quarterly period in the last two
fiscal years are reported below:

On August 22, 2003, the last sale price of
our common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction
reporting system was $32.55 per share.

Dividends

On August 23, 2003, our board declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, which will be
paid on September 19, 2003 to holders of record on
September 5, 2003. We have paid cash dividends every year
since 1941 and currently expect that cash dividends will
continue to be paid in the near future; however, there can be no
assurances that this will be the case. On August 23, 2003
our board increased our annual dividend rate from $0.32 per
share to its current $0.40 per share. This increase follows
the increase of our annual dividend rate from $0.20 per share to
$0.32 per share in August of 2002. The declaration of dividends
and the amount thereof will depend on a number of factors,
including our financial condition, capital requirements, results
of operations, future business prospects and other factors that
our board of directors may deem relevant.

Repurchases

On October 22, 1999, our board authorized us
to repurchase up to 15 million shares of our common stock
periodically in the open market, in negotiated or block
transactions or pursuant to tender offers. During fiscal 2003,
we repurchased 217,500 of our shares in open-market
transactions, at an average price per share of $27.36. We did
not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2002. We
have a remaining authorization to purchase an additional
1.5 million shares under our currently authorized
repurchase program.

Sale of Securities

On August 26, 2002, we completed a private
placement offering of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and
Wachovia Securities, Inc. acted as the initial purchasers of the
debentures. The debentures were offered and sold to the initial
purchasers in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with this offering and
sale, we paid the initial purchasers a commission equal to
2.5 percent of the principal amount of the debentures.

The debentures initially bear interest at an
annual rate of 3.5 percent per year, which will be reset on
August 15, 2007, August 15, 2012, and August 15, 2017,
to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable



120 days prior to such reset date on 5-year
U.S. Treasury Notes. In no event, however, will the interest
rate be reset below 3.5 percent or above 5.5 percent
per year.

Holders of the debentures will have the right to
convert each of their debentures into shares of our common stock
prior to the stated maturity under any of the following
circumstances:

(i)

during any calendar quarter if the closing sale
    price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the
    30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day
    of the previous calendar quarter, is more than 110 percent
    of the applicable conversion price per share of our common stock
    on such last trading day,

(ii)

debentures called for redemption may be

Business Considerations

Government and Defense
Industry:

Few developments have had as
profound an effect on the defense and security environment of
the United States as the events of September 11, 2001. In
response to that tragedy, the United States has committed itself
to the War on Terrorism including actions taken in Afghanistan
and the War in Iraq. Homeland security has become central to
this strategy. Markets for defense and advanced technology
systems were, during fiscal 2003 and in the foreseeable future
will continue to be, impacted by the worldwide War on Terrorism
and threats created by widespread availability of weapons of
mass destruction. At the same time, the United States and its
allies have undertaken to transform military capabilities from
defending against threats posed by the former Soviet Union to
focus upon regional conflicts and proactive threat
identification. Such endeavors may require unilateral or
coordinated activities ranging from surveillance to engagement,
policing or peacekeeping. As a result of these trends and
technology developments, the United States and its allies are
placing more reliance on (i) sophisticated weapon systems that
provide long-range surveillance and intelligence,
(ii) battlefield management and precision strike expertise,
and (iii) the ability to quickly and efficiently deploy
complete defensive platforms globally. The U.S. Department
of Defense continues to emphasize the need for advanced
technology and electronics to meet the new and emerging threats,
to protect the homeland against terrorism and missile attack, to
use information and communications as a distinct battle area
advantage and to protect power globally by using intelligence
and long-range weaponry.

The budget for the U.S. Department of
Defense for fiscal 2003 and beyond reflects the above-mentioned
transformation of national defense policy and response to
increased needs for homeland security and defeating terrorism.
Budget increases are projected for operational readiness and
personnel needs, as well as for procurement and for research and
development. Although the ultimate size of future defense
budgets remains uncertain, current indications suggest the
defense budget will continue to increase over the next several
years. Our management believes our experience and capabilities
are well aligned with the United States’ defense priorities
and initiatives which may increase the demand for our
capabilities in areas such as imaging, intelligence and
surveillance, secure communications and information technology
systems.

While these developments have had a positive
impact on our Government Communications Systems and
RF Communications segments, we remain subject to other
risks associated with U.S. Government business, including
technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations
and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks,
which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Telecommunications Equipment
Industry:

The telecommunications
equipment industry has experienced a very challenging period in
which business activity has changed substantially. Service
providers have experienced significantly reduced revenue growth,
significantly reduced access to capital and the need to manage
cash flow and focus on profitability. In response to these
challenges, service providers have reduced capital expenditures.
As a result, our Microwave Communications and Network Support
segments currently remain subject to the general economic
slowdown and limited access to capital as well as the other
risks associated with these businesses, which are discussed
elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Prior to this slowdown, the telecommunications
equipment industry was experiencing significant growth driven by
the demand for Internet broadband access from businesses and
individuals, mobile cellular communications, the build-out of
telecommunications infrastructures in developing regions, the
evolution of private communications networks and the
availability of capital. Our management believes the
availability of capital will improve and the demand for wireless
telecommunications equipment and network support products
eventually will rebound.



Broadcast Industry:

The worldwide over-the-air broadcast equipment industry is
currently transitioning from analog to digital broadcasting. At
the same time, the broadcast industry has been affected by
delays in capital spending by the broadcasters due to the weak
economy.

The digital transition is occurring most rapidly
for television broadcasting in the United States, where the
conversion to digital has been mandated by Congress and is under
the management of the Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”). The new digital television technology
provides higher-quality TV pictures, a significant increase in
the amount of TV programming that can be delivered to consumers
and the opportunity for the broadcasters to provide an array of
new services. In addition, moving to the new system will make
broadcast spectrum available to be auctioned by the FCC for new
commercial uses.

The FCC recently proposed new deadlines that
would require stations in larger markets to comply with near
full-power transmission requirements by July 2005. All other
markets would be required to comply one year later. When
enacted, the deadlines would help bring more certainty to the
timing of increased demand for digital TV equipment. Previously,
to encourage a larger number of broadcasters to commence digital
television broadcasting, the FCC initially allowed broadcasters
to go on the air with a lower-power signal.

Currently, more than 1,300 of the nation’s
1,688 commercial and public broadcasters have ordered equipment
that would allow them to meet at least the minimum, first-step
requirements of the FCC’s mandated digital television
rollout schedule. Nearly 98 percent of U.S. households now
have access to at least one digital TV signal and approximately
6.2 million high-definition receivers have been sold in the
U.S. On August 8, 2002, the FCC adopted a plan that
requires digital television tuners in nearly all new television
sets by 2007. By enacting a five-year rollout schedule that
starts with larger, more expensive TV sets, the FCC believes
that costs for equipment manufacturers and consumers will be
minimized. These actions mark additional steps in the progress
toward making the completion of the digital television
transition a reality.

Domestic radio broadcasters also have taken the
first steps in transitioning from analog to digital technology.
There are approximately 12,000 radio stations in the United
States and the timing of the domestic digital radio conversion
will be market driven.

Internationally, the transition to digital
technologies, for both radio and television, is in various
stages of implementation. In general, digital television and
radio adoption has been slow across global markets, as there are
very few mandated conversions in the international arena.
Consequently, many international markets remain primarily analog
replacement markets.

The industry trend in both television and radio
toward consolidation and multiple-location operations is
continuing and should drive increased future demand for
automation, studio systems, network management and services to
manage the consolidated facilities. Similarly,
broadcasters’ desire to find new nontraditional revenue
streams, such as datacasting, should also drive increased
spending on equipment and services.

Our management believes that our experience and
capabilities are well aligned with, and that we are poised to
take advantage of, the industry trends noted above. While we
believe that these developments generally will have a positive
impact on our Broadcast Communications segment, we remain
subject to general economic conditions which adversely impact
the broadcasters. We also remain subject to other risks
associated with the broadcast industry, including technological
uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s rollout of digital
television, slow market adoption of digital radio and other
risks which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal

Our revenue from product sales and services for
fiscal 2003 was $2,092.7 million, an increase of
11.6 percent compared to fiscal 2002. Increased revenues in
our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
segments were partially offset by decreased revenues in our
Broadcast Communications, Network Support and Microwave
Communications segments. Net income for fiscal 2003 was
$59.5 million, or $.90 per diluted share, compared to
$82.6 million, or $1.25 per diluted share in fiscal 2002.

The decrease in net income was due to decreased
operating income in our Broadcast Communications segment when
compared to fiscal 2002, higher segment operating losses in our
Microwave Communications and Network Support segments when
compared to these segments’ operating losses in fiscal
2002, lower non-operating income when compared to fiscal 2002
and increased net interest expense and headquarters expense when
compared to fiscal 2002. These decreases to net income were
partially offset by increased fiscal 2003



segment operating income in our
RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
segments when compared to fiscal 2002.

Net income was impacted in fiscal 2003 by
$30.8 million of after-tax charges associated with
reductions in labor, facility shutdowns, discontinuation of
low-margin telecom products and disposal of assets remaining
from the previously exited telecom switch business as well as a
$12.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of our minority
interest in our LiveTV, LLC venture. Net income was impacted in
fiscal 2002 by $10.4 million of after-tax charges
associated with reductions in labor, facility shutdowns and
collection losses related to the bankruptcy of a customer in
Latin America as well as a $6.8 million after-tax gain from
the sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy
Controls Systems, LLC joint venture.

Comparative Statement of
Income

Our comparative statement of income is:

Gross Margin:

Our
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 24.7 percent in
fiscal 2003 compared to 26.5 percent in fiscal 2002. Fiscal
2003 gross margin was impacted by $17.6 million of
inventory write-offs associated with the exit of our Microwave
Communications segment’s WinRoLL and RapidNet wireless
local loop products ($5.8 million), our Microwave
Communications segment’s MDL microwave radio products
($1.3 million), our Network Support segment’s access
test and management products ($9.0 million) and the
shut-down of our Microwave Communications segment’s
manufacturing plant in Brazil ($1.5 million). The lower gross
margin also resulted from our Broadcast Communications segment,
which had lower volume and a shift in product mix away from
higher-margin digital television equipment to lower-margin
analog products. To a lesser extent, our Microwave
Communications segment’s gross margin also was impacted by
weak international markets and supply chain issues including the
bankruptcy of a major supplier in France and other disruptions
that increased our costs to deliver systems on time to our
customers. These gross margin decreases were partially offset by
improved gross margin from higher revenue and manufacturing
efficiencies in our RF Communications segment. Gross margin in
our Government Communications Systems segment was slightly lower
than the prior year due to favorable contract closeouts
experienced in fiscal 2002.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative
Expenses:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased from $400.2 million in
fiscal 2002 to $431.9 million in fiscal 2003. As a
percentage of revenue, it decreased from 21.3 percent of
revenue in fiscal 2002 to 20.6 percent of revenue in fiscal
2003.

Fiscal 2003 engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were impacted by $29.1 million of
expenses associated with cost reduction actions aimed at
reducing infrastructure costs in our corporate headquarters
($4.0 million) and Broadcast Communications segment
($4.4 million), cost reduction actions in our Microwave
Communications segment including the consolidation of its
research and development activities in the U.S. from three
locations to one location in Durham, North Carolina and the
reduction of infrastructure costs in some of its international
locations ($8.3 million) as well as write-downs related to
the disposal of assets remaining from our previously exited
telephone switch business ($12.4 million). The
$29.1 million of charges included



severance, relocation and facility shut-down
costs of $9.0 million, $5.6 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, as well as the $12.4 million write-down of
assets mentioned above. Fiscal 2002 engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were impacted by $15.8 million of
costs associated with the cost-cutting actions primarily related
to the shut-down of the Microwave Communications segment’s
Calgary, Canada facility and cost reductions at its
Chatenay-Malabry, France location ($8.8 million) and
collection losses related to the bankruptcy of a customer in
Latin America ($7.0 million). The $15.8 million of
charges included severance, relocation and facility shut-down
costs of $7.1 million, $0.6 million and
$1.1 million, respectively, as well as the
$7.0 million of collection losses mentioned above.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our Government Communications Systems segment due
to increased volume and bid opportunities and in our RF
Communications segment due to increased volume and new product
development primarily related to the Joint Tactical Radio System
program opportunities. Headquarters expense, which is included
in engineering, selling and administration expenses, also
increased in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 mostly due
to a $4.2 million contribution to our retiring Chairman of
the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer’s
supplemental executive retirement plan account. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses in our Network Support,
Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications segments
also were impacted by on-going cost reduction actions at these
segments.

Overall company-sponsored research and product
development costs, which are included in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses, were $99.6 million in fiscal 2003
versus $103.9 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease was
primarily due to a relatively high level of spending on the
development of our broadband wireless access products in fiscal
2002. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending
by our RF Communications segment for the development of
Joint Tactical Radio System-related products.

Customer-sponsored research and development,
which does not impact engineering, selling and administrative
expenses, increased from $412.3 million in fiscal 2002 to
$499.9 million in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of the
U.S. Government continuing significant new spending for the War
on Terrorism.

Non-Operating
Income:

Our non-operating income
decreased from $41.0 million in fiscal 2002 to
$23.7 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in non-operating
income is primarily due to a $42.3 million reduction in
gains from the sale of securities related to technology
investments available-for-sale from $64.2 million in fiscal
2002 to $21.9 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in
non-operating income also was due to a $10.3 million gain
from the sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy
Controls Systems, LLC joint venture in fiscal 2002. These
reductions were partially offset by an $18.8 million gain
from the sale of our minority interest in our LiveTV, LLC
venture in fiscal 2003. We also experienced a $10.0 million
write-down of our investment interest in Terion, Inc. in fiscal
2002 related to an impairment to this investment that was other
than temporary. The gains from the sale of securities
available-for-sale in both years resulted primarily from the
sale of shares in Intersil Corporation, which were acquired in
August 1999 in connection with the sale of our
semiconductor operations. There was no equity income or loss
from investments in fiscal 2003 compared to equity income of
$7.3 million in fiscal 2002. In September 2002, we
sold our remaining investment that we accounted for under the
equity method of accounting, which was our minority interest in
LiveTV, LLC. Expenses and fees associated with marketing and
technology projects, our selected investments and other items
reduced non-operating income by $13.5 million in fiscal
2003 and $22.8 million in fiscal 2002.

Interest Income and Interest
Expense:

Our interest income decreased
from $13.3 million in fiscal 2002 to $6.1 million in
fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 benefited from interest received from
the overpayment of income taxes. Our interest expense decreased
from $26.7 million in fiscal 2002 to $24.9 million in
fiscal 2003, primarily due to the repayment of
$98.6 million of our 6.65 percent debentures in the first
quarter of fiscal 2002, the retirement of our $30.5 million
6.38 percent notes payable to banks in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003 and a $6.9 million reduction during fiscal 2003
in high interest rate notes with Brazilian banks. These actions
were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to
the private placement of $150 million of our
3.5 percent convertible debentures in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was
34.0 percent in both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. In both
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the impact of export sales reduced
our total tax rate below the statutory rate, including state
income taxes. Fiscal 2002 also benefited from the favorable
resolution of certain outstanding state tax liabilities, for
which we had previously provided. Fiscal 2003 also benefited
from research and development tax credits. The mix of foreign
tax rates and sources of foreign income and losses increased our
tax rates in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.



Return on Revenue:

Our net income as a percentage of revenue decreased from
4.4 percent in fiscal 2002 to 2.8 percent in fiscal
2003. The decrease was primarily due to the reasons previously
discussed.

Selected financial information relating to
geographical regions and export sales is set forth in

Discussion of Business
Segments

Government
Communications Systems Segment

Government Communications Systems segment revenue
increased 23.0 percent and segment operating income
increased 22.7 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003.
Growth in our Government Communications Systems segment revenues
was all organic and resulted from a broad spectrum of defense
and other U.S. Government agencies’ continued
investment in new integrated and assured network communications
systems that had a positive impact across all areas of this
segment. Our strong performance and technological capabilities
in communications, imaging and systems integration have
positioned this segment to take full advantage of the robust
U.S. Government procurement climate. Gross margins as a
percentage of revenue in our Government Communications Systems
segment were slightly lower than the prior year due to favorable
contract closeouts experienced in fiscal 2002. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses increased in our Government
Communications Systems segment due to increased volume and bid
opportunities but were lower as a percentage of revenue.

Approximately 40 percent of the
$213.0 million increase in revenue from fiscal 2002 to
fiscal 2003 came from classified programs, and approximately 30
percent of the increase was attributed to three programs that
were awarded in the last 18 months: the Mission
Communications Operations and Maintenance program for the Air
Force satellite network; the Joint Strike Fighter program, which
provides next-generation avionics infrastructure, image
processing, digital map software and fiber optic components to
the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corporation; and a program
to integrate and modernize the FAA Telecommunications
Infrastructure, which is comprised of approximately 5,000 FAA
sites.

Other recently won programs that are beginning to
produce increased revenue include the MAF/TIGER program for the
U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Air Force’s Family of Beyond
Line of Sight Terminals program, the U.S. Air Force and National
Reconnaissance Office’s Space-Based Radar program and the
National Imagery Mapping Agency’s Global Geospatial
Intelligence program.

RF
Communications Segment

RF Communications segment revenue increased
26.1 percent and segment operating income increased
63.4 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. This
improvement is related in great part to the strong demand from
U.S. and foreign military customers for our radios due to the
ongoing focus on combating terrorism and supporting homeland
security. Mission-critical requirements on the networked
battlefield are well-served by our leading-edge Falcon® II
family of secure tactical radios.

Increases in segment operating income outpaced
revenue growth. Higher revenue and favorable product mix drove
gross margins higher as we met the increased demand for our
products without incurring significant additional fixed costs.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
this segment due to increased volume and new product development
for products related to the Joint Tactical Radio System



program. Engineering, selling and administrative
expenses as a percent of revenue, however, decreased due to the
increased volume.

The segment has a strong position on two
next-generation tactical radio programs. During the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, our RF Communications segment won a
contract with potential revenues of more than $220 million
over six years to supply high-frequency radios for the United
Kingdom’s Bowman Tactical Radio Programme, one of the most
important land-based military projects in recent U.K. history.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the segment met a major
milestone on the Bowman Tactical Radio Programme by shipping the
first production units of its high-performance, HF radio
systems, which are being manufactured at its operations in
Basingstoke, United Kingdom.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, this
segment also was selected to incorporate its recently developed
Sierra™-based Cryptographic Subsystem into 100 percent
of the radios to be ordered under the first “cluster”
of the five-cluster program that the U.S. Department of Defense
calls its “Radio of the Future” — the Joint
Tactical Radio System. We expect this selection to result in
approximately $100 million of revenue over the next ten
years and we expect to provide more than $500 million in
system design, development and production for the Joint Tactical
Radio System program as part of the Boeing team on Cluster 1.
Also, we now are positioned to become the encryption standard
for other Joint Tactical Radio System clusters. We expect to bid
on Joint Tactical Radio System Clusters 2-5, which could have a
total value of approximately $5 billion. The latest
schedule indicates awards for Cluster 5 and Cluster 3 in the
summer of calendar year 2004.

Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the RF
Communications segment received a $10 million order from
the U.S. Army Defense Early Response Fund (“DERF”),
which is the segment’s first significant order for Homeland
Defense. DERF provides funding that allows agencies such as the
National Guard to purchase new radio equipment.

Growth in this segment, in general, and the Joint
Tactical Radio System development in particular, created a need
to expand our facilities and we purchased during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 a building adjacent to one of our
existing facilities in Rochester, New York.

Microwave
Communications Segment

Microwave Communications segment revenue
decreased 2.5 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. The
segment’s operating loss increased from $17.4 million
in fiscal 2002 to $26.9 million in fiscal 2003.

The fiscal 2003 operating loss was impacted by
$16.9 million of inventory write-offs associated with the
exit of this segment’s WinRoLL and RapidNet wireless local
loop products ($5.8 million), the exit of this
segment’s MDL microwave radio products ($1.3 million),
the shut-down of this segment’s Brazilian manufacturing
plant ($1.5 million), as well as cost reductions actions
including the consolidation of its research and development
activities in the U.S. from three locations to one location in
Durham, North Carolina and the reduction of infrastructure costs
in some of its international locations ($8.3 million). The
fiscal 2002 operating loss was impacted by $15.8 million of
costs associated with the cost-cutting actions primarily related
to the shut-down of the Microwave Communications segment’s
Calgary, Canada facility and cost reductions at its
Chatenay-Malabry, France location ($8.8 million) and
collection losses related to the bankruptcy of a customer in
Latin America ($7.0 million).

Revenue is down and segment operating losses are
up in this segment primarily as a result of continued capital
spending constraints in the international telecom equipment
markets and from continuing competitive pressures among
international equipment vendors. The segment maintained its
leadership position in North America. Strong sales continued for
our Constellation™ 155 radios, which are designed
specifically for the high-performance requirements of North
American mobile service providers, utility networks and state
and local governments.

Gross margins decreased in this segment in fiscal
2003 compared to fiscal 2002, mainly due to weak international
markets noted above and supply chain issues including the
bankruptcy of a major supplier in



France and other disruptions that increased our
costs to deliver systems on time to our customers. Going
forward, we have solidified our supply chain by moving to more
reliable and lower-cost vendors and have redesigned our
international products to reduce product cost. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses in this segment were
relatively flat as increased provisions for collection losses
offset savings experienced from on-going cost reduction
activities. It is unclear to us when significant strengthening
in international market conditions for this segment will occur.
We, however, remain focused on reducing our product and overhead
costs and improving segment operating income.

The $8.3 million charge mentioned above
included severance, relocation and facility shutdown costs of
$2.6 million, $3.6 million and $2.1 million,
respectively. We estimate that these actions will result in
annual pretax cost savings of $7.5 million.

The severance costs resulted from the layoff of
137 employees from the following functions: engineering –
76; services – 29; management and administration – 26;
and sales and marketing – 6. Geographically, the
individuals were from our locations in: Bellevue, Washington
– 38; Redwood Shores, California – 25; Montreal,
Canada – 18; Sao Paulo, Brazil – 15; Torrance,
California – 12; Shenzhen, China – 12; Mexico City,
Mexico – 7; Calgary, Canada – 4; San
Antonio, Texas – 3; and Other – 3. All of these
individuals were notified of their employment status and the
terms of their severance benefit prior to December 27,
2002, and they all received severance benefits prior to
February 26, 2003.

The facility shut-down costs of $2.1 million
related to our vacating facilities in Sao Paulo, Brazil
($1.1 million); Bellevue, Washington ($0.8 million); and
Torrance, California ($0.2 million) and included the
write-off of assets such as leasehold improvements
($1.0 million); lease termination costs
($0.8 million); and forfeited export tax credits
($0.3 million). All of these facilities were vacated prior
to December 27, 2002.

Network Support
Segment

Network Support segment revenue decreased
13.1 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. The
segment’s operating loss of $10.3 million in fiscal
2002 increased to $15.5 million in fiscal 2003. The fiscal
2003 operating loss includes a $9.0 million inventory
write-off associated with the exit of this segment’s access
and test management products. Revenue and gross margin both
decreased in this segment as it continues to suffer from weak
international markets and lower spending by the Regional Bell
Operating Companies. Engineering, selling and administrative
expenses were lower in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002
in this segment due to the cumulative effect of its on-going
cost reduction programs.

During the fourth quarter, this segment received
from a major telecom service provider the first order, in the
amount of $5 million, for its newly developed EXP™
field technician test system. The EXP™ system is designed
to improve field technician productivity and performance by
reducing repeat visits required to diagnose and repair telecom
problems or initiate new services. Field trials of this new
solution are ongoing with additional telecom customers.

Broadcast
Communications Segment

Broadcast Communications segment revenue
decreased 11.2 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 and
segment operating income decreased from $37.2 million in fiscal
2002 to $8.0 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 operating
income includes $4.4 million of costs associated with
cost-cutting actions aimed at reducing infrastructure costs.
Most of the decrease in revenue came from a decline in digital
television equipment sales.



Analog television transmitter and studio systems
revenues also decreased. These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in analog radio transmitter sales that related in
large part to a $64 million order to provide products and
services for the radio broadcast infrastructure of S.N.
Radiocomunicatii S.A., Romania’s state-owned broadcast
organization. The continued delay in capital spending by
customers was the result of continued weak advertising revenue,
smaller-market broadcasters installing the minimum amount of
equipment necessary to temporarily comply with the FCC’s
digital conversion mandates and disruption costs associated with
the news coverage of the War in Iraq.

This segment had significantly lower gross
margins in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 due to the
lower volume and the shift in product mix away from higher
margin digital television equipment to lower margin analog radio
products. This segment’s engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were lower in fiscal 2003 when compared
to fiscal 2002, due to the lower volume and ongoing cost-cutting
actions. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a
percent of revenue, however, increased in fiscal 2003 when
compared to fiscal 2002, as cost-cutting measures did not keep
pace with the 11.2 percent reduction in revenue.

The FCC has recently proposed new deadlines that
would require stations in major markets to comply with
full-power digital television transmission requirements by July
2005. All other markets would comply one year later. These
proposed deadlines are bringing more certainty to the timing of
increased demand for our digital television equipment. Many
broadcasters now are budgeting transmission and studio system
upgrades to full digital capability. We also are taking steps to
improve the Broadcast Communications segment operating income at
the current revenue levels through ongoing focus on cost
controls.

The $4.4 million charge mentioned above
included severance and relocation costs of $2.4 million and
$2.0 million, respectively. We estimate that these actions
will result in annual pretax cost savings of $12.0 million.

The severance costs resulted from the layoff of
94 employees from the following functions:
engineering – 36;
manufacturing – 26; management and
administration – 20; and sales and
marketing – 12. Geographically, the individuals
were from our locations in: Littleton,
Massachusetts – 26; Rennes,
France – 23; Mason, Ohio – 16;
Quincy, Illinois – 12; Sunnyvale,
California – 7; Winnersh,
U.K. – 6; and

Other – 4. All of
these individuals were notified of their termination prior to
June 27, 2003, and all will receive severance benefits
prior to August 31, 2003.

Headquarters Expense

Headquarters expense increased 41.8 percent
from $49.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $69.6 million in
fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 headquarters expense includes severance
costs associated with cost-cutting actions aimed at reducing
infrastructure costs ($4.0 million) and write-downs related
to the disposal of assets remaining from our previously exited
telephone switch business ($12.4 million). The increase in
headquarters expense was also due to a $4.2 million
contribution to our retiring Chairman of the Board, President
and Chief Executive Officer’s supplemental executive
retirement plan account.

We estimate these cost-cutting actions mentioned
above will result in annual pretax cost savings of
$13.0 million. Since much of the gross expenses incurred at
our corporate headquarters are billed to our operating segments,
a large portion of these cost savings will be recognized in the
operating income of our commercial segments rather than in
headquarters expense.

The severance costs resulted from the layoff of
73 employees who were all from management and administrative
functions. Geographically, the individuals were from our
locations in: Melbourne, Florida – 70 and
Other – 3. All of these individuals were notified
of their termination prior to June 27, 2003, and all will
receive severance benefits prior to August 31, 2003.

Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal

Our revenue from product sales and services for
fiscal 2002 was $1,875.8 million, a decrease of 4.1 percent
compared to fiscal 2001. Decreased revenues in our Microwave
Communications and Network Support segments were partially
offset by increased revenue in our Government Communications
Systems, RF Communications



and Broadcast Communications segments. Our income
before income taxes in fiscal 2002 was $125.1 million
compared to $72.4 million for the prior year. This increase
was primarily due to increased fiscal 2002 income before income
taxes in our Government Communications Systems, RF
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments when
compared to fiscal 2001; lower net interest expense in fiscal
2002 when compared to fiscal 2001; and the impact of the
$73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process research
and development related to the acquisition of WavTrace, Inc.
(“WavTrace”) in fiscal 2001. Income before income
taxes also increased due to goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001
that was not evident in fiscal 2002 pursuant to our
implementation of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“Statement 142”), which requires goodwill to no
longer be amortized but rather tested for impairment on a
periodic basis. These increases in income before income taxes
were partially offset by greater losses before income taxes in
our Network Support segment in fiscal 2002 when compared to
fiscal 2001; lower non-operating income in fiscal 2002 when
compared to fiscal 2001; and higher headquarters expense in
fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001. Additionally, our
Microwave Communications segment experienced a loss before
income taxes of $17.4 million in fiscal 2002 compared to a
loss of $58.8 million in fiscal 2001, which includes the
impact of the above mentioned $73.5 million write-off of
purchased in-process research and development.

Comparative Statement of
Income

Our comparative statement of income is as follows:

(1)

Fiscal 2002 includes a $10.3 million gain
    from the sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy
    Controls Systems, LLC joint venture, a $10.0 million
    write-down of our investment interest in Terion, Inc. and a
    $3.7 million write-down of marketable securities. Fiscal
    2001 includes a $33.4 million gain from the sale of our
    minority interest in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC
    joint venture and a $20.1 million write-down of marketable
    securities.

Gross Margin:

Our
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 26.5 percent in
fiscal 2002 compared to 26.8 percent in fiscal 2001, a
decrease of 0.3 percentage points. Both gross margin
improvement and higher sales volume in our RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments was offset mainly by lower
revenue and lower gross margin in our Network Support segment
due to the collapse of the DSL build-out and weakened
international market. The improved gross margin in our RF
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments came from
product cost reductions, improved manufacturing processes and
efficiencies gained on higher sales volume and favorable pricing
conditions. Our Government Communications Systems segment gross
margin also was slightly lower than the prior year due to the
August 2001 sale of our Harris Publishing Systems and
Baseview Product Subsidiaries (“Publishing Business”),
which had high margins. Additionally, the lower sales volume due
to depressed international markets in our Microwave
Communications segment in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001
negatively impacted our gross margin in fiscal 2002.



Engineering, Selling and Administrative
Expenses:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses declined from $414.4 million in
fiscal 2001 to $400.2 million in fiscal 2002. As a
percentage of revenue, they remained relatively flat at
21.2 percent of revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to 21.3
percent of revenue in fiscal 2002. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were significantly lower in our
Government Communications Systems segment due to the
August 2001 sale of our Publishing Business. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses also were significantly
lower in our Network Support and Microwave Communications
segments due to cost-cutting actions in response to
international market weakness in the microwave radio market and
general market weakness for our network support products.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses would have
declined even more in our Microwave Communications segment had
it not been for planned costs associated with the cost-cutting
actions, which included a facility closing and headcount
reductions in several locations. The reductions in engineering,
selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by
increased headquarters expense as well as increases in
engineering, selling and administrative expenses in our
Broadcast Communications segment due to our acquisition of
Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network and in our RF
Communications segment to support substantially higher sales
volume. The increase in headquarters expenses was associated
with idle facility costs and higher expenses from our
supplemental executive retirement plan, which fluctuates as a
function of the U.S. stock market.

Overall company-sponsored research and product
development costs were $103.9 million in fiscal 2002 versus
$113.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease was primarily
due to a slow-down of spending in our Microwave Communications
segment in correlation with the market delay in demand for our
pending new product introductions such as our broadband wireless
access products.

Customer-sponsored research and development,
which does not impact engineering, selling and administrative
expenses, increased from $372.5 million in fiscal 2001 to
$412.3 million in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the
U.S. Government continuing significant new spending for the War
on Terrorism.

Goodwill
Amortization:

In June 2001, the
FASB issued Statement 142. Under Statement 142, goodwill
and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized
but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets
that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be
amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). We
applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
Thus, there was no goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002 compared
to $22.2 million in fiscal 2001.

Non-Operating
Income:

Our non-operating income
decreased from $80.0 million in fiscal 2001 to
$41.0 million in fiscal 2002. Non-operating income in
fiscal 2001 includes a $33.4 million gain from the sale of
our minority interest in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC
joint venture and a $20.1 million write-down of marketable
securities. Non-operating income in fiscal 2002 includes a
$10.3 million gain from the sale of our minority interest
in our GE Harris Energy Controls Systems, LLC joint venture, a
$10.0 million write-down of our investment interest in
Terion, Inc. and a $3.7 million write-down of marketable
securities. Non-operating income also decreased as a result of
gains from the sale of securities available for sale, decreasing
from $102.5 million in fiscal 2001 to $64.2 million in
fiscal 2002, and higher legal expenses incurred in our offensive
patent infringement pursuits. The gains from the sale of
securities available for sale in both years result primarily
from the sale of shares in Intersil Corporation, which were
acquired in August 1999 in connection with the sale of our
semiconductor operations. Partially offsetting these decreases
was $7.3 million in income from our equity investments in
fiscal 2002 compared to a loss from equity investments of $9.5
million in fiscal 2001. As of June 28, 2002, we only have
one remaining investment that we account for under the equity
method of accounting, which is our minority position in LiveTV,
LLC. Expenses and fees associated with marketing and technology
projects, our selected investments and other items reduced
non-operating income by $22.8 million in fiscal 2002 and
$26.2 million in fiscal 2001.

Interest Income and Interest
Expense:

Our interest income was
unchanged at $13.3 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001. Our
interest expense decreased from $34.8 million in fiscal
2001 to $26.7 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to a
$110.5 million reduction of total debt from
$419.4 million at June 29, 2001 to $308.9 million
at June 28, 2002.

Income Taxes:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was
70.4 percent in fiscal 2001 versus 34.0 percent in
fiscal 2002. The high rate in fiscal 2001 was a result of the
non-deductibility of the write-off of purchased in-process
research and development resulting from our WavTrace
acquisition. In both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, the impact of
export sales reduced our total tax rate below the statutory
rate, including state income taxes. Fiscal 2002 also benefited
from the favorable resolution of certain outstanding state tax
liabilities, for which we had previously provided. The tax
impact of foreign source income and losses



increased our tax rates in fiscal 2002 and fiscal
2001. Fiscal 2001 also benefited from stock sales that had a
higher tax basis than the basis used in calculating gains for
financial accounting purposes. Non-deductible goodwill
amortization increased our tax rate in fiscal 2001.

Return on Revenue:

Our net income as a percentage of revenue increased from
1.1 percent in fiscal 2001 to 4.4 percent in fiscal
2002. The increase was primarily due to the reasons previously
discussed.

Selected financial information relating to
geographical regions and export sales is set forth in

Discussion of Business
Segments

Government Communications Systems
Segment

Government Communications Systems segment revenue
in fiscal 2002 increased 9.0 percent from fiscal 2001, and
income before income taxes in fiscal 2002 increased
20.6 percent from fiscal 2001. Growth in our Government
Communications Systems segment revenues underscores the general
health of this business, which continues to expand its customer
base with significant new contracts across all areas of
airborne, spaceborne and ground communications. The
segment’s operating margin continues to benefit from higher
performance award fees as well as lower operating costs due to
the sale of our Harris Publishing Systems and Baseview Products
subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.

In July 2002, our Government Communications
Systems segment won its largest contract ever — a
15-year, $1.7 billion contract to integrate and modernize
the FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure. Total value of
the program including options could reach $3.5 billion
through 2017. The FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure program
will consolidate telecommunications at more than 5,000 FAA
facilities nationwide while reducing operating costs, enhancing
network security and improving service and reliability. In the
second quarter, we won a position on the Joint Strike Fighter
program, which we consider the second largest program win in our
history. We currently expect to provide more than
$2 billion in avionics work over the anticipated 20-year
life of the program.

Also in July 2002, our Government
Communications Systems segment was awarded a one-year,
$43 million contract to provide operations and maintenance
services for the U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network’s
communications functions at Schriever AFB, Colorado and Onizuka
AFS, California. The contract contains options that could
increase the potential revenue to $355 million by 2009.

In addition, our Government Communications
Systems segment was awarded an eight-year, $200 million
contract with the U.S. Census Bureau, a new customer for us. The
program will provide a computer database of all addresses and
locations where people live or work, covering an estimated
115 million residences and 60 million businesses in
the United States. For fiscal 2002, the segment booked firm
orders for $950 million.

RF Communications Segment

RF Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2002
increased 15.8 percent from fiscal 2001, and income before
income taxes in fiscal 2002 increased 58.8 percent from fiscal
2001. This success is related in great part to our ongoing
support of the War on Terrorism with our leading-edge
Falcon® II family of secure tactical radios. Increases in
income outpaced revenue growth as manufacturing efficiencies,
product cost reductions in our Falcon® II family of
products and favorable pricing conditions were reflected in the
operating results.



During the second quarter of 2002, our RF
Communications segment won a contract with potential revenues of
more than $200 million to supply high-frequency radios for
the United Kingdom’s Bowman Tactical Radio Programme, one
of the most important land-based military projects in recent
U.K. history. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, this
segment won a key position on a program that the U.S. Department
of Defense calls its “Radio of the
Future” — the Joint Tactical Radio System.
We were selected as part of a team to provide system design,
development and production for the first “cluster” of
a five-cluster development program that will provide advanced
radio communications for all U.S. military forces. RF
Communications also plans to bid on the Joint Tactical Radio
System Clusters 2-4, which will be awarded over the next
12-24 months. The remaining clusters have a total value of
approximately $5 billion.

Microwave Communications Segment

Microwave Communications segment revenue in
fiscal 2002 decreased 32.8 percent from fiscal 2001, and the
segment recognized a loss before income taxes in fiscal 2002 of
$17.4 million compared to a loss before income taxes in
fiscal 2001 of $58.8 million. In fiscal 2001 our Microwave
Communications segment’s results include a
$73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process research
and development. Revenue and income are down in this segment
primarily as a result of weak international markets where a lack
of capital has radically reduced the expansion of telecom
infrastructure. The North American microwave market remained
healthy, driven by capacity upgrades to accommodate increased
cellular usage and the expansion of cellular infrastructure to
rural areas. We continue to maintain our leading market position
in North America, while aggressively lowering costs to cope with
the near-term market downturn in international business.

Network Support Segment

Network Support segment revenue in fiscal 2002
decreased 53.1 percent from fiscal 2001, and the segment
recognized a loss before income taxes in fiscal 2002 of
$10.3 million compared to a loss before income taxes in
fiscal 2001 of $0.6 million. This segment continues to
suffer from the collapse of the Digital Subscriber Line
build-out and weakened international markets. Cost-reduction
programs implemented in this segment earlier in fiscal 2002
helped to limit the losses of this segment in fiscal 2002.

Broadcast Communications Segment

Broadcast Communications segment revenue in
fiscal 2002 increased 5.5 percent from fiscal 2001, and income
before income taxes in fiscal 2002 increased 6.3 percent
from the prior year. These increases were largely a result of
the continuing transition of U.S. broadcasters to digital
standards, including medium to small commercial TV stations as
well as PBS stations that have to meet their FCC-mandated
guidelines for the conversion from analog to digital
broadcasting. Sales remained soft for automation and studio
systems as broadcasters continued to delay discretionary
purchases in response to low advertising revenues.



In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we acquired
the Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network business, an
Austria-based leader in European-standard digital television and
radio transmitters, for $8.6 million.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Net cash provided by operating
activities:

Our net cash provided by
operating activities was $152.8 million in fiscal 2003
compared to $206.6 million in fiscal 2002. The positive cash
flows from operating activities in fiscal 2003 are due to
continuing improved asset management in all of our segments and
strong profits and exceptional asset management performance in
our Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments. During fiscal 2003 the improved asset management
resulted in positive cash flows from inventory, unbilled costs,
trade payables, advance payments and unearned income and accrued
compensation and benefits. These improvements were partially
offset by negative cash flows from increased accounts and notes
receivable that were driven by higher fourth quarter revenues in
our RF Communications, Government Communications Systems and
Microwave Communications segments. During fiscal 2002, working
capital reduction programs in all of our segments as well as
sales volume decreases in our Network Support and Microwave
Communications segments led to decreases in inventories and
accounts and notes receivable. This improvement was partially
offset by a reduction in cash flows as a result of lower
accounts payable on lower volumes in fiscal 2002.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities:

Our net cash used in
investing activities was $29.3 million in fiscal 2003
compared to net cash provided by investing activities of
$29.3 million in fiscal 2002. Cash used in investing
activities in fiscal 2003 was due to additions of plant and
equipment of $73.0 million and cash paid for selected
investments of $5.4 million, which was partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in our LiveTV,
LLC venture of $19.0 million and proceeds from the sale of
securities available for sale of $30.1 million. Cash
provided by investing activities in fiscal 2002 was due to the
proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale of
$69.1 million and $23.0 million of proceeds from the
sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls
Systems, LLC joint venture, which was partially offset by
additions of plant and equipment of $45.9 million,
$9.4 million of cash paid for our acquisition of the
Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network business and
$7.5 million of cash paid for selected investments.

The increase in our additions of plant and
equipment from $45.9 million in fiscal 2002 to
$73.0 million in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to our
investment in a network operations command center for our FAA
Telecommunications Infrastructure program and the purchase of a
building in Rochester, New York to support the growth in our RF
Communications segment. Our total additions in fiscal 2004 are
expected to be in the $80 million to $85 million range.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities:

Our net cash provided by
financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $95.0 million
compared to net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2002
of $114.3 million. The net cash provided by financing
activities in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to net proceeds from
debt borrowings of $119.9 million, which reflects the net
receipt of $145.2 million from the private placement of
$150.0 million of our 3.5 percent convertible debentures
and the retirement of $30.5 million our 6.38 percent notes
payable during fiscal 2003. Other items included in net cash
provided by financing activities in fiscal 2003 were cash
dividends of $21.2 million, cash paid for the purchase and
retirement of common stock of $6.0 million and proceeds
from the issuance of common stock of $2.3 million upon the
exercise of options. In fiscal 2003, we issued 289,975 shares of
common stock to employees under the terms of our option and
incentive plans.

The net cash used in financing activities in
fiscal 2002 was primarily due to net payments of debt borrowings
of $110.5 million, which were primarily attributable to the
payment of $98.6 million of our 6.65 percent
debentures in fiscal 2002. Other items included in net cash used
in financing activities in fiscal 2002 were cash dividends of
$13.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of common
stock of $9.4 million upon the exercise of options. In
fiscal 2002, we issued 523,219 shares of common stock to
employees under the terms of our option and incentive plans.

In fiscal 2000, our board of directors approved a
share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up
to 15 million shares through open market transactions, in
negotiated block transactions or pursuant to tender offers. In
fiscal 2003, we used $6.0 million to repurchase 217,500
shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2002, we did not
repurchase any shares of our common stock. An authorization to
repurchase an additional 1.5 million shares under this
repurchase program still exists. We currently expect that we
will repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive
effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans.
Additionally, if warranted by market conditions, we will
consider accelerating our purchases.



Capital Structure and
Resources:

We have available a
committed syndicated credit facility with various banks that
currently provides for borrowings up to $212.5 million
under a 3-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in May 2004.
A pricing matrix based upon our long-term debt rating assigned
by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s
Investors Service determines interest rates on borrowings under
this facility and related fees. The availability of this
facility is not contingent upon our debt rating. We are not
required to maintain compensating balances in connection with
this agreement. At June 27, 2003 no amounts were borrowed
under this facility, but availability of borrowings under this
facility does enable us to issue commercial paper. The financial
covenants contained in this facility include, among others,
maintenance of consolidated tangible net worth of not less than
$813.2 million (which amount was initially
$700 million and is subject to further increase),
maintenance of a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ratio of not more than 3.0 and a
limit on total debt to $800 million. This credit facility
also includes negative covenants (i) limiting the creation
of liens or other encumbrances, (ii) limiting certain sale
and leaseback transactions, and (iii) limiting certain
sales or other dispositions of assets other than in the ordinary
course of business. In addition, this facility includes certain
provisions for acceleration of maturity in the case of a
(a) “cross default” with other indebtedness in an
amount in excess of $25 million, (b) final uninsured
judgment in excess of $25 million which remains unpaid or
discharged, or (c) change of control, including if a person
or group of persons acquires more than 25 percent of our
voting stock. Given the impending expiration of this facility,
we are assessing entering into a new facility.

We have an effective shelf registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
provides for the issuance of debt securities of up to
$500 million.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. The debentures are unsecured obligations
convertible, following certain events, into shares of our common
stock at an initial conversion price of $45.25 per share,
subject to adjustment. The debentures were issued at
100 percent of the principal amount, less a discount of
2.5 percent to the initial purchasers. We may redeem the
debentures commencing August 2007 at 100 percent of
the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may require
us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in part, on
specified dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017 or upon the occurrence of
certain other events at 100 percent of the principal amount
plus accrued interest. The debentures bear interest at an annual
rate of 3.5 percent. The interest rate will be reset in
August 2007, 2012 and 2017, but in no event will it be
reset below 3.5 percent or above 5.5 percent per annum.

In addition to our $150 million 3.5%
convertible debentures, we have outstanding unsecured long-term
debt of $251.6 million. The earliest scheduled maturity of
any long-term debt is 2007.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit
aggregating $54.8 million from various U.S. and
international banks, of which $23.6 million was available
on June 27, 2003. These lines provide for borrowings at
various interest rates, typically may be terminated upon notice,
may be used on such terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and
us and are reviewed annually for renewal or modification. These
lines do not require compensating balances. We have a short-term
commercial paper program in place, which we may utilize to
satisfy short-term cash requirements. This program has not been
used since the private placement on August 26, 2002 of
$150 million of our 3.5% convertible debentures. There were
no borrowings under the commercial paper program at
June 27, 2003.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB” by
Standard and Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by
Moody’s Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating
ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios
sufficient for retention of these debt ratings. However, there
are no assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in
the future. If our credit rating is lowered below
“investment grade,” we may not be able to issue
short-term commercial paper, but would instead need to borrow
under our other credit facilities or look for other alternatives.

Management currently believes that existing cash,
funds generated from operations, sales of marketable securities,
the credit facilities and access to the public and private debt
markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated
requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases, if any, under the current repurchase program for
the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.



At June 27, 2003 we had contractual cash
obligations to repay debt (including capital lease obligations,
which are immaterial), to purchase goods and services and to
make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these
long-term obligations are as follows:

The purchase obligations of $347.2 million
noted above include $267.7 million of purchase obligations
related to our Government Communications Systems segment, which
are fully funded under contracts with the U.S. Government.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements:

We have entered into
surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other
arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily
relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain
contracts to provide products and services to customers and to
obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers.

At June 27, 2003 we had commitments related
to contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit,
guarantees and other arrangements, as follows:

We do not have material financial guarantees or
other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect liquidity. In addition, we do not have any
related party transactions that materially affect our results of
operations, cash flow or financial condition.



Comparative Financial
    Position:

Our comparative financial position is as follows:

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

Our cash and cash
equivalents increased $216.4 million in fiscal 2003 due
primarily to the net receipt of $145.2 million from the
private placement of convertible debentures, cash provided by
operating activities of $152.8 million as discussed above,
cash receipts related to the sale of our minority interest in
our LiveTV, LLC venture of $19.0 million and proceeds from
the sale of securities available for sale of $30.1 million.
These increases were partially offset by the repayment of our
$30.5 million 6.38 percent notes payable to banks,
$73.0 million in additions of plant and equipment,
$21.2 million of cash dividends paid and $6.0 million
paid to repurchase 217,500 shares of our common stock.

Marketable
Securities:

Our marketable securities
decreased from $52.2 million as of June 28, 2002 to
$23.1 million as of June 27, 2003. The decrease was
primarily due to our sale of a portion of our holdings in
Intersil Corporation and the sale of the remainder of our
holdings in Advanced Fibre Communications, Inc. and Synopsis,
Inc.

Working Capital:

Our
working capital increased 18.5 percent from $727.9 million
as of June 28, 2002 to $862.2 million as of
June 27, 2003. The $134.3 million increase was due
primarily to increases in cash and cash equivalents as discussed
above.

Goodwill:

Our
goodwill increased from $215.2 million as of June 28,
2002 to $228.1 million as of June 27, 2003. The
increase was due primarily to the final allocation of the
purchase price related to the Broadcast Communications
segment’s acquisition of Hirschmann Multimedia
Communications Network business and foreign currency translation
adjustments.

Non-Current Deferred Income Tax
Asset:

Our non-current deferred income
tax asset was $26.0 million as of June 28, 2002 versus
$20.4 million as of June 27, 2003. The decrease is
primarily due to lower amounts of tax loss and credit
carryforwards net of valuation allowances. For additional
information, see

Note 22: Income Taxes

in our Notes to
Financial Statements.

Purchased In-Process Research and
Development

In August 2000, we purchased WavTrace, a
developer of broadband microwave radio systems for high-speed
wireless access to the Internet and other data, voice and video
services. Prior to the acquisition, we owned slightly less than
20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase price for the
remaining approximately 80 percent is valued at
$144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as follows:



In connection with the acquisition, we allocated
$73.5 million of the purchase price to an in-process
research and development project. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the
development of this project had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal
2001.

In making the purchase price allocation to
in-process research and development, we relied on present value
calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments
and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution
and project risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process
research and development were associated with one significant
research project for which technological feasibility had not
been established. This project was for the development of the
ClearBurst™ GB product (formerly known as the PM 2000).

ClearBurst™ GB is a point-to-multipoint
microwave radio system that is a broadband wireless option to
deliver the Internet and other multimedia services at speeds up
to 180 Mbp/s per user. The ClearBurst™ GB with BigBurst
airlink will use adaptive time division duplexing, which is
expected to allow for 100 percent efficient use of the
available spectrum. ClearBurst™ GB will also use dynamic
asymmetry to adjust for the different data traffic levels of
small and large customers. The technology allocates bandwidth
between the uplink and downlink of a frequency channel to
accommodate traffic. As a result, adaptive time division
duplexing is expected to provide greater efficiency than
predecessor technologies and support 15 times more customers
than previous technologies. The estimated stage of completion of
the ClearBurst™ GB project at the time of the acquisition
was 80 percent (considering time-based, cost-based and
milestone-based completion measures). ClearBurst™ GB does
not have any significant leverage on any existing technology
developed outside of this project.

The value assigned to purchased in-process
research and development was determined by estimating the costs
to develop the purchased in-process research and development
into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash
flows to their present value using a discount rate of
35 percent.

During fiscal 2003, primary development efforts
for this in-process research and development project were
completed and the business responsibility and project engineers
were transferred from the Microwave Communications segment to
the Government Communications Systems segment. We believe this
technology will generate economic benefits over several years
within the Government Communications Systems segment.

Retirement Plans

Retirement benefits for substantially all of our
employees are provided primarily through a defined contribution
retirement plan having profit sharing and savings elements. We
also provide limited health-care benefits to retirees who have
10 or more years of service. All of our obligations under our
retirement plans have been fully funded by our contributions,
the provision for which totaled $58.0 million in fiscal
2003.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 47 percent of our
international business is transacted in local currency
environments. The impact of translating the assets and
liabilities of these operations to U.S. dollars is included as a
component of shareholders’ equity. At June 27, 2003,
the cumulative translation adjustment reduced shareholders’
equity by $13.0 million compared to a reduction of $22.8
million at June 28, 2002.

We utilize foreign currency hedging instruments
to minimize the currency risk of international transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did
not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2003, 2002
or 2001.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently
followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the
impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for
employees and the cost of purchased materials and services.

Market Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates, fluctuations in the market value of our equity securities
available for sale and changes in interest rates. We employ
established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.



Foreign Exchange and
Currency:

We use foreign exchange
contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and future
foreign currency commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange
contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and
purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable from
and future committed sales to customers and intercompany loans.
We believe the use of foreign currency financial instruments
should reduce the risks that arise from doing business in
international markets. At June 27, 2003, we had open
foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
$95.7 million, of which $18.1 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $77.6 million were classified as
fair value hedges. This compares to total foreign exchange
contracts with a notional amount of $83.5 million as of
June 28, 2002, of which $44.8 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $38.7 million were classified as
fair value hedges. At June 27, 2003, contract expiration
dates range from less than one month to two years with a
weighted average contract life of 0.3 years.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the United
Kingdom Bowman Programme in our RF Communications segment. This
contract for our tactical radio products was awarded in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer
pays in Pounds Sterling (“GBP”). We also have payments
to local suppliers in GBP on this program. We have hedged the
forecasted sales and vendor payments denominated in GBP to
maintain our anticipated profit margin in U.S. dollars. As of
June 27, 2003, we estimated that a pretax loss of
$0.1 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next two years related to these
transactions.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal
2003 and 2002 representing the amount of fair value and cash
flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was $0.2 million and
$0.7 million, respectively. No amounts were recognized in
our earnings in fiscal 2003 and 2002 related to the component of
the derivative instruments’ gain or loss excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were
recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2003 and 2002 related to
hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
value on the balance sheet in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”).

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of
our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of
sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
derivatives held at June 27, 2003 would have an impact of
approximately $9.3 million on the fair value of such
instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
commitments.

Marketable
Securities:

We currently have a
portfolio of marketable equity securities available for sale.
These investments result from the retained interest in sold or
spun-off businesses and the investment into start-up companies
that have technology or products that are of interest to us. The
fair market value of these securities at June 27, 2003, was
$23.1 million compared to $52.2 million at
June 28, 2002. This decrease was due primarily to the sale
of some of these investments in fiscal 2003. The unrealized
gains and losses related to our marketable securities are
included as a component of shareholders’ equity. These
investments historically have had higher volatility than most
market indices. A 10 percent adverse change in the quoted
market price of marketable equity securities would have an
impact of approximately $2.3 million on the fair market
value of these securities.

We utilize option contracts from time to time in
the form of cashless collars to hedge anticipated cash flows
from the sale of marketable securities. Contracts are generally
one year or less. At June 27, 2003, we had no open option
contracts, which compares to open option contracts for 175,000
shares of Intersil Corporation stock at a weighted average
strike price of $32.26 as of June 28, 2002. These collars
were classified as cash flow hedges and recorded at their fair
value on the balance sheet in accordance with Statement 133. The
fair market value of these collars, reflected in the caption
“Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
June 28, 2002, was $1.9 million. Factors that could
impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for marketable
securities include accuracy of cash flow estimates, volatility
of security markets and the cost and availability of hedging
instruments.

Interest Rates:

We
utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both
fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and available lines of credit
to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates. We do not
expect



changes in interest rates to have a material
effect on income or cash flows in fiscal 2004, although there
can be no assurances that interest rates will not change
significantly.

Environmental Matters

We are actively engaged in complying with
environmental protection laws and we have ongoing internal
compliance programs. The cost of environmental capital projects
in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was immaterial. We estimate that the
cost in fiscal 2004 for environmental-related capital projects
also will be immaterial. Under the Superfund Act or similar
state environmental laws, we also have potential liability at
various waste sites designated for clean up. We are named as a
potentially responsible party at 14 such sites where future
liabilities could exist. These sites include two sites owned by
us, eight sites associated with our former graphics or
semiconductor locations and four treatment or disposal sites not
owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
attributable to us from past operations. Four of the eight sites
associated with our former graphics or semiconductor sites were
sold to Intersil Corporation. We routinely assess our
contingencies, obligations and commitments to clean up and
monitor sites in light of in-depth studies, analysis by
environmental experts and legal reviews. At the two sites we own
and at five sites associated with our former locations, we are
involved primarily in monitoring and remediation programs that
have been implemented in cooperation with various environmental
agencies. At one of the sites associated with our former
locations, we have provided indemnification to the purchaser for
potential undiscovered future liabilities, and at another we
have provided indemnification to the purchaser for liabilities
for which we, in turn, have been indemnified by a prior owner.
At the other sites, we are involved as one of numerous
potentially responsible parties.

In ascertaining environmental exposures, we must
assess the extent of contamination, the nature of remedial
actions, continually evolving governmental standards and the
number, participation level and financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties and other similar variables.
Based upon internal and third-party studies, as well as the
remediation and monitoring expense history at the two sites we
own and at six of the eight sites associated with our former
locations, the number and solvency of potentially responsible
parties at the other sites and an assessment of other relevant
factors, we have estimated that our discounted liability under
the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent
discount rate, is approximately $3.9 million. This
liability is accrued in the June 27, 2003 Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that
will be incurred over the next 20 to 25 years (depending on
the number of years for each site) is approximately
$6.4 million. The expected payments for the next five years
are: fiscal 2004 — $0.4 million; fiscal 2005 —
$0.6 million; fiscal 2006 — $0.6 million; fiscal
2007 — $0.6 million; fiscal 2008 — $0.4
million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is approximately
$3.8 million. For additional information regarding
environmental matters, see Item 3 “Legal
Proceedings.”

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

As described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes

in our Notes to Financial Statements, there are accounting
pronouncements that have recently been issued but not yet
implemented by us. Note 2 describes the potential impact that
these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

Outlook

Our two government communications businesses are
driving outstanding growth, and we expect continuing strong
performance from both in fiscal 2004. Growth in these two
businesses is driven not only by significant new communications
infrastructure programs by the U.S. and other countries around
the world, but also by our ability to understand customer needs,
to apply leading-edge technology to system requirements and to
outperform expectations on a regular basis.

We continue to believe in the long-term potential
of the telecom and broadcast markets. Operating income in each
of our commercial businesses is expected to show noticeable
improvement in fiscal 2004, as a result of the cumulative
effects of cost-reduction actions at the divisions and at the
corporate headquarters. We also have maintained aggressive
research and development activities, and each business has
extensive product and market leadership positions. As the
markets improve in fiscal 2004 and beyond, we are on solid
footing to serve a growing customer base.

Non-operating income will likely be minimal,
compared to $23.7 million in fiscal 2003. However, we have
received recent positive rulings in two intellectual property
litigation cases, against Sanyo North America Corporation and
Ericsson, Inc., with an approximate combined net value of
$50 million. Awards in these cases



could increase non-operating income in fiscal
2004, but the results of appeals, ultimate outcome and the
timing of any potential payments cannot be predicted. We remain
strongly committed to using our technology assets to create
additional shareholder returns in the future.

Application of Critical Accounting
Policies

In preparing our financial statements and
accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we
apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our Notes to
Financial Statements. We consider the policies discussed below
as critical to an understanding of our financial statements
because their application places the most significant demands on
our judgment, with financial reporting results relying on
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any
associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations are discussed throughout this “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” where such policies affect our reported and
expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the
application of these and other accounting policies, see

Note
1: Significant Accounting Policies

in our Notes to Financial
Statements. Senior management has discussed the development and
selection of the critical accounting policies and the related
disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee of our board
of directors. Preparation of this Annual Report requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the
“critical” accounting policy criteria, we make many
other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements
and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed
critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and
other information available prior to the issuance of the
financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known,
including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts
    and Contract Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived
from long-term development and production contracts, which are
accounted for under the provisions of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position
No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP 81-1”). Revenues related to long-term contracts
are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method generally
measured by the costs incurred on each contract to-date against
estimated total contract costs at completion
(“cost-to-cost”) with consideration given for risk of
performance and estimated profit. The percentage-of-completion
method of revenue recognition is used in our Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications, Broadcast
Communications and Microwave Communications segments. Revenues
are recorded on certain long-term production contracts within
our RF Communications segment using the units of delivery method
rather than the cost-to-cost method. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items that may change the scope of a contract
are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated
and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award
fees applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally
are not recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally
are not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the
segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.

Recognition of profit on long-term contracts
requires estimates of: the contract value or total contract
revenue; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
progress toward completion. The estimated profit or loss on a
contract is equal to the difference between the estimated
contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. Due
to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the
estimated total cost at completion often requires significant
judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work
to be completed include labor productivity and availability of
labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
availability of materials, subcontractor performance, the impact
of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from
the customer and the recoverability of claims outside the
original contract included in any estimate to complete. We
review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing
and



acquired contracts at least quarterly and in many
cases more frequently. If a change in estimated cost to complete
a contract is determined to have an impact on contract earnings,
we will record a positive or negative adjustment to estimated
earnings when identified. As of June 27, 2003 the amount of
unbilled costs and accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $164.8 million compared
to $178.6 million as of June 28, 2002. These amounts
include gross costs and accrued income, which is netted against
billings and progress payments. A significant change in an
estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on
our statement of financial position and results of operations.
For example, a one percent variance in our estimate of accrued
income booked as of June 27, 2003 on all open fixed-price
contracts would impact our pretax income and our cost of product
sales and services by $4.3 million.

Provisions for Excess and Obsolete
    Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or
market. We balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels
to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of
excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and
customer requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities
on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. The review of excess and obsolete
inventory primarily relates to our Microwave Communications,
Broadcast Communications, Network Support and RF Communications
segments. Several factors may influence the sale and use of our
inventories, including our decisions to exit a product line,
technological change and new product development. These factors
could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory
quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future
product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may
have understated or overstated the provision required for excess
and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our
inventory was overvalued, we would be required to recognize such
costs in “Cost of product sales and services” in our
Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
determination. Likewise, if we determine our inventory is
undervalued, we may have overstated “Cost of product sales
and services” in previous periods and would be required to
recognize such additional income. As of June 27, 2003, our
reserve for obsolete and excess inventory was $43.7 million
or 17 percent of our gross inventory balance, which
compares to our reserve of $38.5 million or 14 percent
of the gross inventory balance as of June 28, 2002. We
recorded $24.4 million, $20.6 million and
$10.5 million in inventory write-down charges during fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In fiscal 2003, inventory
write-downs of $17.6 million related to our exit of
unprofitable products in our Microwave Communications and
Network Support segments and the shutdown of our Brazilian
manufacturing plant in the Microwave Communications segment. In
fiscal 2002, inventory write-downs were primarily due to the
slow-down in demand for our Microwave Communications
segment’s products as a result of weak international
markets where a lack of capital radically reduced the expansion
of telecom infrastructure. Although we make every reasonable
effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product
demand, including the impact of planned future product launches,
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
inventory and our reported operating results. For example, a
10 percent variance in our estimate of the amount of excess
and obsolete inventory would impact our pretax income and our
cost of product sales and services by $4.4 million.

Accounts and Finance Receivables Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses

In our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments, a substantial majority of our revenues
and, consequently, our outstanding accounts receivable, are
directly or indirectly with the U.S. Government. Therefore, our
risk of not collecting amounts due us under such arrangements is
minimal. In our Microwave Communications, Broadcast
Communications and Network Support segments, our revenues are
supported by contractual arrangements specifying the timing and
amounts of payments. In addition, we often require letters of
credit or deposit payments prior to the commencement of work or
obtain progress payments from our customers upon the achievement
of certain milestones. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer
payment history and current creditworthiness, as determined by
our review of our customers’ current credit information. We
also have obtained credit insurance for some international
customers that we have determined to be a credit risk. We
continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers
and maintain a provision for estimated collection losses based
upon our historical experience and any specific customer
collection issues we have identified. While such credit losses
have generally been within our expectations and the provisions
established, we cannot guarantee we will continue to experience
the same credit loss rates we have in the past. Measurement of
such losses requires consideration of historical loss
experience, including the need to adjust for current conditions,
and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable
data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency
rates and financial health of specific customers. We
historically have experienced and expect to continue to
experience a minimal amount of uncollectible accounts
receivable. As of June 27, 2003, our



allowance for collection losses was
$13.2 million or 3 percent of our gross trade
receivable balance compared to an allowance for collection
losses as of June 28, 2002 of $16.7 million or
4 percent of our gross trade receivable balance. We
recorded $9.2 million, $6.0 million and
$3.0 million in provisions for doubtful accounts for both
our accounts and finance receivables in our Consolidated
Statement of Income for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure
the accuracy of our estimate of future collection losses, any
significant unanticipated changes in our customers’
credit-worthiness could have a significant impact on these
estimates. For example, a 10 percent variance in our
estimate of future collection losses would impact our pretax
income and our engineering, selling and administrative expenses
by $1.3 million.

Valuation of Marketable Securities and
    Selected Investments

Marketable securities included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet are reflected in the financial
statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses related to marketable securities are
reflected in other comprehensive income unless unrealized losses
are considered to be other than temporary. Where available, we
use prices from independent sources, such as listed market
prices or broker or dealer price quotations. Selected
investments are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting and are evaluated for impairment if cost exceeds fair
value. For these investments that are illiquid and privately
held securities that do not have readily determinable fair
values, the determination of fair value requires management to
obtain independent appraisals, or to estimate the value of the
securities without an independent appraisal based upon available
information such as projected cash flows, comparable market
prices of similar companies, recent acquisitions of similar
companies made in the marketplace and a review of the financial
and market conditions of the underlying company. We use judgment
in estimating the fair value based on our evaluation of the
investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate, terminal
value and perpetuity rate to apply in our calculations. In
instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition,
even where the value of a security is derived from an
independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain
assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For
instance, we generally assume the size of positions in
securities we hold would not be large enough to affect the
quoted price of the securities if we sell them and any such sale
would happen in an orderly manner. These assumptions, however,
may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition
could be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate
our securities for “other than temporary” impairment.
Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment
security has been below the current value for an extended period
of time, which we generally define as nine months. If an
“other than temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the investment
security recorded on the financial statements and our current
fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period
in which the impairment is determined to be other than
temporary. As of June 27, 2003, we own approximately
$23.1 million of marketable securities, which have prices
from independent sources such as listed market prices and
$38.8 million of selected investments that are included in
the “Other assets” caption in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, for which we have obtained independent appraisals. We
make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our
estimate of the value of our marketable securities and selected
investments. Any significant unanticipated changes in listed
market prices, broker or dealer price quotations, or in the
underlying assumptions used by independent appraisers or us
could have a significant impact on these estimates. For example,
a 10 percent decrease in our estimate in the fair value of our
marketable securities and selected investments that was other
than temporary would impact our pretax income and our
non-operating income by $5.4 million.

Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement 142, we are
required to perform an annual (or under certain circumstances
more frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill
impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first
step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify
potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting
unit, which we define as our business segments, with its net
book value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second
step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if



the reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

There are many assumptions and estimates
underlying the determination of the fair value of the reporting
unit. These assumptions include projected cash flows, discount
rates, comparable market prices of similar businesses, recent
acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace and a
review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying
business. We completed impairment tests as of March 28,
2003 with no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 27,
2003 and June 28, 2002 was $228.1 million and
$215.2 million, respectively. Although we make every
reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the
fair value of our reporting units, future changes in the
assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the
recording of an impairment loss. For example, a 10 percent
variance in our estimate of our Microwave Communications
segment’s fair value could result in us performing the
second step of the impairment test as described above for the
$24.1 million of goodwill carried in this segment. A
10 percent decrease, however, in our estimate of any of our
other reporting units would not lead to any further tests for
impairment.

Income Taxes and Tax Valuation
    Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax
jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets
recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation
allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax
assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning
strategies. Our valuation allowance related to deferred income
taxes, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was
$20.1 million as of June 27, 2003 and $6.5 million as
of June 28, 2002. If we continue to operate at a loss in
certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient
future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the
actual effective tax rates or time period within which the
underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible,
we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against
all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets
resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate
and a material adverse impact on our operating results. For
example, a 10 percent variance in our estimate of valuation
allowance related to deferred income taxes would impact our
provision for income taxes and net income by $2.0 million.

Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that
May Affect Future Results

The following are some of the factors we believe
could cause our actual results to differ materially from
expected and historical results. Other factors besides those
listed here also could adversely affect us.

We currently are experiencing uncertain
economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
in our markets and, as a result, future income and
expenditures.

Current conditions in the domestic and global
economies are extremely uncertain. As a result, it is difficult
to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole. It
is even more difficult to estimate growth in various parts of
the economy, including some of the markets in which we
participate. Because all components of our budgeting and
forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
markets we serve, the prevailing economic uncertainty renders
estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult
than usual. As a result, we may make significant investments and
expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits, which
could adversely affect our results of operations. The future
direction of the overall domestic and global economies will have
a significant impact on our overall performance.

The severe telecommunications slowdown has
had a negative impact on our telecom businesses and continued
weakness could further hurt our operations.

During the past several years there has been a
severe downturn and tightening of international capital markets
for the telecommunication, cellular and wireless telephone
industry in general. Additionally, the competitive local
exchange carrier business has experienced a severe downturn and
many competitive local exchange carriers have ceased operations
or have scaled back operations significantly. This slowdown has
had an adverse impact upon our network support and microwave
communications businesses.



We depend on the U.S. Government for a
significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of this
relationship or a shift in U.S. Government funding could
have adverse consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the U.S.
Government. Approximately 62 percent, 54 percent and
42 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001 were derived from sales to the U.S. Government. Therefore,
any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship
with the U.S. Government could significantly reduce our
revenues. Our U.S. Government programs must compete with
programs managed by other defense contractors for a limited
number of programs and for uncertain levels of funding. Our
competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their
business relationships with the U.S. Government and will
continue these efforts in the future. The U.S. Government may
choose to use other defense contractors for its limited number
of defense programs. In addition, the funding of defense
programs also competes with nondefense spending of the U.S.
Government. Budget decisions made by the U.S. Government are
outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our
business. A shift in U.S. Government defense spending to
other programs in which we are not involved, or a reduction in
U.S. Government defense spending generally, could have adverse
consequences on our business.

We derive a significant portion of our
revenues from international revenues and are subject to the
risks of doing business in foreign countries including
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We are highly dependent on sales to customers
outside the United States. In fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
revenues from products exported from the U.S. or manufactured
abroad were 20 percent, 22 percent and
29 percent, respectively, of our total revenues.
Approximately 47 percent of our international business in
fiscal 2003 was transacted in local currency environments.
Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely
affect our results. We expect that international revenues will
continue to account for a significant portion of our total
revenues. Also, a significant portion of our international
revenues are in less developed countries. As a result, we are
subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:

While these factors or the impact of these
factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could
adversely affect our operations in the future.

The fair values of our portfolio of passive
investments are subject to significant price volatility or
erosion.

We maintain portfolio holdings of various issuers
and types of securities. These securities generally are
classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Part of our
portfolio includes minority equity investments in several
publicly-traded companies. Because the majority of these
securities represent investments in technology companies, the
fair market values of these securities are subject to
significant price volatility and, in general, suffered a
significant decline during fiscal 2002 and 2003. In addition,
the realizable value of these securities is subject to market
and other conditions. We also have invested in numerous
privately held companies, many of which still can be considered
in the start-up or developmental stages. These investments are
illiquid and are inherently risky as the markets for the
technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose our entire investment in these companies.



Our future success will depend on our
ability to develop new products that achieve market
acceptance.

Both our commercial and defense businesses are
characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving
industry standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends
on a number of factors, including our ability to:

We believe that, in order to remain competitive
in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products,
which will require the investment of significant financial
resources in new product development. The need to make these
expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other
projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures
ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products.
Due to the design complexity of some of our products, we may
experience delays in completing development and introducing new
products in the future. Any delays could result in increased
costs of development or redirect resources from other projects.
In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for
our products will develop as we currently anticipate. The
failure of our products to gain market acceptance could reduce
significantly our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore,
we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop
competing products that gain market acceptance in advance of our
products or that our competitors will not develop new products
that cause our existing products to become obsolete. If we fail
in our new product development efforts or our products fail to
achieve market acceptance more rapidly than those of our
competitors, our revenues will decline and our business,
financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
affected.

We cannot predict the consequences of
future geo-political events, but they may affect adversely the
markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against
risks, our operations or our profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on
September 11, 2001, the subsequent U.S.-led military
response and the potential for future terrorist activities and
other recent geo-political events, have created economic and
political uncertainties that could have a material adverse
effect on our business and the prices of our securities. These
matters have caused uncertainty in the world’s financial
and insurance markets and may increase significantly the
political, economic and social instability in the geographic
areas in which we operate. These matters also have caused the
premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase and may
cause some coverages to be unavailable altogether. While our
government businesses have benefited from homeland defense
initiatives and the War on Terrorism, these developments may
affect adversely our business and profitability and the prices
of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

We have made, and may continue to make,
strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make,
strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include:



We depend significantly on our U.S.
Government contracts, which are only partially funded, subject
to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The
termination or failure to fund one or more of these contracts
could have an adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may
be implemented by the award of many different individual
contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government
programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although
multi-year contracts may be planned or authorized in connection
with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds
on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for
several years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial
funding initially, and additional funds are committed only as
Congress makes further appropriations. The termination of
funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenues attributable to that program. That
could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
funds to a program that already has been started could result in
lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject
to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment of
compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time
of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under these
circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be
able to procure new contracts to offset the revenues lost as a
result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts.
Because a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on
our procurement, performance and payment under our U.S.
Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to
specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic
and other requirements. These requirements, although customary
in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
debarment are violations of various statutes, including those
related to procurement integrity, export control,
U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the
recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
could have an adverse effect on our reputation and ability to
procure other U.S. Government contracts in the future. We
currently are cooperating with certain U.S. Government
representatives in investigations relating to potential
violations of foreign corrupt practices, export controls and
other laws. No assurance can be given that the outcome of these
investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or our business as a whole.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that
could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost
overruns.

Sometimes, we enter into contracts on a firm,
fixed-price basis. During fiscal 2003 approximately
70 percent of our total Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments’ sales were from fixed-price
contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it
carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume
all of the cost risk. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we
can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government
contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the
U.S. Government can compel us to complete a project or, in
certain circumstances, pay the entire cost of its replacement by
another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any
cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because
many of these projects involve new technologies and applications
and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological
difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials,
problems with other contractors and cost overruns, can result in
the contractual price becoming less favorable or even
unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet
project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
results.



The inability of our subcontractors to
perform, or our key suppliers to manufacture and deliver our
components or products, could cause our products to be produced
in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

On several of our U.S. government contracts,
we engage subcontractors. In addition, there are certain parts
or components, which we source from other manufacturers. Some of
our suppliers from time to time experience financial and
operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to
supply the materials, components and subsystems that we require.
Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a
cost-effective basis could materially impair our ability to
manufacture and deliver our products to customers in a timely
manner. We cannot give assurances that we will not experience
material supply problems or component or subsystems problems in
the future. Also, our subcontractors may not be able to maintain
the quality of our products, which might result in greater
product returns and could harm our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Third parties have claimed in the past and
may claim in the future that we are infringing upon their
intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property, which
has resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation. Third
parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and
we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights.
We do not believe that existing claims of infringement will have
a material impact on us; however, we may be unaware of
intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
our technology, products and services.

Claims of intellectual property infringement
might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license
agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or
license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also
may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against
development and sale of certain of our products.

Our success depends in large part on our
proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality
provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our
intellectual property rights, our competitive position could
suffer. Our pending patent and trademark registration
applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge
the validity or scope of these patents or trademark
registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a
significant competitive advantage.

We may be required to spend significant resources
to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may
not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position
may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may
design around our technology or develop competing technologies.

We are subject to customer demand for
financing and customer credit risk.

The competitive environment in which we operate
historically has required us, and many of our principal
competitors, to provide medium-term and long-term customer
financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
or non-recourse basis. Our success for some of our businesses
may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer
financing on competitive terms. While we generally have been
able to place a portion of our customer financings with
third-party lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this
risk, a portion of these financings is provided directly by us.
There can be higher risks associated with some of these
financings, particularly when provided to start-up operations
such as local network providers, to customers in developing
countries or to customers in specific financing-intensive areas
of the telecommunications industry. If customers fail to meet
their obligations, losses could be incurred and such losses
could have an adverse effect on us. Our losses could be much
greater if it becomes more difficult to place or insure against
these risks with third parties. This also may put us at a
competitive disadvantage to competitors with greater financial
resources. We have various programs in place to monitor and
mitigate customer credit risk; however, we cannot provide
assurances that such measures will be effective in reducing our
exposure to our customers’ credit risk. Continued weakness
in the general economy, and the telecommunications industry in
particular, may result in increased defaults by customers and
increased losses.



We have undertaken cost reductions, which
may not yield the benefits we expect and could have adverse
effects on our future business.

We are implementing cost-cutting measures
throughout our Company. There are risks inherent in our efforts
to reduce costs. These include the risk that we will not be able
to reduce expenditures quickly enough or to sustain the
reductions at a level necessary to improve profitability and
that we may have to undertake additional cost-cutting measures.
In addition, there is the risk that cost-cutting initiatives
will impair our ability to effectively develop and market
products and remain competitive. Any of these measures could
have a long-term effect on our businesses by reducing our pool
of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our
products, making it more difficult for us to respond to
customers, and limiting our ability to hire and retain key
personnel.

Developing new technologies entails
significant risks and uncertainties.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to
the products and services we provide. A significant portion of
our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing
advanced defense and technology systems and products. New
technologies associated with these systems and products may be
untested or unproven. Components of certain of the defense
systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous.
Failures of satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control
systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the
potential to cause loss of life and extensive property damage.
In most circumstances we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks,
the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to
cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs from an accident. It also is not possible to
obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and
liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in
excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our insurance
coverage could harm our financial condition and operating
results. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are
liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our
reputation among our customers and the public, thereby making it
more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could
significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
insurance in the future.

ITEM  7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
    MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates, fluctuations in the market value of our marketable equity
securities available for sale and changes in interest rates. We
employ established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. For
a discussion of such policies and procedures and the related
risks, see “Market Risk Management” in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated
by reference into this Item 7A.

submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange



Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

(b)

Changes in internal controls:

There have been no changes (including corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses)
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To Harris Directors and
Shareholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries as of
June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and comprehensive
income and shareholders’ equity for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended June 27, 2003. Our audits
also include the financial statement schedule listed in the
index Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Harris Corporation and
subsidiaries at June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
June 27, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation —

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.
As used in these notes, the terms “Harris”,
“we,” “our” and “us” refer to
Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated.

Use of Estimates —

These statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and require management to make estimates and
assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year —

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday
nearest June 30. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 include
52 weeks.

Cash Equivalents —

Cash equivalents are temporary cash
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. These investments include accrued interest and are
carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable equity securities are
stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, included as a separate component of shareholders’
equity. Realized gains and losses from marketable securities are
determined using the specific identification method. In
instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an
“other than temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the investment
security recorded on the financial statements and our current
estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in
the period in which the impairment is determined. The cost basis
of marketable securities was $22.8 million at June 27,
2003 and $31.8 million at June 28, 2002. The proceeds
from the sale of marketable securities were $30.1 million
in fiscal 2003, $69.1 million in fiscal 2002 and
$127.4 million in fiscal 2001. The amount of realized gains
included in “Non-operating income” was
$21.2 million in fiscal 2003, $60.5 million in fiscal
2002 and $82.4 million in fiscal 2001. Included in these
realized gains were write-downs for other than temporary
decreases in the market value of $0.7 million in fiscal 2003,
$3.7 million in fiscal 2002 and $20.1 million in
fiscal 2001.

Selected Investments —

Selected investments are equity
investments in privately held securities that do not have
readily determinable fair values. Selected investments are
accounted for using the cost method of accounting and are
evaluated for impairment if cost exceeds fair value. The
determination of fair value requires management to obtain
independent appraisals, or to estimate the value of the
securities without an independent appraisal based upon available
information such as projected cash flows, comparable market
prices of similar companies, recent acquisitions of similar
companies made in the marketplace and a review of the financial
and market conditions of the underlying company. In fiscal 2002
“Non-operating income” in our Consolidated Statement
of Income included a $10.0 million write-down related to an
impairment of our investment in Terion, Inc. As of June 27,
2003, we own approximately $38.8 million of selected investments
that are included in the “Other assets” caption in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet, for which we have obtained
independent appraisals. See Note 9: Selected Investments for
additional information regarding selected investments.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments —

The carrying
amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, cost method
investments, receivables, notes receivables and short-term and
long-term debt approximate their fair values. Fair values are
based primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
instruments or independent appraisals. A discussion of fair
values for our derivative financial instruments is included
under the caption “Financial Instruments and Risk
Management” in this Significant Accounting Policies note.

Inventories —

Inventories are priced at the lower of
cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out methods) or
market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and
record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. See Note 5: Inventories and Unbilled
Costs for additional information regarding inventories.

Plant and Equipment —

Plant and equipment are carried on the
basis of cost. Depreciation of buildings, machinery and
equipment is computed by the straight-line and accelerated
methods. The estimated useful lives



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

of buildings range between 5 and 50 years.
The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment range
between 3 and 10 years. See Note 6: Plant and Equipment for
additional information regarding plant and equipment.

Income Taxes —

We follow the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets
and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax
jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets
recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation
allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax
assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning
strategies. See Note 22: Income Taxes for additional information
regarding income taxes.

Goodwill —

Goodwill represents the excess cost of
a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”), indefinite-life
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as our business segments, with its net book
value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any
unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
reporting unit. See Note 7: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for additional information regarding goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Identifiable Intangible Assets —

We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between
the fair value and the carrying amount. See Note 7: Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding
identifiable intangible assets.

Other Accrued Items and Other
Assets —

No accrued
liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other accrued
items” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed 5 percent
of our total current liabilities as of June 27, 2003 and as
of June 28, 2002. No current assets other than those
already disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed 5
percent of our total current assets as of June 27, 2003 or
as of June 28, 2002. No assets within the caption
“Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
exceed 5 percent of total assets as of June 27, 2003 or as
of June 28, 2002.

Warranties —

On product sales in our RF
Communications, Microwave Communications, Network Support and
Broadcast Communications segments, we provide for future
warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific terms and
conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product
sold and country in which we do business. In the case of
hardware manufactured by us, our warranties generally start from
the delivery date and continue as follows:



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Longer warranty periods are provided on a limited
basis including some “lifetime” warranties on some of
our small tools in the Network Support segment.

Software products in our Broadcast Communications
and Network Support segments generally carry a 90-day warranty
from the date of acceptance. Our liability under these
warranties is to provide a corrected copy of any portion of the
software found not to be in substantial compliance with the
specifications previously agreed to. This may result in, but
does not guarantee, the customer receiving a free upgrade to a
new release of our software.

Because our products are manufactured, in many
cases, to customer specifications and their acceptance is based
on meeting those specifications, we historically have
experienced minimal warranty costs. Factors that affect our
warranty liability include the number of installed units,
historical experience and management’s judgment regarding
anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We
assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities every
quarter and make adjustments to the liability if necessary.

On long-term contract sales in our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments, the value
or price of our warranty is generally included in the contract
and funded by the customer. A provision is built into the
estimated program costs when determining the profit rate to
accrue when applying the cost-to-cost percentage of completion
revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, if incurred, are
charged to the specific program’s cost and both revenue and
cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the
estimated program cost for warranty include terms of the
contract, number of installed units, historical experience and
management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
warranty claims and cost per claim.

See Note 10: Accrued Warranties for additional
information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation —

The functional currency for most
international subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange and
income and expense items are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Unearned Compensation —

Compensation resulting from
performance shares granted under our stock incentive plans is
amortized to expense over the performance period and is adjusted
for changes in the market value of our common stock.

Compensation resulting from restricted shares
granted under our stock incentive plan is amortized to expense
over the vesting period based on the price of our common stock
on the grant date.

Stock Options —

In accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” we use the intrinsic-value method of
accounting for stock option awards to employees and,
accordingly, do not recognize compensation expense for our stock
option awards to employees in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. See Note 15: Stock Options and Awards for additional
information regarding stock options including pro forma
information on the impact of the fair-value method of accounting
for stock options.

Revenue Recognition

Our segments have the following revenue
recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
segment:

Revenue in our Government
Communications Systems segment primarily relates to long-term
contracts. Revenue and anticipated profits under long-term
contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis,
generally using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where
sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs
incurred to estimated total costs at completion. Contracts are
combined when specific aggregation criteria stated in the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s
Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts” (“SOP 81-1”) are met. Criteria
generally include closely interrelated activities performed for
a single customer within the same economic environment.
Contracts generally are not segmented. If contracts are
segmented, they meet the segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.
Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered
in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, are
generally



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

not recognized until the event occurs. When
adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

RF Communications
segment:

Revenue in our RF
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above except that our
RF Communications segment sometimes uses the units of delivery
method of accounting rather than the cost-to-cost method of
accounting for production contracts that call for the delivery
of larger quantities of products. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Unearned income on service contracts is
amortized by the straight-line method over the term of the
contracts. This segment recognizes revenue when contractual
obligations related to customer acceptance of a product or
performance are satisfied.

Microwave Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Microwave
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered, from rentals as they
accrue and from services when performed. Long-term contract
sales follow the same policies as stated under our Government
Communications Systems segment’s revenue recognition policy
above. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by the
straight-line method over the term of the contracts. This
segment recognizes revenues when contractual obligations related
to customer acceptance of a product or performance are
satisfied. Further, if an arrangement other than a long-term
contract requires the delivery or performance of multiple
deliverables or elements, such as the sale of equipment and
installation, under a bundled sale, we determine whether the
individual elements represent “separate units of
accounting” under the requirements of Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue 00-21, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements” (“EITF 00-21”). If the separate
elements meet the requirements listed in EITF 00-21, we
recognize the revenue associated with each element separately.
If the elements within a bundled sale are not considered
separate units of accounting, the delivery of an individual
element is considered not to have occurred if there are
undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality.

Network Support
segment:

Revenue in our Network
Support segment primarily relates to product and services sales.
Revenue is recognized from sales when a product is delivered and
from services when performed. Unearned income on service
contracts is amortized by the straight-line method over the term
of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue when
contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
other than a long-term contract requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables or elements, such as the
sale of equipment and installation, under a bundled sale, we
determine whether the individual elements represent
“separate units of accounting” under the requirements
of EITF 00-21. If the separate elements meet the requirements
listed in EITF 00-21, we recognize the revenue associated with
each element separately. If the elements within a bundled sale
are not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of
an individual element is considered not to have occurred if
there are undelivered elements that are essential to the
functionality.

Broadcast Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Broadcast
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. Unearned income
on service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method
over the term of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue
when contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
other than a long-term contract requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables or elements, such as the
sale of equipment and installation, under a bundled sale, we
determine whether the individual elements represent
“separate units of accounting” under the requirements
of EITF 00-21. If the separate elements meet the requirements
listed in EITF 00-21, we recognize the revenue associated with
each element separately. If the elements within a bundled sale
are not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of
an individual element is considered not to have occurred if
there are undelivered elements that are essential to the
functionality.

Other:

Royalty
income is included as a component of “Non-operating
income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income and is
recognized on the basis of terms specified in contractual
agreements.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers
are classified on the Consolidated Statement of Income as
“Revenue from product sales and services” and the
associated costs are classified in “Cost of product sales
and services.”

Revenue from services was less than
10 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003, fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2001.

Retirement Benefits —

We provide retirement benefits to
substantially all employees primarily through a defined
contribution retirement plan having profit sharing, matching and
savings elements. Contributions by us to the retirement plan are
based on profits and employees’ savings with no other
funding requirements. We may make additional contributions to
the fund at our discretion.

Retirement benefits also include an unfunded
limited healthcare plan for U.S.-based retirees and employees on
long-term disability. We accrue the estimated cost of these
medical benefits, which are not material, during an
employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expense amounted to
$58.0 million in fiscal 2003, $46.1 million in fiscal 2002
and $30.9 million in fiscal 2001.

Environmental Expenditures —

We capitalize environmental
expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. We accrue
environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that
relate to past operations when the costs are probable and
reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party
at 14 sites where future liabilities could exist. These sites
include two sites owned by us, eight sites associated with our
former graphics or semiconductor locations and four treatment or
disposal sites not owned by us that contain hazardous substances
allegedly attributable to us from past operations. Four of the
eight sites associated with our former graphics or semiconductor
sites were sold to Intersil Corporation. Based on an assessment
of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
liability under the Superfund Act and other environmental
statutes and regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5
percent discount rate, is approximately $3.9 million. This
liability is accrued in the June 27, 2003 Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that
will be incurred over the next 20 to 25 years (depending on
the number of years for each site) is approximately
$6.4 million. The expected payments for the next five years
are: fiscal 2004 — $0.4 million; fiscal
2005 — $0.6 million; fiscal 2006 — $0.6
million; fiscal 2007 — $0.6 million; fiscal
2008 — $0.4 million; and the aggregate amount
thereafter is approximately $3.8 million.

Financial Guarantees —

Guarantees are contingent commitments
issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper
issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. The term of
the guarantee is equal to the remaining term of the related
debt, which ranges from one to three years. The maximum
potential amount of future payments we could be required to make
under our guarantees at June 27, 2003 is $1.9 million.
At June 27, 2003, there are no guarantees accrued for in
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also hold insurance policies
with third parties to mitigate the risk of loss on a portion of
these guarantees

.

Financial Instruments and Risk
Management —

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”), requires us to recognize all
derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.
Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative
are either offset against the change in fair value of assets,
liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized
in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a
combination of foreign currency call options and foreign
currency forward contracts to hedge against risks associated
with anticipated cash flows that are probable of occurring in
the future and cash flows that are fixed or firmly committed.
These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
used to hedge these cash flows. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

We account for our instruments used to hedge
against the currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated
with anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement 133, such financial instruments are marked-to-market
using forward prices and fair market value quotes with the
offset to other comprehensive income, net of hedge
ineffectiveness. The foreign currency call options and forward
contracts are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Cost of product sales and services” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income when the underlying net cash
flows are realized. The cashless collars for marketable
securities are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Non-operating income” on the Consolidated Statement
of Income when the underlying net cash flows are realized.
Unrealized losses are recorded in “Other accrued
items” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to
other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.
Unrealized gains are recorded as “Other assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to these financial
instruments, but we do not expect any of the counterparties to
fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, we
select counterparties based on credit ratings, limit our
exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines and
monitor the market position with each counterparty. In the event
of the termination of a derivative designated as a hedge, the
settlement would be charged to the Consolidated Statement of
Income as a component of “Non-operating income.”

Net Income Per Share —

Net income per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
year. See Note 16: Net Income Per Share for additional
information regarding net income per share.

Reclassifications —

Certain prior-year amounts have been
reclassified on the consolidated financial statements to conform
with current year classifications.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING
CHANGES

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“Statement 141”) and Statement
142. Statement 141 eliminates the pooling method of accounting
for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001
and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business
combination. We adopted this accounting standard for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

In accordance with Statement 142, we discontinued
the amortization of goodwill as of the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2002. A reconciliation of previously reported
net income and net income per common share to the amounts
adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization net of the
related income tax effect follows:

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“Statement
143”). Statement 143 establishes accounting standards for
the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement
obligation and its associated asset retirement cost. It also



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

provides accounting guidance for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. We have adopted the provisions of Statement
143 for fiscal 2003, which did not result in a material impact
to our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“Statement 144”). Statement 144 supersedes Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, but retains its
fundamental provisions for the (a) recognition and
measurement of impairment of long-lived assets to be held and
used, and (b) measurement of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. Statement 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 30 for segments of a business to be
disposed of, but retains the requirement to report discontinued
operations separately from continuing operations and extends
that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held for sale. We have adopted
the provisions of Statement 144 for fiscal 2003, which did not
result in a material impact to our financial position, cash
flows or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections”
(“Statement 145”). Statement 145 updates, clarifies
and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements. Statement 145
rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4
(“Statement 4”), which required all gains and losses
from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material,
classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax
effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30 will now be used to classify those gains and
losses because Statement 4 has been rescinded. Statement 145
amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic
effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions be accounted for
in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions. This
amendment is consistent with the FASB’s goal of requiring
similar accounting treatment for transactions that have similar
economic effects. Statement 145 also makes technical corrections
to existing pronouncements. While those corrections are not
substantive in nature, in some instances they may change
accounting practice. We have adopted the provisions of Statement
145 for fiscal 2003, which did not result in a material impact
to our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“Statement 146”). Statement 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” (“Issue 94-3”). The principal
difference between Statement 146 and Issue 94-3 relates to
Statement 146’s requirements for recognition of a liability
for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity.
Statement 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit
cost as generally defined in Issue 94-3 was recognized at the
date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. A
fundamental conclusion reached by the FASB in Statement 146 is
that an entity’s commitment to a plan, by itself, does not
create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability.
Therefore, Statement 146 eliminates the definition and
requirements for recognition of exit costs in Issue 94-3.
Statement 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective
for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of
Statement 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002. We have adopted the
provisions of Statement 146 for the quarter ending
March 28, 2003, which did not result in a material impact
to our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a
consensus on Issue 00-21, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements.” EITF 00-21 addresses how to account for
arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The
consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or
both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales
arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are
“separate units of accounting.” The guidance can
affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements,
even though it does not change rules governing the timing or
pattern of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for
separately. We have adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21
for the quarter ended March 28, 2003, which did not result
in a material impact to our financial position, cash flows or
results of operations.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

In November 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation Number 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure
requirements of FIN 45 were effective for interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 2002 and we have
adopted those requirements. We also have adopted the initial
recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45
prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002, which did not result in a material
impact to our financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a
consensus on Issue 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a
Vendor” (“EITF 02-16”). The consensus was
reached that cash consideration received by a customer from a
vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the
vendor’s products or services and should be treated as a
reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the
customer’s income statement. This presumption can be
overcome if the consideration can be shown to represent either a
payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor or a
reimbursement of costs incurred by the reseller to sell the
vendor’s products. The EITF also reached consensus on when
a customer should recognize a rebate or refund that is payable
only if the customer completes a specified level of purchases.
Recognition should occur when the rebate or refund is probable
or reasonably estimable and should be based on a systematic and
rational method. This consensus is to be applied to fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We already
account for such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales
when the vendor rebate is probable or reasonably estimable and
based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash
consideration to be received; therefore, EITF 02-16 has no
material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results
of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”
(“Statement 148”). Statement 148 amends Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“Statement 123”), and provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. Statement 148 also amends the disclosure
requirements of Statement 123 to require more prominent and
frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects
of stock-based compensation. The transition guidance and annual
disclosure provisions of Statement 148 are effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are
effective for financial reports containing financial statements
for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We
adopted the disclosure provisions of Statement 148 for our
financial statements in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 28, 2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation Number 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). This
interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities. Under current practice, two enterprises generally have
been included in consolidated financial statements because one
enterprise controls the other through voting interests.
FIN 46 defines the concept of “variable
interests” and requires existing unconsolidated variable
interest entities to be consolidated by their primary
beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks
among the parties involved. This interpretation applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable
interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable
interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. If it is
reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or
disclose information about a variable interest entity when
FIN 46 becomes effective, the enterprise shall disclose
information about those entities in all financial statements
issued after January 31, 2003. The interpretation may be
applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously
issued financial statements for one or more years with a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first
year restated. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a
material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results
of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, “Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“Statement 149”). Statement 149
amends and clarifies the definition of a derivative, expands the
nature of exemptions from Statement 133, clarifies the
application of hedge accounting when using certain instruments,
clarifies the application of Statement 133 to



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

embedded derivatives and modifies the cash flow
presentation of derivative instruments containing financing
elements. Statement 149 is effective for contracts entered into
or modified after June 30, 2003. We will adopt Statement
149 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. We do not
expect the adoption of Statement 149 to have a material
impact to our financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity” (“Statement 150”).
Statement 150 establishes standards on the classification and
measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity and requires certain financial
instruments that frequently are used in connection with share
repurchase programs to be classified as liabilities. Many of
these instruments previously were classified as equity or
temporary equity. Statement 150 became effective for public
companies for all financial instruments created or modified
after May 31, 2003, and to other instruments at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. We adopted Statement 150 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 with no impact to our financial position,
cash flows or results of operations.

In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 03-5, “Applicability of AICPA Statement of
Position 97-2 (“SOP 97-2”) to Non-Software
Deliverables” (“EITF 03-5”). The consensus was
reached that non-software deliverables are included within the
scope of SOP 97-2 if they are included in an arrangement
that contains software that is essential to the non-software
deliverables’ functionality. This consensus is to be
applied to fiscal periods beginning after August 13, 2003.
We do not expect the adoption of EITF 03-5 to have a
material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results
of operations.

NOTE 3: BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS

In August 2000, we purchased WavTrace, Inc.
(“WavTrace”), a developer of broadband wireless access
systems for high-speed wireless access to the Internet and other
data, voice and video services. This acquisition has been
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the results of operations of WavTrace have been
included in the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date
of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, we owned slightly less
than 20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase price for the
remaining approximately 80 percent is valued at
$144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as follows:

During fiscal 2003, the business responsibility,
project engineers, technology, products and goodwill previously
associated with WavTrace were transferred from our Microwave
Communications segment to our Government Communications Systems
segment.

The amount of consideration to the former
shareholders and option holders of WavTrace was determined by
arm’s-length negotiation between the parties and was paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The amount
allocated to purchased in-process research and development on
the WavTrace acquisition was $73.5 million. The purchased
in-process research and development expenses were determined
through established valuation techniques in the technology
communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed. Research and development
costs to bring the products from the acquired company to
technological feasibility did not have a material impact on our
results of operations or cash flows. The WavTrace acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $53.9 million.

In May 2001, we purchased Exigent
International, Inc. (“Exigent”), a software and
service provider for satellite command and control,
telecommunications and information technology, primarily for
U.S. Government markets. This acquisition has been
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

results of operations of Exigent have been
included in the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date
of acquisition. The purchase price of Exigent was
$34.7 million, which is calculated as follows:

Exigent is being operated within our Government
Communications Systems segment.

The amount of consideration to the former
shareholders and option holders of Exigent was determined by
arm’s-length negotiation between the parties and was paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The Exigent
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $19.7 million and other
identifiable intangible assets of $4.1 million. The other
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods between four and eight years.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma
basis, combines the consolidated results of operations as if
WavTrace and Exigent had been acquired as of the beginning of
the period presented, after including the impact of adjustments
such as: amortization of intangibles, decreased interest income
from the use of cash and cash equivalents, compensation expense
from converted options and the related income tax effects.

The pro forma results are not necessarily
indicative of what actually would have occurred had we acquired
WavTrace and Exigent for the entire period presented.

On June 30, 2001, which was in fiscal 2002,
we purchased the assets of Hirschmann Multimedia Communications
Network (“Hirschmann”). This acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
the results of operations of Hirschmann have been included in
the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date of
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effect of this acquisition was not
material. We paid cash in the net amount of $8.6 million
for Hirschmann. The Hirschmann acquisition resulted in goodwill
of $14.3 million. Hirschmann is being operated within our
Broadcast Communications segment.

NOTE 7: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for
the fiscal years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, by
business segment, are as follows:

We have other identifiable intangible assets
related primarily to technology acquired through acquisition.
These other identifiable intangible assets, included in
“Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were
$18.7 million at June 27, 2003 and $12.6 million at
June 28, 2002. Accumulated amortization related to other
identifiable intangibles was $5.8 million at June 27, 2003
and $4.0 million at June 28, 2002. Our other
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their
useful economic lives, which range from four years to
17 years. The weighted average useful life of our other
identifiable intangible assets is 13.6 years. Amortization
expense related to other identifiable intangible assets was
$1.8 million in fiscal 2003, $1.7 million



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

in fiscal 2002 and $0.8 million in fiscal
2001. The estimated amortization expense for the five fiscal
years following fiscal 2003 is: $2.5 million in fiscal 2004,
$2.4 million in fiscal 2005, $2.0 million in fiscal
2006, $1.6 million in fiscal 2007, $1.5 in fiscal 2008 and
$8.7 million thereafter.

NOTE 8: JOINT VENTURES

As of June 27, 2003 we did not have any
investments in joint ventures (less than 50% owned) accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. In June of 2001, we
sold our minority interest in our GE-Harris Railway Electronics,
LLC joint venture for $50.0 million cash, which resulted in
a pretax gain of $33.4 million. In August 2001, we
sold our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls
Systems, LLC joint venture for $23.0 million cash, which
resulted in a pretax gain of $10.3 million. In
September 2002 we sold our minority interest in our LiveTV,
LLC venture for $19.0 million cash, which resulted in a
pretax gain of $18.8 million. Condensed balance sheets as
of June 28, 2002, and condensed statements of income for
fiscal years 2002 and 2001 for these joint ventures follows:

Ventures

NOTE 9: SELECTED
INVESTMENTS

We have equity investments in technology
companies, which are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting. These investments are included in the “Other
assets” caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These
selected investments are summarized below:

The investment in Teltronics, Inc.
(“Teltronics”) is Series C Preferred Stock, which
is convertible into Teltronics’ common stock. In no case
will this Series C Preferred Stock be exercisable for more
than 19.9 percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Teltronics’ capital stock that is entitled to
vote. In addition to the equity investments noted above we also
have notes receivable from Terion, Inc. (“Terion”) and
Teltronics of $6.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively.

Terion is a privately held company that is a
wireless data communication and information solution provider
for mobile and remote business-to-business applications focusing
on the transportation industry. It has sold units to customers
such as J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and XTRA Lease, a
division of XTRA Corporation. None of Terion’s revenue is
generated from Harris or its affiliates. We have invested
technology and cash in Terion since fiscal 1994 and we currently
occupy one of Terion’s five board of director seats. The
maximum exposure to loss we have with our interest in Terion is
$28.6 million.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

AuthenTec, Inc. (“AuthenTec”) is a
privately held company that provides advanced biometric
fingerprint sensors to the PC, wireless, PDA, access control and
automotive markets. AuthenTec has shipped over one million of
its TruePrint® technology-based sensors to several
customers in a multitude of countries worldwide.
AuthenTec’s revenues generated from Harris or its
affiliates have not been material. We have invested technology
and cash in AuthenTec since 1998 and none of our current
employees sit on AuthenTec’s board of directors. The
maximum exposure to loss we have with our interest in AuthenTec
is $15.8 million.

Teltronics is a publicly held company that is
traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol
“TELT.” Teltronics is a global provider of
communications solutions with revenues of $54.4 million in
calendar 2002. Teltronics’ revenues generated from Harris
or its affiliates have not been material. On June 30, 2000
we sold certain equipment, inventory and intellectual property
rights related to our 20-20® switching technology and
associated products from our telecom switch business to
Teltronics in exchange for a promissory note, a portion of which
was converted to Series C Preferred Stock in March 2002
under a Master Restructuring Agreement. None of our current
employees sit on Teltronics’ board of directors. The
maximum exposure to loss we have with our interest in Teltronics
is $10.1 million.

We have reviewed whether the requirements of
FIN 46 will have a material impact on our financial
position, cash flows or results of operations due to our
variable interests in these selected investments. Based on that
review, we do not believe that the requirements of FIN 46 will
have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows or
results of operations.

NOTE 10: ACCRUED
WARRANTIES

Changes in our warranty liability, which is
included as a component of “Other accrued items” on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, during fiscal 2003 are as
follows:

NOTE 11: CREDIT
ARRANGEMENTS

We have available a committed syndicated credit
facility with various banks that currently provides for
borrowings up to $212.5 million under a 3-Year Credit
Agreement, which expires in May 2004. Interest rates on
borrowings under this facility and related fees are determined
by a pricing matrix based upon our long-term debt rating
assigned by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and
Moody’s Investors Service. The availability of this
facility is not contingent upon our debt rating. We are not
required to maintain compensating balances in connection with
this agreement. At June 27, 2003, no amounts were borrowed
under this facility, but availability of borrowings under this
facility does enable us to issue commercial paper. The financial
covenants contained in this facility include, among others,
maintenance of consolidated tangible net worth of not less than
$813.2 million (which amount was initially
$700 million and is subject to further increase),
maintenance of a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ratio of not more than 3.0 and a
limit on total debt to $800 million. This credit facility
also includes negative covenants (i) limiting the creation
of liens or other encumbrances, (ii) limiting certain sale
and leaseback transactions, and (iii) limiting certain sales or
other dispositions of assets other than in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, this facility includes certain
provisions for acceleration of maturity in the case of a (a)
“cross default” with other indebtedness in an amount
in excess of $25 million, (b) final uninsured judgment
in excess of $25 million which remains unpaid or
discharged, or (c) change of control, including if a person
or group of persons acquires more than 25 percent of our
voting stock.

We have an effective shelf registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
provides for the issuance of debt securities of up to
$500 million.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit
aggregating $54.8 million from various U.S. and
international banks, of which $23.6 million was available
on June 27, 2003. These lines provide for borrowings at
various interest rates, typically may be terminated upon notice,
may be used on such terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and
us and are reviewed annually for renewal or modification. We
have a short-term commercial paper program in place, which we
may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. There were
no borrowings under the commercial paper program at
June 27, 2003. These lines do not require compensating
balances.

NOTE 12: SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $31.2 million at
June 27, 2003 and $24.6 million at June 28, 2002
is entirely made up of notes payable to banks in both years.
Bank notes with Brazilian banks amounted to $4.5 million at
June 27, 2003 with a weighted-average interest rate of
24.3 percent and $11.4 million at June 28, 2002
with a weighted-average interest rate of 19.2 percent. The
weighted-average interest rate for bank notes other than those
with Brazilian banks was 4.0 percent at June 27, 2003
and 4.3 percent at June 28, 2002.

NOTE 13: LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt includes the following:

The weighted-average interest rate for other
long-term debt to banks was 3.0 percent at June 28,
2002. The other long-term debt to banks at June 27, 2003,
was interest free. Maturities of long-term debt, including the
current portion, for the five years following fiscal 2003 are:
$0.8 million in fiscal 2004, $0.2 million in fiscal
2005, none in fiscal 2006, $1.4 million in fiscal 2007,
$150.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $250.0 million
thereafter.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. The debentures are unsecured obligations
convertible, in certain instances, into shares of our common
stock at an initial conversion price of $45.25 per share,
subject to adjustment. The debentures were issued at
100 percent of the principal amount, less a discount of
2.5 percent to the initial purchasers. We may redeem the
debentures commencing August 2007 at 100 percent of
the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may require
us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in part, on
specified dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017 or upon the occurrence of
certain other events at 100 percent of the principal amount
plus accrued interest. The debentures bear interest at an annual
rate of 3.5 percent. The interest rate will be reset in
August 2007, 2012 and 2017, but in no event will it be
reset below 3.5 percent or above 5.5 percent per
annum. We incurred $4.8 million in debt issuance costs related
to the issuance of the convertible debentures, which costs are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period
and reflected as a portion of interest expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

NOTE 14: PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE
RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, we declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share
of common stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by the common stock share certificates,
trade with the common stock until they become exercisable, and
entitle the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
Participating Preferred Stock for $125, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of 10 business
days (or such later date fixed by the Board) after a party
commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire a beneficial
interest of at least 15 percent of our outstanding



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

common stock, or the first date of public
announcement by us that a person has acquired a beneficial
interest of at least 15 percent of our outstanding common
stock, or such later date fixed by our Board of Directors.

Upon the first date of public announcement by us
that a person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding common stock, or such later
date fixed by our Board of Directors, each right (other than
rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any
affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the holder to
purchase shares of our common stock having a market value equal
to twice the exercise price of the right. In addition, each
right (other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring
person or any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the
holder to exercise the right and receive shares of common stock
of the acquiring company, upon a merger or other business
combination, having a market value of twice the exercise price
of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights
become exercisable, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange
all of the then outstanding rights for shares of common stock at
an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right,
subject to adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and
may be redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $.01 per
right at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial
ownership of 15 percent of the outstanding common stock.

NOTE 15: STOCK OPTIONS AND
AWARDS

The following information relates to stock option
and incentive stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent
of market value on the date the options are granted. Option
grants are for a maximum of 10 years after dates of grant
and may be exercised in installments.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, we
use the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option
awards granted to employees and, accordingly, do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
the Consolidated Statement of Income. This footnote includes pro
forma information on the impact of the fair-value method of
accounting for stock options.

Price ranges of outstanding and exercisable
options at June 27, 2003 are summarized below:



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of Statement 123 to all previously
granted stock-based awards after giving consideration to
potential forfeitures. The estimated fair value of options
granted is amortized to expense over their vesting period, which
is generally three years.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value of options at
their grant date during fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal
2001, where the exercise price equaled the market price on the
grant date, was $9.69, $9.66 and $9.41, respectively.

We have stock incentive plans for directors and
employees. Awards under these plans may include the grant of
performance shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock
appreciation rights or other stock-based awards. Restricted
shares outstanding under the stock incentive plan were 125,000
at June 27, 2003 and none at June 28, 2002 and
June 29, 2001. Performance shares outstanding under the
stock incentive plans were 169,833 at June 27, 2003,
167,000 at June 28, 2002 and 139,342 at June 29, 2001.
Shares of common stock reserved for future awards under the
stock incentive plan were 7,613,616 at June 27, 2003,
8,503,111 at June 28, 2002 and 9,534,413 at June 30,
2001.

The weighted average fair values of restricted
and performance shares at their grant date during fiscal 2003,
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, were $31.81, $29.80 and $27.83,
respectively.

Total compensation expense recognized from
restricted and performance shares during fiscal 2003, fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2001 was $2.5 million, $3.6 million and
$1.1 million, respectively.

Under our domestic retirement plan, employees may
purchase a limited amount of our common stock at 70 percent
of current market value. The discounts from fair market value on
common stock purchased by employees under the domestic
retirement plans are charged to compensation expense in the
period of the related purchase.

NOTE 16: NET INCOME PER
SHARE

Average outstanding shares used in the
computation of net income per share are summarized below:

NOTE 17: RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs were
$99.6 million in fiscal 2003, $103.9 million in fiscal
2002 and $113.8 million in fiscal 2001.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs
are incurred pursuant to long-term contractual arrangements and
are accounted for principally by the percentage-of-completion
method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require
us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined
performance or other specifications (such as designs).
Customer-sponsored research and development costs were
$499.9 million in fiscal 2003, $412.3 million in
fiscal 2002 and $372.5 million in fiscal 2001.

NOTE 18: INTEREST
EXPENSE

Total interest was $24.9 million in fiscal
2003, $26.7 million in fiscal 2002 and $34.8 million
in fiscal 2001. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
major long-term construction projects can be capitalized as an
additional cost of the related asset. No interest was
capitalized in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2001. Interest
paid was $23.7 million in fiscal 2003, $29.4 million
in fiscal 2002 and $35.3 million in fiscal 2001.

NOTE 19: LEASE
COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to
$20.6 million in fiscal 2003, $22.3 million in fiscal 2002
and $20.9 million in fiscal 2001. Future minimum rental
commitments under leases, primarily for land and buildings,
amounted to approximately $68.7 million at June 27,
2003. These commitments for the years following fiscal 2003 are:
fiscal 2004 — $17.8 million; fiscal
2005 — $15.5 million; fiscal 2006 —
$10.4 million; fiscal 2007 — $9.0 million;
fiscal 2008 — $6.7 million; and $9.3 million
thereafter.

NOTE 20: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Foreign Exchange and
Currency:

We use foreign exchange
contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and future
foreign currency commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange
contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and
purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable from
and future committed sales to customers and intercompany loans.
We believe the use of foreign currency financial instruments
should reduce the risks that arise from doing business in
international markets. At June 27, 2003, we had open
foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
$95.7 million, of which $18.1 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $77.6 million were classified as
fair value hedges. This compares to total foreign exchange
contracts with a notional amount of $83.5 million as of
June 28, 2002, of which $44.8 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $38.7 million were classified as
fair value hedges. At June 27, 2003, contract expiration
dates range from less than one month to two years with a
weighted average contract life of 0.3 years.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the United
Kingdom Bowman Programme in our RF Communications segment. This
contract for our tactical radio products was awarded in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer
pays in Pounds Sterling (“GBP”). We also have payments
to local suppliers in GBP on this program. We have hedged the
forecasted sales and vendor payments denominated in GBP to
maintain our anticipated profit margin in U.S. dollars. As of
June 27, 2003, we estimated that a pretax loss of
$0.1 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next two years related to these
transactions.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal
2003 and 2002 representing the amount of fair value and cash
flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was $0.2 million and
$0.7 million, respectively. No amounts were recognized in
our earnings in fiscal 2003 and 2002 related to the component of
the derivatives instruments’ gain or loss excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were
recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2003 and 2002 related to
hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
value on the balance sheet in accordance with Statement 133.

Marketable
Securities:

We utilize option
contracts from time to time in the form of cashless collars to
hedge anticipated cash flows from the sale of marketable
securities. Contracts are generally one year or less. At
June 27, 2003, we had no open option contracts, which
compares to open option contracts for 175,000 shares of Intersil
Corporation stock at a weighted average strike price of $32.26
as of June 28, 2002. These collars were classified as cash
flow hedges and recorded at their fair value on the balance
sheet in accordance with Statement 133. The fair market value of
these collars reflected in the caption “Other assets”
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 28, 2002 was $1.9
million.

tax liability for the undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries is not practicable.

dates ranging between 1 and 19 years.

Pretax income (loss) of international
subsidiaries was $(23.9) million in fiscal 2003,
$1.2 million in fiscal 2002 and $4.5 million in fiscal
2001.

Income taxes paid were $23.0 million in
fiscal 2003, $20.7 million in fiscal 2002 and
$33.7 million in fiscal 2001.

The valuation allowance increased
$13.6 million from $6.5 million in fiscal 2002 to
$20.1 million in fiscal 2003. The valuation allowance has
been established for financial reporting purposes, to offset
certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due to
uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the future.

NOTE 23: BUSINESS
SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we
serve and operate in five business segments —
Government Communications Systems, RF Communications,
Microwave Communications, Network Support and Broadcast
Communications. Our Government Communications Systems segment
engages in advanced research and develops, designs and produces
advanced communication and information processing systems. Our
RF Communications segment performs advanced research and
develops, designs, manufactures and sells secure tactical radio
products and provides services related to secure tactical radio
products. Our Microwave Communications segment designs,
manufactures and sells microwave radio products and provides
services related to microwave radio products. Our Network
Support segment designs, manufactures and sells telephone test
equipment and systems; develops, designs, produces and sells
network management systems; and provides services related to
these products and systems. Our Broadcast Communications segment
designs, manufactures and sells television and radio
transmission products; develops, designs, produces and sells
automation and control systems and studio products; and provides
services related to these products and systems.

Our products and systems are produced principally
in the United States with international revenues derived
primarily from exports. No revenues earned from any individual
foreign country exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue
during fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2001.

The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in Note 1: Significant
Accounting Policies. We evaluate each segment’s performance
based on its “operating income or loss,” which we
define as profit or loss from operations before income taxes
excluding interest income and expense, equity income, goodwill
amortization and gains or losses from securities and other
investments. Intersegment sales, which are disclosed below as
“corporate eliminations,” are accounted for at prices
comparable to those provided to unaffiliated customers.
“Corporate eliminations” represent the elimination of
intersegment sales. “Headquarters expense” represents
the portion of corporate expenses not allocated to the business
segments.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all segments
(primarily our Government Communications Systems segment and to
a lesser extent our RF Communications segment) as a percent of
total revenues were 61.5 percent in fiscal 2003,
54.0 percent in fiscal 2002 and 41.8 percent in fiscal
2001.

Selected information by business segment and
geographical area is summarized below:

NOTE 24: LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, as a normal incident of the
nature and kind of businesses in which we are engaged, various
claims or charges are asserted and litigation commenced against
us arising from or related to: product liability; patents,
trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes; the
sale or use of products containing asbestos; breach of warranty;
antitrust; distribution; or contractual relations. Claimed
amounts may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable
relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any
real risk of court awards. While it is not feasible to predict
the outcome of these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be disposed or decided unfavorably to
us, based upon available information, in the opinion of
management, settlements and final judgments, if any, which might
be rendered against us in existing litigation are reserved
against, covered by insurance or would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or our business taken
as a whole.

In April 2002, 43 plaintiffs filed suit
against 23 defendants, including us, in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the
“Schwinger” matter). The complaint seeks redress for
injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of defendants
allegedly emitting toxins into the environment located in and
near Hicksville, New York. Five related defendants are
classified as “Verizon” defendants and are alleged to
have released radioactive and toxic materials. The remaining
defendants, including us, have been accused of releasing
non-radioactive materials. The plaintiffs claimed damages that
exceeded $360 million. In September 2002, we received
an amended complaint, which added approximately 141 plaintiffs,
bringing the number of plaintiffs to 184. The claim for damages
in the amended complaint appeared to double from the original
complaint. In December 2002, the judge presiding over the
Schwinger matter administratively dismissed the action and
required the plaintiffs to refile their claims through three
nominative plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs will be required to show
how we and the other named defendants caused their losses before
the remaining plaintiffs are allowed to proceed. We have been
served with that refiled complaint which includes claims for
compensatory and punitive damages. We also were served with a
related complaint by a single plaintiff (the “Astuto”
matter) who alleges losses similar to the three plaintiffs in
the Schwinger matter but makes no monetary demand. The plaintiff
in the Astuto matter will be required to show how we and the
other named defendants caused certain losses before eight other
plaintiffs are able to join in that action. We also have been
served with a complaint in a third related matter (the
“Bennet” matter), where 44 plaintiffs are alleging
claims similar to those brought by the Schwinger and Astuto
plaintiffs against a similar group of defendants, including us.
The Bennet plaintiffs are claiming $135 million in damages.
Proceedings in the Bennet matter have been stayed pending the
outcome of the Schwinger and Astuto matters. We believe that our
liability in these related matters, if any, is not significant.
We anticipate filing appropriate motions in each case and intend
to vigorously defend each action.

We previously filed a patent infringement claim
against Ericsson, Inc. in the United States Federal District
Court for the Northern District of Texas. On October 29,
2002, a jury rendered a verdict in our favor against Ericsson,
Inc. and its parent company. The jury awarded us approximately
$61 million in compensatory damages and found that
Ericsson’s conduct was “willful.” Following the
rendering of such verdict, we filed a motion to treble the
damages and Ericsson filed motions (i) to decrease the
damage award, (ii) to order a new trial, and (iii) for
non-infringement and invalidity of the patent notwithstanding
the jury’s verdict. On July 17, 2003, the Court issued
a ruling on these motions denying Ericsson’s motions for
non-infringement and invalidity of the patent, but did rule that
unless we agreed to a lowered damage award of $43 million
in compensatory damages within 30 days, it was granting
Ericsson’s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages.
Harris has agreed to the lowered damages and thus, a judgment
was entered for Harris in the amount of $43 million plus
$1 million for enhanced damages and $1 million for
attorneys’ fees, as well as pre-judgment interest, which we
currently estimate to be approximately $8 million. The
judgment is subject to appeal. Furthermore, since the amount of
damages, if any, which we may receive cannot be quantified until
the legal process is complete, no gain has been recorded in our
Consolidated Statement of Income related to this matter.
