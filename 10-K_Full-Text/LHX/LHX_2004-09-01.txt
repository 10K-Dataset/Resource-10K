PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, along with its subsidiaries,
is an international communications technology company focused on
providing assured communications products, systems and services
for government and commercial customers. Our operating divisions
serve markets for government communications, secure tactical
radio, microwave and broadcast systems.

Harris was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as
the successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our
principal executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA
Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is
(321) 727-9100. Our common stock is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol “HRS.” On
August 20, 2004, we employed about 12,000 people. We sell
products in more than 150 countries. Unless the context
otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
“us,” “Company,” and “Harris” as
used in this Annual Report refer to Harris and its subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations around the following
four business segments: (1) Government Communications
Systems, (2) RF Communications, (3) Microwave
Communications, and (4) Broadcast Communications. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, in conjunction with the sale of
our telecom tools and test systems (“TTS”) product
line, we changed our segment reporting structure by eliminating
the Network Support segment as a separate reportable segment.
The TTS product line is reported as a discontinued operation,
and the NetBoss® network operations software business,
which was part of the Network Support segment, has been
consolidated into the Microwave Communications segment. Segment
information for all periods presented has been reclassified to
reflect the new segment reporting structure. Unless otherwise
noted, disclosures in this Annual Report relate only to our
continuing operations. Financial information with respect to all
of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated
to the operating segments or discontinued operations, is
reported as part of Headquarters Expense or Non-Operating Income
(Loss).

Each of our business segments, which are also
referred to by us as “divisions,” has been organized
on the basis of specific communications markets. For the most
part, each operating segment has its own marketing, engineering,
manufacturing and product service and maintenance organization.
We produce most of the products we sell.

Our total revenues in fiscal 2004 were
approximately $2.52 billion compared to approximately
$2.06 billion a year earlier. Total revenues in the United
States increased approximately 23 percent from a year
earlier while international revenues, which amounted to
approximately 20 percent of our total revenues in fiscal
2004,



increased approximately 20 percent. Our net
income from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was
$125.7 million compared to $70.3 million in fiscal
2003.

U.S. Census Bureau, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(“NGA”), Department of State, U.S. Postal Service
and other U.S. Government agencies, and also for other
large aerospace and defense companies. The Government
Communications Systems segment serves five strategic program
areas.

Department of Defense
Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a major supplier of spaceborne communications and
information processing systems, including large deployable
satellite antenna systems, and flat-panel, phased-array and
single-mission antennas. Harris is a leading supplier of
high-frequency satellite ground terminals for the
U.S. Department of Defense, supplying the Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marines. Currently in the design phase is the
U.S. Air Force’s Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight

Joint Strike Fighter program through 2023. The Government
Communications Systems segment also provides tactical common
data links providing high-speed digital data links to support
both unmanned and manned airborne reconnaissance platforms.

National Security
Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a leading provider of communications equipment and
systems, and image and information processing solutions to
national intelligence customers. We provide comprehensive
solutions for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. A
significant portion of this program area involves classified
programs. While classified programs are not discussed in this
Annual Report, the operating results relating to classified
programs are included in our consolidated financial statements,
and the business risks associated with such programs do not
differ materially from those of other programs for the
U.S. Government. Under many of our programs, we are
required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances
complying with U.S. Department of Defense and other Federal
agency requirements.



Civil Programs:

Government Communications Systems is a leading supplier to
civilian agencies of the U.S. Government supplying custom
systems and software designed to collect, store, retrieve,
process, analyze, interpret, display and distribute information,
including meteorological data processing systems and range
management information systems. Government Communications
Systems is assisting the FAA in modernizing the U.S. air
traffic control system and infrastructure. We are the prime
contractor on a 15-year, $1.9 billion contract to integrate
and modernize the FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure
(“FTI”). The total contract amount for the FTI
program, including options, could reach $3.5 billion
through 2017. This program will consolidate telecommunications
at more than 5,000 FAA facilities nationwide, while reducing
operating costs, enhancing network security and improving
service. We are also working with the FAA on other programs,
including the Voice Switching and Control System program, which
provides critical air-to-ground communications links between
en-route air traffic controllers throughout the United States,
and the Operational and Supportability Implementation System
program to modernize the FAA’s Automated Flight Service
Stations, which provide flight planning and weather information
to general aviation pilots nationwide. Government Communications
Systems is the prime contractor for the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Master Address File/ Topologically Integrated
Geographic Encoding and Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project
(“MAF/ TIGER”). Currently anticipated to provide total
revenue of $200 million over an eight-year period ending in
2010, the MAF/ TIGER program will provide a computer database of
all addresses and locations where people live or work, covering
an estimated 115 million residences and 60 million
businesses in the U.S. During fiscal 2004, Government
Communications Systems, together with Broadcast Communications,
was awarded a one-year, $96 million contract to rebuild the
Iraqi Media Network (“IMN”). IMN is bringing modern
radio, TV broadcast and newspaper infrastructure and media
content to the people of Iraq. Government Communications System
is also supplying geospatial and imagery-derived products for
the NGA under the Global Geospatial Intelligence

AFB, Colorado, and Onizuka AFS, California. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, Harris completed the acquisition of The
Orkand Corporation, a privately-held, leading provider of
technical services and information technology for U.S.
Government agencies, including the Department of State,
Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of
Health and Human Services, Department of Energy and the U.S.
Postal Service. The acquisition of The Orkand Corporation is
expected to provide insight into additional opportunities with
these new customers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we
were selected by the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office
(“NRO”) to provide operations, maintenance and support
services for the agency’s global communications and
information systems. This program has a potential value of
$1 billion over ten years.

Homeland Security
Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is also focused on Homeland Security programs. As a
leader in communications, information processing, network
systems and surveillance, Harris has the capabilities to support
emerging Homeland Security programs.

Revenues, Backlog and
Contracts:

Revenues in fiscal 2004 for
the Government Communications Systems segment increased
32 percent to $1,506 million from $1,137 million
in fiscal 2003. Segment operating income increased
46 percent to $153 million from $105 million in
fiscal 2003. This segment contributed 60 percent of our
total revenues in fiscal 2004, 55 percent in fiscal 2003
and 50 percent in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004,
approximately 30 percent of the revenues for this segment
were under contracts with prime contractors and approximately
70 percent were direct with customers. Some of the
Government Communications Systems segment’s significant
programs by revenue in fiscal 2004 included Joint Strike
Fighter, MCOM, FTI, GMD, IMN, F/ A-22 Raptor, FAB-T, MAF/ TIGER,
AEHF, F/ A-18 E/ F Super Hornet and several classified programs.
The largest program by revenue represented approximately
5 percent of this segment’s revenues for fiscal 2004
and fiscal 2003. The 10 largest programs by revenue
represented approximately 30 percent of this segment’s
revenues in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. This segment currently
has a diverse portfolio of approximately 250 programs, each
having a value over $1 million. In fiscal 2004,
U.S. Government customers, whether directly or through
prime contractors, accounted for approximately 93 percent
of this segment’s total revenues.



The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this
segment of our business was $463 million at July 30,
2004, compared with $389 million a year earlier.
Substantially all this backlog is expected to be filled during
the 2005 fiscal year.

Most of the sales of the Government
Communications Systems segment are made directly or indirectly
to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
containing standard government contract clauses providing for
redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
of the contractor. This segment’s contracts include both
cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement
contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus
the payment of a fee. These contracts fall into three basic
types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for
the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of
performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which
provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified
limits, based upon actual results compared to contractual
targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and
delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts,
which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
contractor against pre-established criteria. Under
cost-reimbursement contracts, this segment is reimbursed
periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the
fee based on contract progress.

This segment’s fixed-price contracts are
either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive
contracts. Under firm fixed-price contracts, this segment agrees
to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and as a
result, benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of
cost overruns. Under fixed-price incentive contracts, this
segment shares with the U.S. Government both savings
accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs as
well as costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated
ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), but
carries the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated
ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts,
profit may also be adjusted up or down depending upon whether
specified performance objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price
and fixed-price incentive contracts, this segment usually
receives either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of
the contract price or monthly progress payments from the
U.S. Government in amounts equaling 75 percent of
costs incurred under U.S. Government contracts. The
remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are
billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and
deliverables under the contract. Fixed-price contracts generally
have higher profit margins than cost-reimbursement contracts.
Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and
development contracts are generally cost-reimbursement
contracts. For fiscal 2004, 68 percent of the revenues of
this segment were generated from cost-reimbursement contracts
and 32 percent were generated from fixed-price contracts.
For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, see
“Business — Principal Customers,”
“Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

RF Communications

of the Bowman contract with General Dynamics United Kingdom
Limited, valued at approximately $245 million, this segment
is expected to provide upwards of 10,000 high-frequency radio
units over the course of the five-year program. Production for
Bowman began in fiscal 2003. Under the JTRS program, the U.S.
Department of Defense is developing a family of software
programmable radios that share a common digital architecture
that can be applied to multiple platforms and support multiple
radio waveforms. This segment won a key position on the JTRS
program during fiscal 2002 and is providing system design,
development and production work for the first
“Cluster” of a five-cluster development program that
will provide advanced radio communications for all U.S. military
forces. Cluster 1 will modernize the vehicular and rotary
aircraft communications systems. The RF Communications segment
was also selected to incorporate its Sierra

TM

-based
cryptographic subsystems into all radios to be manufactured
under Cluster 1. The anticipated revenue from Cluster 1 of the
JTRS program could be as much as $600 million through full
production over 15 years.

Revenues in fiscal 2004 for the RF Communications
segment increased 32 percent over fiscal 2003 to
$430 million from $326 million. Segment operating
income increased 41 percent to $119 million in fiscal
2004 compared to $84 million in fiscal 2003. The RF
Communications segment contributed 17 percent of our total
revenues in fiscal 2004, 16 percent in fiscal 2003 and
14 percent in fiscal 2002. Approximately 47 percent of
the sales of this segment were made outside of the United States
in fiscal 2004. A significant portion of these sales were made
to NATO and Partnership for Peace customers.

In general, this segment’s domestic products
are sold and serviced directly to customers through its sales
organizations and through established distribution channels.
Internationally, this segment markets and sells its products and
services through regional sales offices and established
distribution channels. See “Business —

well as the first commercial digital television application and
is the market leader with respect to the U.S. digital standard
known as “ATSC.” This segment is the industry’s
leader in providing digital equipment to over-the-air
broadcasters and is also expanding its efforts in the digital
radio area and is developing the next wave of radio broadcasting
equipment, including systems for digital high definition radio
(HD Radio

TM

) and Digital Audio Broadcast and Digital
Radio Mondiale international standards. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, this segment received an order from
Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio broadcaster in
the U.S., for 17 HD Radio

TM

transmitters. Clear
Channel also announced that it plans to roll out digital
broadcasting equipment to 1,000 of its radio stations over the
next 3 years.

Broadcast Communications has provided digital
television transmitters to many U.S. broadcasters as they comply
with the U.S. Government-mandated transition from analog to
digital television transmission. In connection with the
transition of broadcasting from analog to digital technologies
and the trend toward centralized operations, broadcasters have
more opportunities to expand channel and service offerings and
for automation of many processes. This segment is a leading
supplier of automation solutions for broadcasters. This
segment’s automation product offerings include master
control-play-out systems for single-and multi-channel
applications, wide-area automation solutions, media asset
management systems, program management services and related
support and training.

Revenues for the Broadcast Communications segment
decreased 9 percent from $315 million in fiscal 2003
to $287 million in fiscal 2004. Segment operating income
was $8.1 million in fiscal 2004 and $8.0 million in
fiscal 2003. The Broadcast Communications segment contributed
11 percent of our total revenues in fiscal 2004,
15 percent in fiscal 2003 and 19 percent in fiscal
2002. The Broadcast Communications segment is North
America’s largest supplier of radio and television
broadcast equipment. Approximately 39 percent of the sales
of this segment were made outside of the United States in fiscal
2004.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Broadcast Communications segment decided to exit its
unprofitable TV systems integration business, which contributed
approximately $13 million in revenue in fiscal 2004.

In general, the segment’s domestic products
are sold and serviced directly to customers through its sales
organizations and through established distribution channels.
Internationally, this segment markets and sells its products and
services through regional sales offices and established
distribution channels. See “Business —
International Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment
of our business was $105 million at July 30, 2004, compared
with $93 million a year earlier. Substantially all of this
backlog is expected to be filled during the 2005 fiscal year.

International Business

Revenues in fiscal 2004 from products exported
from the United States (including foreign military sales) or
manufactured abroad were $507.5 million (20 percent of
our total revenues), compared with $422.8 million
(21 percent of our total revenues) in fiscal 2003 and
$411.5 million (22 percent of our total revenues) in
fiscal 2002. Our international sales include both direct exports
from the United States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Most
of the international sales are derived from the Microwave
Communications, RF Communications and Broadcast Communications
segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S.
dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally
denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Exports
from the United States, principally to Europe, Africa, the
Middle East and Asia, totaled $308.6 million
(61 percent of our international sales) in fiscal 2004,
$222.7 million (53 percent of our international sales)
in fiscal 2003 and $179.9 million (44 percent of our
international sales) in fiscal 2002.



Foreign operations represented 8 percent of
revenues in fiscal 2004, 10 percent of revenues in fiscal
2003 and 13 percent of revenues in fiscal 2002; and 16
percent of long-lived assets as of July 2, 2004 and
14 percent of long-lived assets as of June 27, 2003.

Principal international manufacturing facilities
are located in Canada, China and the United Kingdom.
International marketing activities are conducted through
subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
America and Asia. We have also established international
marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
Registrant” for further information regarding our foreign
subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including
dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the
marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both
domestically and internationally. These independent
representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit
orders from commercial or governmental customers for direct
sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances
may be recommended or established by the independent
representative and may be on a basis which is above or below our
list prices. These independent representatives generally receive
a discount from our list prices and may mark-up those prices in
setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. During
fiscal 2004, revenues from indirect sales channels represented
6 percent of our total revenues and 30 percent of our
international revenues, compared to revenues from indirect sales
channels in fiscal 2003 representing 8 percent of our total
revenues and 35 percent of our international revenues.

Fiscal 2004 revenues came from a large number of
foreign countries, no one of which accounted for 5 percent
or more of our total revenues. Certain of our exports are paid
for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either on an
open account or installment note basis. Advance payments,
progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or
upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
Performance guarantees by us are generally required on
significant foreign government contracts. In order to stay
competitive in international markets, we also enter into
recourse and vendor financing to facilitate sales to certain
customers.

The particular economic, social and political
conditions for business conducted outside the U.S. differ from
those encountered by domestic businesses. Our management
believes that the overall business risk for the international
business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by its
domestic operations as a whole. A description of the types of
risks to which we are subject in international business is
contained in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
offset by the diversification of the international business and
the protection provided by letters of credit and advance
payments. Financial information regarding our domestic and
international operations is contained in

Note 23: Business
Segments

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are
sensitive to technological advances. Although successful product
and systems development is not necessarily dependent on
substantial financial resources, some of our competitors in each
of our businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher
levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of
our businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that
our management believes are compatible with our resources,
overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal
competitive factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness,
product quality and reliability, technological capabilities,
service, ability to meet delivery schedules and the
effectiveness of dealers in international areas.

In the Government Communications Systems segment
principal competitors include: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General
Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, L-3 Communications, ITT
Industries, Computer Sciences and SAIC. The on-going
consolidation of the U.S. and global defense, space and
aerospace and related industries continues to intensify
competition. Consolidation among U.S. defense and aerospace
companies has resulted in a reduction in the number of principal
prime contractors. As a result of this consolidation, we
frequently “partner” with companies which are, from
time to time, competitors on other programs.

In the RF Communications segment competitors
include: Thales, General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Raytheon,
Rhode & Schwarz, and Tadiran.

In the Microwave Communications segment
competitors include: Alcatel, Stratex Networks, Ericsson, NEC,
Nera, Siemens, Nokia, Fujitsu, as well as other companies which
are in the development stage. Several of our competitors are
original equipment manufacturers through which we sometimes
distribute and sell products and services to end-users.



In the Broadcast Communications segment
competitors include: Broadcast Electronics, Encoda Systems, NEC,
Rhode & Schwarz, Thales, as well as other private companies
and divisions of large companies.

Principal Customers

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only
customer accounting for 2 percent or more of total
revenues, were 66 percent, 62 percent and 55 percent
of our total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
to, the U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as
for default. Companies engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government are dependent on Congressional
appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be
affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from
various military and political developments. Long-term
government contracts and related orders are subject to
cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance
periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable at the
convenience of the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to
receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted and
may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of
reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In
many cases, there is also additional uncertainty relating to the
complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. For
further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government
contracts, see “Legal Proceedings” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Backlog

Our funded backlog of unfilled orders was
approximately $962 million at July 30, 2004,
$891 million at July 25, 2003 and $886 million at
July 26, 2002. The determination of backlog involves
substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer
requirements contracts and long-term contracts of a
cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as the value of contract
awards received from the U.S. Government for which the U.S.
Government has appropriated funds and the appropriating agency
has given us authorization to spend these funds under the
contract, plus the amount of contract awards and orders received
from customers other than the U.S. Government which have yet to
be recognized as revenues. We expect to fill approximately
85 percent of our current funded backlog in fiscal 2005.
However, there can be no assurance that our funded backlog will
become sales in any particular period, if at all. Our funded
backlog does not include the full amount of our contract awards,
including those pertaining to multi-year, cost-reimbursable
contracts, which are generally funded on an annual basis. Funded
backlog also excludes the sales amount of unexercised contract
options that may be exercised by customers under existing
contracts and the sales amount of purchase orders that may be
issued under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering
agreements. Backlog is subject to delivery delays or program
cancellations, which are beyond our control.

Research, Development and
Engineering

Our businesses require substantial commitment of
resources to maintain significant positions in the markets we
serve. Research, development and engineering expenditures
totaled approximately $841 million in fiscal 2004,
$600 million in fiscal 2003 and $517 million in fiscal
2002.

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs, which included research and development for
commercial products and independent research and development
related to government products and services, were approximately
$111 million in fiscal 2004, $100 million in fiscal
2003 and $105 million in fiscal 2002. The portion of total
research, development and engineering expenditures not
company-sponsored was funded by U.S. Government and commercial
customers and is included in our revenues. Company-funded
research is directed to the development of new products and to
building technological capability in selected communications and
electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research
helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Almost
all of our segments maintain their own engineering and new
product development departments, with scientific assistance
provided by advanced-technology departments. We currently employ
about 5,000 engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts
to make the technologies developed in any of our business
segments available for all other business segments.



Patents and Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual
property rights, in the aggregate, to constitute an important
asset. We own a large and valuable portfolio of patents, trade
secrets, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and
other intellectual property. We also license intellectual
property to and from third parties. As of July 2, 2004, we
held approximately 638 U.S. patents and 136 foreign patents, and
had approximately 372 U.S. patent applications pending and 813
foreign patent applications pending. However, we do not consider
our business or any business segment to be materially dependent
upon any single patent, license or other intellectual property
rights, or any group of related patents or other intellectual
property rights. We are engaged in a pro-active patent licensing
program and have entered into a number of unilateral license and
cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income.
Although existing license agreements have generated income in
past years and may do so in the future, there can be no
assurances we will enter into additional income-producing
license agreements. With regard to patents relating to our
Government Communications Systems segment, the U.S. Government
often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize
others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant
to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our
use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.
Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products
are also considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental and Other Regulations

Our manufacturing facilities, in common with
those of industry in general, are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly
with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe that we have
complied with these requirements and that such compliance has
not had a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition. Expenditures to protect the environment and to comply
with current environmental laws and regulations over the next
several years are not expected to have a material impact on our
competitive or financial position. If future laws and
regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently
anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present
estimates of those expenditures. We have installed waste
treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy
legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and
prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
environmental capital projects in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002. A
portion of our environmental expenditures relates to
discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
material in fiscal 2005. These amounts may increase in future
years. Additional information regarding environmental matters is
set forth in “Legal Proceedings” and in

Note 1:
Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Radio communications are also subject to
governmental regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast
Communications and Microwave Communications segments, in
particular, is subject to domestic and international
requirements to avoid interference among users of radio and
television frequencies and to permit interconnection of
telecommunications equipment. We believe that we have complied
with such rules and regulations with respect to our existing
products, and we intend to comply with such rules and
regulations with respect to our future products. Reallocation of
frequency spectrum also could impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and
services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our
facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw
materials (such as electronic components, metals and plastics)
needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent
upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of
components and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors
to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery
schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon one or a few
sources, either because of the specialized nature of a
particular item or because of domestic preference requirements
pursuant to which we operate on a given project. While we have
been affected by financial and performance issues of some of our
suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially
adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or
products.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered
to be seasonal, although in recent years our revenues in the
second half of our fiscal year have generally exceeded revenues
in the first half. Various factors can affect



the distribution of our revenue between
accounting periods, including the timing of U.S. Government
awards, the availability of funding, product deliveries and
customer acceptance.

Employees

As of July 2, 2004, we employed
approximately 10,900 people compared with approximately 10,000
employees at the end of fiscal 2003. Approximately 10,000
employees are located in the United States. Approximately 1,300
employees are employed in the RF Communications segment, 1,100
in the Microwave Communications segment, 1,000 in the Broadcast
Communications segment and 7,000 in the Government
Communications Systems segment, with the remainder employed in
headquarters or other support or service functions. During the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 we completed the acquisition of The
Orkand Corporation, adding an additional 1,000 employees to the
Government Communications Systems segment. None of our employees
in the United States is represented by a labor union; however,
in certain international subsidiaries, our employees are
represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions.
In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are
good.

ITEM
2.     PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at
owned facilities in Melbourne, Florida. We operate approximately
78 office and manufacturing facilities in the United States,
Canada, Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting
of about 5.1 million square feet of manufacturing,
administrative, warehousing, engineering and office space, of
which about 4.1 million square feet are owned and about
1 million square feet are leased. There are no major
encumbrances on any of our facilities. Our leased facilities are
for the most part occupied under leases for terms ranging from
one month to 13 years, a majority of which can be terminated or



renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at
our option. As of July 2, 2004, the locations and floor
space of our principal offices and manufacturing facilities in
productive use were as follows:

In the opinion of management, our facilities,
whether owned or leased, are suitable and adequate for their
intended purposes and have capacities adequate for current and
projected needs. While we do have some unused or under-utilized
facilities, they are not considered significant. We continuously
review our anticipated requirements for facilities and will from
time to time acquire additional facilities, expand existing
facilities, and dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof,
as management deems necessary. For more information about our
lease obligations, see

Note 19: Lease Commitments

in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our facilities and
other properties are generally maintained in good operating
condition.



ITEM  3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time
to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind of
businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
related to: product liability; personal injury; patents,
trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products
containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or environmental
matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. While it is not
feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty,
and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed or
decided unfavorably to us, based upon available information, in
the opinion of management, settlements and final judgments, if
any, which are considered probable of being rendered against us
in existing litigation or arbitration are reserved against,
covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. Government Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such as
us, engaged in supplying goods and services to the
U.S. Government and its various agencies, are dependent on
Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
policies. U.S. Government contracts typically involve long
lead times for design and development, are subject to
significant changes in contract scheduling and may be
unilaterally modified or cancelled by the U.S. Government.
Often these contracts call for successful design and production
of complex and technologically advanced products or systems. We
may participate in supplying goods and services to the U.S.
Government as either a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to
a prime contractor. Disputes may arise between the prime
contractor and the U.S. Government and the prime contractor and
its subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
contracting parties.

As a defense contractor, our contract costs are
audited and reviewed on a continual basis by the Defense
Contract Audit Agency. In addition to these routine audits, from
time to time, we may, either individually or in conjunction with
other U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits
and investigations by other agencies of the
U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are
conducted to determine if our performance and administering of
our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable
contractual requirements, procurement and other applicable
Federal statutes and regulations. These investigations may be
conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict the
outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
against us, our officers or employees. Under present
U.S. Government procurement regulations, if indicted or
adjudged in violation of procurement or other Federal civil
laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating
divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines, penalties,
repayments or compensatory or treble damages. U.S. Government
regulations also provide that certain findings against a
contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from eligibility
for awards of new U.S. Government contracts for up to three
years. In addition, a U.S. Government contractor’s export
privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension or
debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of
our reliance on U.S. Government contracts.

International.

As an
international company, we are, from time to time, the subject of
investigations relating to our international operations,
including under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We
are subject to numerous Federal, state and foreign environmental
laws and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to
time in investigations or litigation of various potential
environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or
former facilities or remediation as a result of past activities.
From time to time we receive notices from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and equivalent state or foreign environmental
agencies that we are a potentially responsible party under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or
equivalent legislation. Such notices assert potential liability
for cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by
us, sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites
not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances
attributable to us from past operations. We have been named as a
potentially responsible party at 14 such sites, excluding sites
as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which
our liability has been finally determined. While it is not
feasible to predict the outcome of many of these proceedings, in
the opinion of our management, any payments we may be required
to make as a result of currently existing claims will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or our
business taken as a whole. Additional information regarding
environmental matters is set forth in

Note 1:
Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which Note is incorporated herein by
reference.



Other Matters.

We
previously filed a patent infringement claim against Ericsson,
Inc. in the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern
District of Texas. On October 29, 2002, a jury rendered a
verdict in our favor against Ericsson, Inc. and its parent
company. The jury awarded us approximately $61 million in
compensatory damages and found that Ericsson’s conduct was
“willful.” Following such verdict, we filed a motion
to enhance the damages based upon the finding of willfulness,
and Ericsson filed motions: (i) to decrease the damage
award, (ii) to order a new trial, and (iii) for
non-infringement and invalidity of the relevant patent
notwithstanding the jury’s verdict. On July 17, 2003,
the Court issued a ruling on these motions denying
Ericsson’s motions for non-infringement and invalidity of
the patent, but did rule that unless we agreed to a lowered
damage award of $43 million in compensatory damages, it was
granting Ericsson’s motion for a new trial on the issue of
damages. We agreed to the lowered damages and thus, a judgment
was entered for us in the amount of $43 million plus
$1 million for enhanced damages and $1 million for
attorneys’ fees, as well as pre-judgment interest, which we
currently estimate to be approximately $8 million. During
the second quarter of fiscal 2004, Ericsson appealed the
judgment of the District Court. We have filed a cross appeal
seeking to increase the amount of enhanced damages. The briefing
for the appeal was completed in the second quarter of fiscal
2004.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION
OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted by us to a vote of our
security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

The name, age, executive office, position held
with us, and principal occupation and employment during at least
the past 5 years for each of our executive officers as of
August 28, 2004, are as follows:



There is no family relationship between any of
our executive officers or directors, and there are no
arrangements or understandings between any of our executive
officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any
of them was elected as an officer or director, other than
arrangements or understandings with our directors or officers
acting solely in their capacities as such. All of our executive
officers are elected annually and serve at the pleasure of our
Board of Directors.

PART II

ITEM  5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON
    EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
    EQUITY SECURITIES.

Market Information

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS,” and
also is traded on the Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia Stock
Exchanges and through the Intermarket Trading System. According
to the records of our transfer agent, as of August 20,
2004, there were approximately 7,853 holders of record of our
common stock. The high and low sales prices as reported in the
consolidated transaction reporting system and the dividends paid
on our common stock for each quarterly period in our last two
fiscal years are reported below:

On August 20, 2004, the last sale price of
our common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction
reporting system was $46.71 per share.



Dividends

The dividends paid on our common stock for each
quarter in our last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables
above. On August 28, 2004, our Board of Directors increased
our annual dividend rate from $0.40 per share to
$0.48 per share and declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.12 per share, which will be paid on September 17,
2004 to holders of record on September 8, 2004. This
increase followed the increase of our annual dividend rate from
$0.20 per share to $0.32 per share in August of 2002
and from $0.32 per share to $0.40 per share in
August of 2003. We have paid cash dividends every year
since 1941 and currently expect that cash dividends will
continue to be paid in the near future; however, there can be no
assurances that this will be the case. The declaration of
dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of
factors, including our financial condition, capital
requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Issuer Repurchases of Equity
Securities

During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 1,304,400
shares of our common stock at an average price per share of
$43.25. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 217,500 shares of our
common stock at an average price per share of $27.36. We
currently expect that we will repurchase shares of our common
stock to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our
stock incentive plans. Additionally, if warranted, we will
consider accelerating our repurchases.

The following table sets forth information with
respect to repurchases by us of common stock during the fiscal
quarter ended July 2, 2004:

*

Periods represent our fiscal months.

(1)

On October 22, 1999, we announced that our
    Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which
    authorizes us to repurchase up to 15 million shares through
    open-market transactions, in negotiated block transactions or
    pursuant to tender offers. Pursuant to the terms of this 1999
    program, as of April 27, 2004, we had authority to
    repurchase an additional 520,000 shares. On April 27, 2004,
    we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share
    repurchase program which authorizes us to repurchase an
    additional three million shares through open-market transactions
    or in negotiated block transactions. This new program does not
    have an expiration date. The maximum number of shares that may
    yet be purchased under our currently authorized repurchase
    programs as of July 2, 2004 is 3,220,000. All repurchases
    made in the quarter ended July 2, 2004, under these
    programs were made in open-market transactions. As a matter of
    policy, we do not repurchase shares during the period beginning
    two weeks prior to the end of a fiscal quarter and ending two
    days following the public release of earnings and financial
    results for such fiscal quarter.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

We currently maintain two equity compensation
plans that provide for the issuance of our common stock or
options to acquire shares of our common stock to our directors,
officers and employees: the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Harris Corporation Stock Incentive Plan.
Each of these plans was approved



by our shareholders. The following table provides
information as of July 2, 2004 about our common stock that
may be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants and rights
under these equity compensation plans:

Equity Compensation Plan Information

(1)

Includes outstanding options for 6,171 shares of
    our common stock that were assumed in connection with our
    acquisition of WavTrace, Inc. in fiscal 2001. No additional
    awards can be granted under the plans pursuant to which these
    options were initially issued.

(2)

Under the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive
    Plan, we may grant an aggregate of not more than 2,500,000
    shares in the form of performance share awards, restricted stock
    awards, or other similar types of share awards. As of
    July 2, 2004, there were issued and outstanding 311,666
    shares of such awards under this plan. Because there is no
    exercise price associated with performance share awards or
    restricted share awards, such shares are not included in the
    weighted average price calculation.

BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications technology
company focused on providing assured communications products,
systems and services for government and commercial customers.
Our four operating divisions serve markets for government
communications, secure tactical radio, microwave and broadcast
systems. Our company generates revenues, income and cash flows
by developing, manufacturing and selling communications products
as well as providing services that are related to those
products. We generally sell products and services directly to
our customers, the largest of which is the U.S. Government
and its prime contractors; however, we do utilize agents and
distributors to sell some products and services, especially in
international markets.

We changed our segment reporting structure
effective May 28, 2004, in conjunction with the sale of our
TTS product line. The TTS product line was formerly part of the
Network Support segment. As a result of the sale, our
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes report the TTS
product line as discontinued operations, and accordingly, prior
periods have been restated. We also have eliminated the Network
Support segment as a separate reportable segment. The
NetBoss® network operations (“NetBoss®”)
product line, which was also part of the Network Support
segment, was not included in the sale and is now consolidated in
the Microwave Communications reporting segment for all periods
presented. The NetBoss® management team reports to the
President of the Microwave Communications Division. The
continuing operations of Harris are now reported under four
business segments: (1) Government Communications Systems,
(2) RF Communications, (3) Microwave Communications,
and (4) Broadcast Communications. Financial information
with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate
costs not allocated to the operating segments or discontinued
operations, is reported as part of Headquarters Expense or
Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Harris’ mission statement is as follows:
“Harris Corporation will be the best-in-class global
provider of mission-critical assured communications products,
systems and services to both government and commercial
customers, combining advanced technology and application
knowledge to offer a superior value proposition.”

Value Drivers of Our Business and Our Strategy
for Achieving Value

We are committed to our mission statement, and we
believe that executing our mission statement creates value.
Consistent with this commitment to effective execution, we focus
on these key value drivers:

•

Continued profitable growth;

•

Cost management; and

•

Efficient capital structure.

Continued Profitable
Growth:

Harris has a three-level
approach to deliver continued profitable growth to our
shareholders: (1) segment-level strategies,
(2) leverage synergies across segments, and (3) a
corporate-level strategy.

Our segment-level strategies include:

Government Communications Systems

•

Target government customer spending in the areas
    of transformational communications, intelligence and
    surveillance, information and image processing and technical
    services;

•

Continue to drive diversification and expand our
    addressable markets; and

•

Nurture our preferred communications equipment
    and systems provider positions within the industry.

RF Communications

•

Lead transformation of worldwide tactical defense
    radio systems including successful development of the
    Falcon® III radio;

•

Further penetrate international customer markets;

•

Execute well on the two long-term standardization
    programs — Bowman and JTRS — and expand our
    position on both; and

•

Continue to execute our successful strategy of
    operating as a commercial house with commercial pricing.

Microwave Communications

•

Leverage worldwide presence and strong reputation
    to fuel growth;

•

Expand addressable market in North America and
    continue to gain share;

•

Align supply chain and operations to achieve the
    “low cost producer” position; and



•

Use our newly introduced TRuepoint

TM

family of microwave radios to improve our long-term position in
    international markets.

Broadcast Communications

•

Stay well-positioned for the final phases of the
    U.S. transition to digital television;

•

Invest in and expand international market
    position to gain share;

•

Position Harris as the leader in driving the
    digital radio transition in the U.S.; and

•

Aggressively invest in automation software
    development to drive further workflow improvements for
    television and media customers.

Our second-level strategy to deliver continued
profitable growth is to leverage synergies across our segments.
One of the primary synergies is our ability to transfer
technology between segments and focus our research and
development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole.
This strategy also includes a plan to increase our revenue
through cross-selling sales channels such as selling our
Microwave Communications segment’s network management
software to our Broadcast Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments’ customers, selling our
Broadcast Communications segment’s portable broadcast
transmission equipment to the customers of our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments and
selling our Microwave Communications segment’s microwave
radios to our Broadcast Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments’ customers. Other methods
contemplated by this strategy are joint pursuits on new programs
for our government customers utilizing supply chain and
operations leverage and joint international market development
such as shared distributors and coordinated go-to-market
strategies.

On a corporate level, our strategies for
continued profitable growth include effective capital allocation
following macro-economic market and technology trends and making
effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
the strengths in our base divisions. Another corporate strategy
is to expand the view of our addressable markets by moving into
adjacent markets or into new markets that require similar
solutions and to expand our international presence through
direct and indirect channels.

Cost Management:

We have a continuing focus on cost
management. Our principal focus areas for cost management are to
drive down procurement costs with an emphasis on coordinated
supply chain management, to improve our manufacturing
efficiencies across all divisions, to optimize our facility
utilization and to dedicate engineering resources to focus on
continuous product cost reductions. The recent development of
our lower cost TRuepoint

TM

microwave radios and the
consolidation of our European manufacturing operations in our
Broadcast Communications segment are prime examples of how we
continue to implement cost-management initiatives. Also, we
constantly evaluate our level of infrastructure costs and adjust
them when necessary, which is evidenced by our cost-reduction
actions in both the Microwave Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments that took place in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004.

Efficient Capital Structure:

Our capital structure is intended
to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital
position, our access to key financial markets, our ability to
raise funds at low effective cost and our overall low cost of
borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We have $627.5
million in cash as of July 2, 2004 and have experienced
increased cash flows over the last fiscal year. Our cash is not
restricted and can be used to invest in strategic acquisitions,
invest in capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock or
pay dividends to our shareholders.

Measurements and Fiscal 2004
Highlights

We believe our value drivers, when implemented,
will: (1) increase our income from continuing operations
per diluted share; (2) improve our gross profit margin;
(3) provide additional leverage over time through reduced
engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenues; and (4) optimize our cost of capital. The
measure of our success will be reflected in our results of
operations and liquidity and capital resources:

Results of Operations Highlights:

Income from continuing operations;
income from continuing operations per diluted share; revenues;
gross margin; and engineering, selling and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements
of our value drivers:

•

Income from continuing operations increased
    79 percent from $70 million in fiscal 2003 to
    $126 million in fiscal 2004;

•

Income from continuing operations per diluted
    share increased 77 percent from $1.06 in fiscal 2003 to $1.88 in
    fiscal 2004;

•

Revenues increased 22 percent from
    $2.06 billion in fiscal 2003 to $2.52 billion in
    fiscal 2004;



•

Gross margin was 25.0 percent of revenue in
    fiscal 2004 compared to 25.1 percent of revenue in fiscal
    2003; and

•

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
    as a percentage of revenue decreased from 20.1 percent in
    fiscal 2003 to 16.7 percent in fiscal 2004.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations
Review” for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights:

In fiscal 2004, our net cash
provided from operating activities was $270 million, a
77 percent increase from fiscal 2003, and we expect to
generate from $200 to $250 million of net cash from
operating activities in fiscal 2005. We believe this ability to
generate significant cash flows to reinvest in our businesses
demonstrates one of Harris’ strengths. It enables us to
utilize cash in ways that our management believes provide the
greatest value. Principal uses of our cash flows in fiscal 2004
were:

•

Capital expenditures: In fiscal 2004 capital
    expenditures totaled $66 million;

•

Share repurchases: In fiscal 2004 share
    repurchases were $57 million; and

•

Dividends: In fiscal 2004 dividends were
    $27 million or $0.40 per common share.

Refer to MD&A heading “Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Financial Strategies” for more
information.

Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and
Risks

Government and Defense Industry:

Domestic and worldwide political
and economic developments continue to have a profound effect on
the defense and security of the U.S. Events such as the global
War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi
Freedom have altered the defense and homeland security
environment. These events have had, and will for the foreseeable
future have, a significant impact on the markets for defense,
communications and advanced technology products. At the same
time, the U.S. and its allies have undertaken a move toward a
more capabilities-based structure, which creates the ability for
a more flexible response through greater force mobility,
stronger space capabilities, enhanced missile defense and
improved information systems capabilities and homeland security.
As a result of these trends and technological developments, the
U.S. and its allies are placing more reliance on:
(i) sophisticated weapon systems that provide long-range
surveillance and intelligence, (ii) battlefield management
and precision strike expertise, (iii) the ability to
quickly and efficiently deploy complete defensive platforms
globally, and (iv) better communication and
interoperability between law enforcement, civil government
agencies, intelligence agencies and the military services of
multiple allied nations.

In August 2004, the U.S. Department of Defense
budget for its fiscal year 2005 was approved (the
U.S. Department of Defense’s fiscal year begins
October 1st). The $423.1 billion U.S. Department of
Defense 2005 budget is 6 percent above the U.S. Department
of Defense budget for its 2004 fiscal year, excluding the
supplemental appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom. While the U.S. Department of
Defense budget increase can be a positive indicator of growth
for the defense industry, we believe that the level of growth
and amount of budget ultimately allocated to the
U.S. Department of Defense procurement
(“Procurement”) and research, development, test and
evaluation (“RDT&E”) components of the U.S.
Department of Defense budget, are a better indicator of U.S.
Department of Defense spending. These accounts are applicable to
defense contractors, because they generally represent the
amounts that are expended for military hardware and technology.
The Procurement component was essentially flat and the RDT&E
component increased 12 percent in fiscal 2005 over fiscal
2004.

The budget for the U.S. Department of Defense for
fiscal 2005 and beyond reflects the above-mentioned
transformation of national defense policy in addition to the
increased needs for homeland security and the defeat of
terrorism. Budget increases are projected for operational
readiness and personnel needs, as well as Procurement and
RDT&E. Although the ultimate size of future defense budgets
remains uncertain, current indications suggest the defense
budget will continue to increase over the next several years.
Our management believes our experience and capabilities are well
aligned with the U.S. defense priorities and initiatives which
may increase the demand for our capabilities in areas such as
imaging, intelligence and surveillance, secure communications
and information technology systems.

We are subject to U.S. Government oversight.
Therefore, the U.S. Government may ask about and investigate our
business practices and audit our compliance with applicable
rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits
and investigations, the U.S. Government could make claims
against us. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations
and practices, an indictment of a government contractor could
result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from
being able to bid on, or be awarded, new U.S. Government
contracts for a period of time. A conviction could result in
debarment for a specific period of



time. Similar government oversight exists in most
other countries where we conduct business. We are currently not
aware of any compliance audits or investigations that could
result in a significant impact to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

While recent developments in the government and
defense industry have had a positive impact on our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments, we remain
subject to other risks associated with U.S. Government
business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on
annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive
regulations and other risks, which are discussed elsewhere in
this Annual Report.

Telecommunications Equipment Industry:

The global telecommunications
equipment industry has experienced a number of significant
challenges during the last five years. From the mid 1990’s
until 2000, network operators invested heavily in mobile
infrastructure driven by strong subscriber growth and increased
usage. Since the beginning of 2001, the market for
telecommunications equipment has contracted sharply. The years
of decline can be characterized by:

•

Auctions of 3G licenses, which led to spending by
    operators of the equivalent of seven years’ worth of
    infrastructure investments and licenses. This created a pause in
    the investment for network equipment for 2G, particularly in
    many markets in Western Europe.

•

Significant network capacity was deployed during
    the growth years and many operators subsequently reduced their
    capital spending to adjust for over-capacity.

•

Credit restrictions for telecom operators and
    vendors due to other investments in the sector caused a series
    of credit rating downgrades.

•

The resulting rapid and dramatic decline in
    demand forced equipment suppliers to reduce costs and adjust to
    the much lower demand.

•

Macroeconomic difficulties in certain markets,
    for example Latin America, put further pressure on the decline
    in equipment demand.

•

Technology changes dramatically altered the
    market, creating more complex networks with additional features
    and a larger mix of equipment and software from multiple
    vendors. This complexity has also led many operators to
    outsource their network management, allowing them to focus on
    their service offerings to their customer base.

Our Microwave Communications segment currently
remains subject to the general economic slowdown and limited
access to capital as well as the other risks associated with
this market, which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual
Report. Recently, however, the availability of capital has
improved along with a greater demand for wireless
telecommunications equipment. Our management believes that this
recent trend will continue. In North America, service providers
are expanding their cellular coverage and capacity. Many private
network infrastructures are nearing the end of their lifespan,
and Homeland Security grants are also becoming available to
private networks for upgrades that solve interoperability
issues, which are significant concerns after the events of
September 11, 2001.

Broadcast Industry:

The worldwide over-the-air
broadcast equipment industry is currently transitioning from
analog to digital broadcasting. At the same time, the broadcast
industry has been affected by delays in capital spending by
broadcasters. The digital transition is occurring most rapidly
for television broadcasting in the U.S., where the conversion to
digital has been mandated by Congress and is under the
management of the Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”). The new digital television technology
provides higher-quality TV pictures, a significant increase in
the amount of TV programming that can be delivered to consumers
and the opportunity for broadcasters to provide an array of new
services. In addition, conversion will make broadcast spectrum
available to be auctioned by the FCC for new commercial uses.
The FCC has recently adopted a Report and Order that implements
several steps necessary for the continued conversion of the
nation’s television broadcast systems to a digital
broadcast environment. Stations in the top one hundred markets
will have until 2005 to comply with full-power DTV transmission
requirements and all other markets will have until 2006. Our
Broadcast Communications segment will monitor the timing of
actual implementation as stations go through the final channel
selection process. Currently, approximately 1,500 of the
nation’s 1,688 commercial and public broadcasters have
ordered equipment that would allow them to meet at least the
minimum, first-step requirements of the FCC’s mandated
digital television rollout schedule. Nearly all U.S. households
now have access to at least one digital TV signal and HDTV set
sales in the first half of calendar 2004 are up 67 percent.
These actions mark additional steps in the progress toward
making the completion of the transition to digital television a
reality.



Domestic radio broadcasters also are taking steps
in transitioning from analog to digital technology. There are
approximately 12,000 radio stations in the United States. All
the previous technical issues delaying adoption of HD radio by
the broadcast community have been addressed, and we are seeing
signs that the market is about to shift from an early-adopter,
trial market to full digital roll-outs. For example, Clear
Channel Communications, the largest radio broadcaster in the
U.S., recently announced that it will install digital broadcast
equipment in 1,000 of its radio stations. Another key trend
affecting this area is a competing product, satellite radio,
which is gaining consumer awareness and acceptance. The
availability and distribution channels for satellite radios are
ahead of HD radios. Growing availability and acceptance of
satellite radio is driving a competitive response from
over-the-air radio broadcasters to offer a digital broadcast
alternative.

Internationally, the transition to digital
technologies, for both radio and television, is in various
stages of implementation. In general, digital television and
radio adoption has been slow across global markets, as there are
very few mandated conversions in the international arena.
Consequently, many international markets remain primarily analog
replacement markets where transmission equipment used by many
broadcasters is approaching the end of its life cycle.

In both television and radio, the industry trend
toward consolidation and multiple-location operations is
continuing and should drive increased future demand for
automation, networking and services to manage the consolidated
facilities. Similarly, broadcasters’ desire to find new
nontraditional revenue streams, such as datacasting, should also
drive increased spending on equipment and services.

Our broadcast management believes that our
experience and capabilities are well aligned with, and that we
are poised to take advantage of, the broadcast industry trends
noted above. While we believe that these developments generally
will have a positive impact on our Broadcast Communications
segment, we remain subject to general economic conditions that
could adversely affect broadcasters. We also remain subject to
other risks associated with the broadcast industry, including
technological uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s
regulations for the rollout of digital television, slow market
adoption of digital radio and other risks which are discussed
elsewhere in this Annual Report.

OPERATIONS REVIEW

Highlights

Operations highlights for fiscal 2004 include:

•

Income from continuing operations increased
    79 percent from $70.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted share,
    in fiscal 2003 to $125.7 million, or $1.88 per diluted
    share, in fiscal 2004;

•

Revenues increased 22 percent from
    $2.06 billion in fiscal 2003 to $2.52 billion in
    fiscal 2004;

•

Government Communications Systems and RF
    Communications segments achieved record-setting revenue and
    operating profit results;

•

Microwave Communications and Broadcast
    Communications segments continued to focus on profitability
    improvement and took additional actions in the fourth quarter to
    lower costs and reduce expenses going forward; and

•

The TTS product line was sold resulting in an
    $18.9 million pre-tax gain. As a result of the sale, we
    have reported the TTS product line as discontinued operations
    and accordingly, prior periods have been restated. The remainder
    of this discussion is on a continuing operations basis only.

Revenue and Income From Continuing
Operations

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal
2003:

Our revenue for fiscal 2004
was $2,518.6 million, an increase of 22.2 percent
compared to fiscal 2003. Increased revenues in our Government
Communications Systems,



RF Communications and Microwave
Communications segments were partially offset by decreased
revenues in our Broadcast Communications segment. Income from
continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was $125.7 million,
or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to $70.3 million,
or $1.06 per diluted share in fiscal 2003.

The increase in income from continuing operations
resulted primarily from increased operating income in our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. Our
Microwave Communications segment also experienced lower
operating losses in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003,
and our corporate headquarters expense and eliminations were
lower in fiscal 2004 at $59.0 million compared to
$69.6 million in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, we had a
non-operating loss of $11.0 million compared to
$23.7 million of non-operating income in fiscal 2003.

Our two government businesses continued to
deliver strong revenue growth and strong operating performance.
The Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments have benefited from a diverse customer base and broad
portfolio of tactical and strategic programs that support the
U.S. Government and international customers. Income from
continuing operations was impacted by $8.0 million of
after-tax charges associated with cost-reduction actions aimed
at reducing expenses in our Microwave Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments in fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal
2002:

Our revenue from product
sales and services for fiscal 2003 was $2,060.6 million, an
increase of 12.2 percent compared to fiscal 2002. Increased
revenues in our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments were partially offset by decreased
revenues in our Broadcast Communications and Microwave
Communications segments. Income from continuing operations for
fiscal 2003 was $70.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted
share, compared to $87.0 million, or $1.31 per diluted
share in fiscal 2002.

The decrease in income from continuing operations
resulted primarily from decreased operating income in our
Broadcast Communications segment as well as increased corporate
headquarters expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal
2002. Also, non-operating income decreased from
$41.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $23.7 million in
fiscal 2003. These items were partially offset by improvements
in the operating income of our RF Communications and Government
Systems Communications segments.

Fiscal 2003 income from continuing operations was
impacted by $24.5 million of after-tax charges associated with
reductions in labor, facility shutdowns, the discontinuation of
low-margin telecom products and disposal of assets remaining
from the previously exited telecom switch business. The fiscal
2003 results also included a $12.2 million after-tax gain
on the sale of our minority interest in our LiveTV, LLC joint
venture. Income from continuing operations was impacted in
fiscal 2002 by $10.4 million of after-tax charges
associated with reductions in labor, facility shutdowns and
collection losses related to the bankruptcy of a customer in
Latin America, as well as a $6.8 million after-tax gain
from the sale of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy
Controls Systems, LLC joint venture.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal
2003:

Our gross margin (revenue
less cost of product sales and services) as a percentage of
revenue was 25.0 percent in fiscal 2004 compared to
25.1 percent in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 gross margin was
impacted by $8.6 million of inventory write-offs associated
with the exit from our Microwave Communications segment’s
WinRoLL and RapidNet wireless local loop products
($5.8 million) and MDL microwave radio products
($1.3 million) and the shut-down of our manufacturing plant
in Brazil ($1.5 million).

Gross margins as a percentage of revenue improved
in our RF Communications, Microwave Communications and
Government Communications Systems segments in fiscal 2004 when
compared to fiscal 2003. The improved gross margin in our
RF Communications segment resulted from manufacturing
efficiencies related to



increased tactical product sales and program
execution, especially related to Bowman. In our Microwave
Communications segment, gross margins improved due to cost
reductions and efficiencies gained in the production of the
Constellation® radios sold in the North American market.
The Government Communications Systems segment had continued
solid program performance and higher award fees that included a
seldom-awarded incentive fee on a classified program for
excellent schedule performance and a successful contract
resolution.

The gross margin improvements as a percentage of
revenue in these three segments were offset by a larger mix of
sales in our Government Communications Systems segment that
carries a lower gross margin than our RF Communications
segment and our two commercial segments due to the high level of
cost-reimbursable programs it performs for the
U.S. Government. Also, the Broadcast Communications segment
experienced lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003, primarily resulting
from a lower mix of digital TV transmission product sales.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal
2002:

Our gross margin as a
percentage of revenue was 25.1 percent in fiscal 2003
compared to 26.3 percent in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 gross
margin was impacted by the $8.6 million of inventory
write-offs mentioned above. The lower gross margin also resulted
from our Broadcast Communications segment, which had lower
volume and a shift in product mix away from higher-margin
digital television equipment to lower-margin analog products. To
a lesser extent, our Microwave Communications segment’s
gross margin also was impacted by weak international markets and
supply chain issues, including the bankruptcy of a major
supplier in France and other disruptions that increased our
costs to deliver systems on time to our customers. These gross
margin decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin
from higher revenue and manufacturing efficiencies in our RF
Communications segment. Gross margin in our Government
Communications Systems segment was slightly lower than the prior
year due to favorable contract closeouts experienced in fiscal
2002.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative
Expenses

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal
2003:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased from $414.1 million in
fiscal 2003 to $421.0 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of
revenue, these expenses decreased from 20.1 percent of
revenue in fiscal 2003 to 16.7 percent of revenue in fiscal
2004. The increase in revenue outpaced the increase in
engineering, selling and administrative expenses primarily due
to the impact of cost-reduction actions taken in fiscal 2003 at
our corporate headquarters and separate cost-reduction actions
taken in our Microwave Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
were impacted by expenses associated with cost-reduction actions
of $7.3 million and $4.4 million in our Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments,
respectively, in fiscal 2004 and $8.3 million and
$4.4 million in our Microwave Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Fiscal
2004 engineering, selling and administrative expenses were also
impacted by a $4 million reversal of a previously
established reserve for the consolidation of our Broadcast
Communications segment’s European operations.

Headquarters expense, which is included in
engineering, selling and administration expenses, decreased in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due mostly to
$12.4 million of write-downs in fiscal 2003 related to the
disposal of assets remaining from our previously exited
telephone switch business and expenses associated with fiscal
2003 cost-reduction actions of $4.0 million. Fiscal 2003
headquarters expense also included a $4.2 million
contribution to our retiring Chief Executive Officer’s
supplemental executive retirement plan account.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our Government Communications Systems and RF
Communications segments to support significant growth in these
businesses and included a higher level of selling and marketing
and research and development activities. The rate of increase in
revenue in these segments, however, exceeded the rate of
increase in engineering, selling and administrative expenses.

Overall company-sponsored research and product
development costs, which are included in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses, were $111.3 million in fiscal
2004, compared to $99.8 million in fiscal 2003.



The increase was primarily due to a relatively
high level of spending on the development of our
Falcon® III radio in the RF Communications segment and
an increased level of independent research and development
projects and bids and proposals in our Government Communications
Systems segment.

Customer-sponsored research and development,
which does not impact engineering, selling and administrative
expenses, increased from $499.9 million in fiscal 2003 to
$729.9 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the
U.S. Government’s increased spending on research and
development projects. Customer-sponsored research and
development is included in our revenues and cost of product
sales and services.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Our engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased from $378.3 million in
fiscal 2002 to $414.1 million in fiscal 2003. As a
percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased from
20.6 percent in fiscal 2002 to 20.1 percent in
fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003 engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were impacted by $29.1 million of
expenses associated with cost-reduction actions in our corporate
headquarters ($4.0 million), Broadcast Communications
segment ($4.4 million) and Microwave Communications segment
($8.3 million), as well as write-downs related to the
disposal of assets remaining from our previously exited
telephone switch business ($12.4 million). Fiscal 2002
engineering, selling and administrative expenses were impacted
by $15.8 million of costs associated with the
cost-reduction actions ($8.8 million) and collection losses
related to the bankruptcy of a customer in Latin America
($7.0 million) in the Microwave Communications segment.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our Government Communications Systems segment, due
to increased volume and bid opportunities, and in our RF
Communications segment, due to increased volume and new product
development of JTRS and Falcon® III-related products.
Headquarters expense, which is included in engineering, selling
and administration expenses, also increased in fiscal 2003 when
compared to fiscal 2002, which was mainly driven by a
$4.2 million contribution to our retiring Chief Executive
Officer’s supplemental executive retirement plan account.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses in our
Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications segments
also were impacted by on-going cost-reduction actions at these
segments.

Overall company-sponsored research and product
development costs, which are included in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses, were $99.8 million in fiscal 2003,
compared to $104.9 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease was
primarily due to a relatively high level of spending on the
development of our broadband wireless access products in fiscal
2002. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending
by our RF Communications segment for the development of
JTRS and Falcon® III-related products.

Customer-sponsored research and development
increased from $412.3 million in fiscal 2002 to
$499.9 million in fiscal 2003. This was primarily a result
of the U.S. Government continuing significant spending for the
War on Terrorism.

Non-Operating Income (Loss)

*

Not meaningful

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

In fiscal 2004, the non-operating
loss was $11.0 million compared to $23.7 million of
non-operating income in fiscal 2003. Most of the change between
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was due to a decrease in gains from
the sale of securities available-for-sale from $21.9 million in
fiscal 2003 to $2.3 million in fiscal 2004 as well as an
$18.8 million gain from the sale of our minority interest in our
LiveTV, LLC joint venture in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004
non-operating loss also included a $5.0 million write-down of
our interest in Teltronics, Inc. related to impairment of this
investment that was other than temporary and an
$8.5 million pre-tax loss and a $6.4 million pre-tax
gain in two unrelated patent infringement cases. Expenses and
fees associated with selected investments were $2.5 million
in fiscal 2004 and $13.5 million in fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Our non-operating income decreased
from $41.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $23.7 million in
fiscal 2003. The decrease in non-operating income was primarily
due to a $42.3 million reduction in gains from the sale of
securities related to technology investments available-for-sale
from



$64.2 million in fiscal 2002 to
$21.9 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in non-operating
income also was due to a $10.3 million gain from the sale
of our minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Controls
Systems, LLC joint venture in fiscal 2002. These reductions were
partially offset by an $18.8 million gain from the sale of
our minority interest in our LiveTV, LLC joint venture in fiscal
2003. We also experienced a $10.0 million write-down of our
investment interest in Terion, Inc. in fiscal 2002 related to
impairment of this investment that was other than temporary. The
gains from the sale of securities available-for-sale in both
years resulted primarily from the sale of shares in Intersil
Corporation, which were acquired in August 1999 in connection
with the sale of our semiconductor operations. There was no
equity income or loss from investments in fiscal 2003, compared
to equity income of $7.3 million in fiscal 2002. In
September 2002, we sold our remaining investment accounted for
under the equity method of accounting, which was our minority
interest in LiveTV, LLC. Expenses and fees associated with
selected investments were $13.5 million in fiscal 2003 and
$22.8 million in fiscal 2002.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our interest income was relatively
unchanged from $6.1 million in fiscal 2003 to
$6.2 million in fiscal 2004. Our interest expense decreased
from $24.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $24.5 million in
fiscal 2004 due to a lower level of short-term debt in our
foreign subsidiaries.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Our interest income decreased from
$13.3 million in fiscal 2002 to $6.1 million in fiscal
2003. Fiscal 2002 benefited from interest received from the
previous overpayment of income taxes. Our interest expense
decreased from $26.7 million in fiscal 2002 to $24.9
million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to the repayment of
$98.6 million of our 6.65% debentures in the first quarter
of fiscal 2002, the retirement of our $30.5 million 6.38%
notes payable to banks in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and a
$6.9 million reduction during fiscal 2003 in high interest
rate notes with Brazilian banks. These actions were partially
offset by an increase in interest expense due to the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% convertible
debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our provision for income taxes as
a percentage of pre-tax income was 30.2 percent in fiscal
2004 and 35.0 percent in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the
rate in fiscal 2004 is primarily due to the settlement of a
foreign tax audit that resulted in an income tax benefit of
$3.3 million. The fiscal 2004 rate also includes a larger
benefit from the use of state, local and foreign income tax loss
carryforwards. In both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the impact
of export sales reduced our total tax rate below the statutory
rate, including state income taxes. Fiscal 2003 benefited from
research and development tax credits. The mix of foreign tax
rates and sources of foreign income and losses increased our tax
rates in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Our provision for income taxes as
a percentage of pre-tax income was 35.0 percent in fiscal
2003 and 34.0 percent in fiscal 2002. In both fiscal 2003
and fiscal 2002, the impact of export sales reduced our total
tax rate below the statutory rate, including state income taxes.
Fiscal 2002 benefited from the favorable resolution of certain
outstanding state tax liabilities, for which we had previously
provided. Fiscal 2003 benefited from research and development
tax credits. These decreases were partially offset by the impact
of the mix of foreign tax rates and sources of foreign income
and losses.



Discussion of Business Segments

Government Communications Systems
Segment

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Government Communications Systems
segment revenue increased 32.4 percent and operating income
increased 46.2 percent from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. Revenue
growth was all organic and was evident in each of this
segment’s primary U.S. Government customer groups. Gross
margins improved in this segment as a result of outstanding
performance on defense, intelligence, civil and technical
service programs; higher award fees, including a seldom-awarded
incentive fee on a classified program for excellent schedule
performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2004; and a
successful contract resolution in the second quarter of fiscal
2004. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased
in our Government Communications Systems segment to support the
significant growth in revenue, which drove a higher level of
selling and marketing and research and development activities.
In this segment, however, the increase in revenue exceeded the
increase in engineering, selling and administrative expenses.

Classified programs and previously awarded
non-classified contracts contributed to fiscal 2004 growth,
including the JSF program for the U.S. Air Force, the FTI
program for the FAA, the MAF/ TIGER database modernization
program for the U.S. Census Bureau and the MCOM program for
the U.S. Air Force. More recent wins also contributed to
the growth in fiscal 2004, including the Iraqi Media Network
program, avionics on the F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft for the
U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, the FAB-T program for the
U.S. Air Force and the AEHF program for the U.S. Navy.

Following the end of fiscal 2004, we completed
the acquisition of The Orkand Corporation for $66 million
in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. Orkand revenue was
$84 million for the 12 months ended June 2004. The
acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings.
Orkand adds significant scale to our mission-critical services
business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, this segment was
selected by the NRO to provide operations, maintenance and
support services for the agency’s global communications and
information systems. This program has a potential value of
$1 billion over ten years.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Government Communications Systems
segment revenue increased 23.0 percent and operating income
increased 22.7 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003.
Growth in our Government Communications Systems segment revenue
was all organic and resulted from a broad spectrum of defense
and other U.S. Government agencies’ continued
investment in newly integrated assured network communications
systems which had a positive impact across all areas of this
segment. Gross margins as a percentage of revenue in our
Government Communications Systems segment were slightly lower
than the prior year due to favorable contract closeouts
experienced in fiscal 2002. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased in our Government
Communications Systems segment due to increased volume and bid
opportunities; however, these expenses decreased as a percentage
of revenue.

Approximately 40 percent of the
$213.0 million increase in revenue from fiscal 2002 to
fiscal 2003 came from classified programs, and approximately
30 percent of the increase was attributed to three programs
that were awarded after January 2002: the MCOM program; the JSF
program; and the FTI program.

Other recent programs that produced increased
revenue included the MAF/ TIGER program for the U.S. Census
Bureau, the U.S. Air Force’s FAB-T program, the
U.S. Air Force and NGA’s Space-Based Radar program and
the NGA’s GGI program.



RF Communications Segment

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal
2003:

RF Communications segment
revenue increased 32.1 percent and operating income
increased 41.0 percent from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004.
This segment had exceptional growth from strong demand for the
Falcon® II secure tactical radio from both
U.S. and international defense forces. Domestically, the
upgrade of tactical radio equipment has been accelerated by
continuing troop deployments overseas. Increased demand
internationally was driven by efforts to combat terrorism and
increase national security around the world, communications
technology standardization programs in the Partnership for Peace
countries and requirements from coalition forces deployed in
both Iraq and Afghanistan. Revenue growth in the
RF Communications segment was also driven by our successful
participation in two long-term advanced radio development
contracts — the Bowman program for the
U.K. Ministry of Defense and the JTRS program for the
U.S. Department of Defense.

Operating margins increased in this segment in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 as a result of improved
manufacturing efficiencies related to increased tactical product
sales and program execution largely driven by Bowman.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
the RF Communications segment to support significant revenue
growth and included a higher level of selling and marketing and
increased spending on the development of our
Falcon® III radio. The Falcon® III is
currently being developed for U.S. Government customers and
incorporates JTRS technology and waveforms. It will also be
compatible with radios currently in the field. The increase in
revenue, however, outpaced the increase in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses.

The interoperability of the Falcon® family
of radios has become increasingly important as countries seek
communications superiority for joint missions. Fiscal 2004
orders included contracts to provide tactical radios for forces
being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. International orders
were received from NATO members and other countries, including
Abu Dhabi, Albania, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland,
Romania, Saudi Arabia, The Republic of the Philippines, Tunisia
and Uganda.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal
2002:

RF Communications segment
revenue increased 26.1 percent and operating income
increased 63.4 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003.
This improvement was related in great part to the strong demand
from U.S. and foreign military customers for our radios due
to the focus on combating terrorism and supporting homeland
security.

Increases in segment operating income outpaced
revenue growth. Higher revenue and favorable product mix drove
gross margins higher as we met the increased demand for our
products without incurring significant additional fixed costs.
Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
this segment due to increased volume and new product development
for products related to the JTRS program. Engineering, selling
and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, however,
decreased.

The segment has a strong position on two
next-generation tactical radio programs. During the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, our RF Communications segment won a
contract with potential revenues of more than $245 million
over six years to supply high-frequency radios for the
Bowman program, one of the most important land-based military
projects in recent U.K. history. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003, the segment met a major milestone on the Bowman
program by shipping the first production units of its
high-performance, HF radio systems, which were manufactured
at its operations in Basingstoke, United Kingdom.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, this
segment also was selected to incorporate its recently developed
Sierra

TM

-based cryptographic subsystem into
100 percent of the radios to be ordered under the first
“cluster” of the five-cluster JTRS program.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the RF
Communications segment received a $10 million order from
the U.S. Army Defense Early Response Fund (“DERF”),
which was the segment’s first significant order for
Homeland Security. DERF provides funding that allows agencies
such as the National Guard to purchase new radio equipment.



Growth in this segment in general, and the JTRS
development in particular, created a need to expand our
facilities. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003,
we purchased a building adjacent to one of our existing
facilities in Rochester, New York.

Microwave Communications Segment

*

Not meaningful

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal
2003:

Microwave Communications
segment revenue increased 10.9 percent from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004. The segment’s operating loss decreased from
$24.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $12.1 million in
fiscal 2004. As a result of the sale of our TTS business, the
NetBoss® network operations software business, which was
part of the Network Support segment, has been consolidated into
the Microwave Communications segment. North American sales
remained strong. After recent declines, revenue increased in
international markets. The revenue growth internationally was
driven by growth in the Middle East and Africa as this
segment solidified its position in this emerging market. This
included a project with MTN Nigeria, one of the largest
cellular network operations in Africa, to supply, design and
implement Harris MegaStar® radios for its high-capacity GSM
network. In fiscal 2004 Microwave Communications received
contracts valued at $56 million from MTN Nigeria.

The fiscal 2004 operating loss was impacted by
$7.3 million of expenses related to cost-reduction actions.
The fiscal 2004 results do not reflect the future benefit of
these cost reductions, which are expected to have a payback
period of fewer than 12 months. The actions include a net
workforce reduction of 98 worldwide and the transfer of
110 jobs related to administration and support functions
from Redwood Shores, California to lower-cost operations in
Durham, North Carolina. The segment also established
production and support for the new TRuepoint

TM

microwave radio family at its San Antonio, Texas facility,
where the successful Constellation® and MegaStar®
product lines are manufactured.

The segment’s fiscal 2003 operating loss was
impacted by $16.9 million of inventory write-offs and
cost-reduction actions associated with the exit from its WinRoLL
and RapidNet wireless local loop products ($5.8 million),
the exit from its MDL microwave radio products
($1.3 million), the shut-down of its Brazilian
manufacturing plant ($1.5 million), and the consolidation
of its research and development activities in the U.S. from
three locations to one location in Durham, North Carolina
and the reduction of infrastructure costs in some of its
international locations ($8.3 million).

Microwave Communications segment’s gross
margins improved in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due
to the write-downs mentioned above, as well as cost reductions
and efficiencies gained in the production of its
Constellation® radios sold in the North American
market. This segment’s engineering, selling and
administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2004 when compared
to fiscal 2003 due to the impact of expenses related to the
cost-reduction actions and the savings realized from the actions
taken in fiscal 2003.

Harris introduced TRuepoint

TM

, its
next-generation microwave radio platform, in fiscal 2004. The
TRuepoint

TM

product family will eventually cover
operating frequencies from 6 to 38 GHz, with capacity
scalable from 4 to 180 Mbits/sec. TRuepoint

TM

supports multiple communications interfaces, including IP, which
allows for maximum operator flexibility. In addition,
TRuepoint

TM

production costs are significantly lower
than its predecessor radio family. Product shipments began in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and are expected to increase
significantly in fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2004 Harris also continued to
expand its NetBoss® network operation software platform
with the release of an Element Manager version of the software.
NetBoss® was selected in fiscal 2004 by several large
international network operators, including MTC-Vodafone in
Kuwait and Telecom Americas and Claro, two of the largest mobile
operators in Brazil.

The $7.3 million of expenses related to
cost-reduction actions taken in fiscal 2004 included severance,
relocation and facility shutdown costs of $5.2 million,
$0.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The
severance



costs in fiscal 2004 resulted from the layoff of
208 employees from the following functions: manufacturing
– 98; management and administration – 39; sales and
marketing – 38; engineering – 22; and services –
11. Geographically, the individuals were from our locations in:
Montreal, Canada – 120; Redwood Shores,
California – 74; Latin America – 8; and
other – 6. All of these individuals were notified of their
employment status and the terms of their severance benefits
prior to July 2, 2004, and they will all receive severance
benefits prior to August 31, 2004.

The facility shut-down costs in fiscal 2004 of
$1.2 million related to vacating a portion of our
facilities in Redwood Shores, California ($1.0 million) and
vacating our facility in Bellevue, Washington
($0.2 million) and included the write-off of assets such as
leasehold improvements ($0.5 million) and lease termination
costs ($0.7 million). These facilities were vacated prior
to July 2, 2004.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Microwave Communications segment
revenue decreased 2.0 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal
2003. The segment’s operating loss increased from
$21.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $24.3 million in
fiscal 2003. The segment’s fiscal 2003 operating loss was
impacted by the inventory write-offs and cost-reduction actions
mentioned above. The fiscal 2002 operating loss was impacted by
$15.8 million of costs associated with the cost-reduction
actions primarily related to the shut-down of this
segment’s Calgary, Canada facility and cost reductions at
its Chatenay-Malabry, France location ($8.8 million) and
collection losses related to the bankruptcy of a customer in
Latin America ($7.0 million).

Revenue declined and segment operating losses
rose in this segment primarily as a result of capital spending
constraints in the international telecom equipment markets and
from competitive pressures among international equipment
vendors. The segment maintained its leadership position in North
America. Strong sales continued for our Constellation®
155 radios, which are designed specifically for the
high-performance requirements of North American mobile service
providers, utility networks and state and local governments.

Gross margins decreased in this segment in fiscal
2003 compared to fiscal 2002, mainly due to weak international
markets noted above, supply chain issues, including the
bankruptcy of a major supplier in France, and other disruptions
that increased our costs to deliver systems on time to our
customers. In fiscal 2003, we solidified our supply chain by
moving to more reliable and lower-cost vendors and redesigned
our international products to reduce product cost. Engineering,
selling and administrative expenses in this segment were
relatively flat as increased provisions for collection losses
offset savings experienced from cost-reduction activities. We
remained focused on reducing our overhead and product costs and
improving segment operating income.

The $8.3 million charge in fiscal 2003
mentioned above included severance, relocation and facility
shutdown costs of $2.6 million, $3.6 million and $2.1
million, respectively. The severance costs in fiscal 2003
resulted from the layoff of 137 employees from the following
functions: engineering – 76; services – 29; management
and administration – 26; and sales and marketing – 6.
Geographically, the individuals were from our locations in:
Bellevue, Washington – 38; Redwood Shores, California
– 25; Montreal, Canada – 18; Sao Paulo, Brazil –
15; Torrance, California – 12; Shenzhen, China – 12;
Mexico City, Mexico – 7; Calgary, Canada – 4; San
Antonio, Texas – 3; and other – 3. All of these
individuals were notified of their employment status and the
terms of their severance benefits prior to December 27,
2002, and they all received severance benefits prior to
February 26, 2003.

The facility shut-down costs in fiscal 2003 of
$2.1 million related to our vacating facilities in Sao
Paulo, Brazil ($1.1 million); Bellevue, Washington
($0.8 million); and Torrance, California
($0.2 million) and included the write-off of assets such as
leasehold improvements ($1.0 million); lease termination
costs ($0.8 million); and forfeited export tax credits
($0.3 million). All of these facilities were vacated prior to
December 27, 2002.

Broadcast Communications Segment

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Broadcast Communications segment
revenue decreased 8.9 percent from fiscal 2003 to fiscal
2004, and operating income increased from $8.0 million in
fiscal 2003 to



$8.1 million in fiscal 2004. Digital
television (“DTV”) revenue declined from fiscal 2003,
as U.S. station owners continued to delay their next round of
investment while awaiting an FCC mandate for full DTV
conversion. Analog radio shipments were also lower as the major
infrastructure project in Romania neared completion. Studio
products and systems revenue increased in fiscal 2004,
principally as a result of the Broadcast Communications
segment’s participation in the IMN program with the
Government Communications Systems segment.

Fiscal 2004 operating income includes
$4.4 million of costs associated with cost-reduction
actions, which included the layoff of 81 employees in the U.S.
and Europe and which are expected to have a payback period of
fewer than 12 months. The segment’s fiscal 2004
operating income also includes a $4 million reversal of a
previously established reserve for the consolidation of this
segment’s European operations. In addition to
cost-reduction actions, we also realigned this segment in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 into five market-focused,
customer-facing business units to drive revenue growth and
improve customer responsiveness. Fiscal 2003 operating income
also includes a $4.4 million charge associated with
cost-reduction actions aimed at reducing infrastructure costs.
The fiscal 2004 operating income was also negatively impacted by
poor manufacturing productivity associated with the
implementation of a new segment-wide IT enterprise system and
the relocation of European manufacturing from Rankweil, Austria
to Huntingdon, U.K.

Digital radio, also known as HD
Radio

TM

, is continuing to gain momentum in the U.S.
market. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we received an
order from the largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., Clear
Channel Communications, for 17 HD Radio

TM

transmitters. Clear Channel also announced that over the next
three years it will roll out digital broadcasting equipment to
1,000 of its radio stations.

We recently released additional modules for the
Harris Resource Suite

TM

, powerful workflow management
software that extends the benefits of Master Control automation
across the entire ingest-to-broadcast process. The modules
released were: Broadcast Presentation Manager, which allows the
management of networks from both local and remote locations;
Media Asset Management, which has the capability to segment,
index and distribute digital content for future playback; and
Digital Ingest 1.1, which automates the front-end media ingest
and transfer process. Each of these solutions is focused on
improving productivity for our broadcast customers.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Broadcast Communications segment decided to exit its
unprofitable TV systems integration business, which contributed
approximately $13 million in revenue in fiscal 2004.

The $4.4 million of expenses related to
cost-reduction actions taken in fiscal 2004 all related to
severance costs. The severance costs resulted from the layoff of
81 employees from the following functions: management and
administration – 24; engineering – 23; sales and
marketing – 22; and manufacturing – 12.
Geographically, the individuals were from our locations in:
France – 27; Mason, Ohio – 27; Austria – 15;
Quincy, Illinois – 5; Sunnyvale, California – 3; and
other – 4. All of these individuals were notified of their
employment status prior to July 2, 2004, and all will
receive severance benefits prior to August 31, 2004 unless
legal notification requirements go beyond that date.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Broadcast Communications segment
revenue decreased 11.2 percent from fiscal 2002 to fiscal
2003 and operating income decreased from $37.2 million in
fiscal 2002 to $8.0 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003
operating income includes $4.4 million of costs associated
with cost-reduction actions aimed at reducing infrastructure
costs. Most of the decrease in revenue came from a decline in
DTV equipment sales.

Analog television transmitter and studio systems
revenues also decreased. These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in analog radio transmitter sales that related in
large part to a $64 million order to provide products and
services for the radio broadcast infrastructure of S.N.
Radiocomunicatii S.A., Romania’s state-owned broadcast
organization. The continued delay in capital spending by
customers was the result of continued weak advertising revenue,
smaller-market broadcasters installing the minimum amount of
equipment necessary to temporarily comply with the FCC’s
digital conversion mandates and disruption costs associated with
the news coverage of the War in Iraq.

This segment had significantly lower gross
margins in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 due to the
lower volume and the shift in product mix away from
higher-margin DTV equipment to lower-margin analog radio
products. This segment’s engineering, selling and
administrative expenses were lower in fiscal 2003 when compared
to fiscal 2002, due to the lower volume and ongoing
cost-reduction actions. Engineering, selling and administrative
expenses as a percent of revenue, however, increased in fiscal
2003 when compared to fiscal 2002, as cost-reduction measures
did not keep pace with the 11.2 percent reduction in
revenue. We also took steps to



improve Broadcast Communications segment
operating income at the current revenue levels through ongoing
focus on cost controls.

The fiscal 2003 $4.4 million charge
mentioned above included severance and relocation costs of
$2.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The
severance costs resulted from the layoff of 94 employees from
the following functions: engineering – 36; manufacturing
– 26; management and administration – 20; and sales
and marketing – 12. Geographically, the individuals were
from our locations in: Littleton, Massachusetts – 26;
Rennes, France – 23; Mason, Ohio – 16;
Quincy, Illinois – 12; Sunnyvale, California – 7;
Winnersh, U.K. – 6; and other – 4. All
of these individuals were notified of their employment status
prior to June 27, 2003, and all received severance benefits
prior to August 31, 2003.

Headquarters Expense and Corporate
Eliminations

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Headquarters expense decreased
25.7 percent from $69.6 million in fiscal 2003 to
$51.7 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 headquarters
expense included severance costs associated with cost-reduction
actions aimed at reducing infrastructure costs
($4.0 million) and write-downs related to the disposal of
assets remaining from our previously exited telephone switch
business ($12.4 million). Fiscal 2003 headquarters expense
also included a $4.2 million contribution to our retiring
Chief Executive Officer’s supplemental executive retirement
plan account.

In fiscal 2003, intersegment sales were
transferred at prices comparable to those provided to
unaffiliated customers. In fiscal 2004, intersegment sales were
transferred at cost to the buying division and the sourcing
division recognized a normal profit that was eliminated in the
“corporate eliminations” line item in our segment
reporting set forth in

Note 23: Business Segments

in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This change in
the intersegment policy resulted in an elimination of
intercompany profit, which was $7.3 million in fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 Compared With Fiscal 2002:

Headquarters expense increased
41.8 percent from $49.1 million in fiscal 2002 to
$69.6 million in fiscal 2003 due to higher fiscal 2003
expenses for the reasons mentioned above. The severance costs
resulted from the layoff of 73 employees who were all from
management and administrative functions. Geographically, the
individuals were from our locations in: Melbourne, Florida
– 70 and other – 3. All of these individuals were
notified of their employment status prior to June 27, 2003,
and received severance benefits prior to August 31, 2003.

Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we completed
the sale of our TTS product line to a subsidiary of Danaher
Corporation for $49.7 million, subject to post-closing and
other adjustments. The gain on the sale that has been recorded
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $18.9 million
pre-tax and $9.1 million after-tax. This transaction, along
with the results of the TTS product line, has been reported as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented. Revenues from
the TTS product line were $40.3 million, $32.1 million
and $40.0 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The product line also had pre-tax operating losses
of $3.5 million, $18.1 million and $6.6 million in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discontinued
operations are more fully discussed in

Note 2:
Discontinued Operations

in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Outlook

We are uniquely positioned to leverage
opportunities in both the government and commercial
communications markets. In our Broadcast Communications and
Microwave Communications segments, we have taken additional
cost-reduction actions, realigned organization structures to
better serve our markets, and introduced important new products.
We expect the contribution from these two segments to increase
overall profitability of Harris in fiscal 2005. In our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments, strong demand for mobility, interoperability and speed
of communications around the world supports continued momentum.
We have a sizeable program backlog and numerous new
opportunities that we are pursuing. Although we continue to be
cautious regarding total U.S. Government spending levels,
we will benefit from our well-diversified customer and program
base. We believe that the transformation of the global defense



communications infrastructure currently underway
is absolutely critical to provide greater national security, and
it will remain an area of great focus and investment.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL
STRATEGIES

Cash Flows

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Our cash and cash equivalents
increased $184.9 million to $627.5 million in fiscal 2004,
primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of
$270.3 million, $44.7 million of proceeds received
from the sale of our TTS product line and $37.0 million of
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. These
increases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by
$66.4 million of plant and equipment additions,
$56.5 million of common stock repurchases and
$26.6 million of cash dividends.

Management currently believes that existing cash,
funds generated from operations, sales of marketable securities,
our credit facilities and access to the public and private debt
markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated
requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases under the current repurchase program for the next
12 months and the foreseeable future. We expect tax
payments over the next three years to approximate our tax
expense during the same period. We anticipate that our fiscal
2005 cash payments will include strategic acquisitions. The
acquisition of The Orkand Corporation was completed during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 for a cash payment of
$66 million. Other than for potential acquisitions, no
other significant cash payments are anticipated in fiscal 2005
or beyond, other than those noted in the Contractual Obligations
discussion below.

There can be no assurance, however, that our
business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels,
or that anticipated operational improvements will be achieved.
If we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to service our obligations,
we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures,
refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain
additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal
payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness
depends on our future performance and financial results, which,
to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
affecting the defense, telecommunications equipment and
broadcast industries and to general economic, political,
financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities:

Our net cash provided by operating
activities was $270.3 million in fiscal 2004 compared to
$152.8 million in fiscal 2003. The positive cash flows from
operating activities in fiscal 2004 are primarily due to strong
profits and improved asset management performance in our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments. Each of our segments had positive cash flow from
operating activities during fiscal 2004. The improvement in our
RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
segments’ net cash provided by operating activities in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was the result of
increased profitability and strong program execution that
resulted in a decrease in unbilled costs and accrued earnings on
fixed-price contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities
also improved in our Microwave Communications segment during
fiscal 2004 primarily due to a reduction in this segment’s
operating loss as well as improved collections of accounts and
notes receivable and improved capital management of accounts
payables and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by operating
activities in our Broadcast Communications segment in fiscal
2004 was positive but was lower than the net cash provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2003 due to increased levels of
inventory. This segment recently implemented a modernized IT
enterprise system across all of its locations that should help
improve its inventory management in the future.

Net cash used in investing activities:

Our net cash used in investing
activities was $16.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to net
cash used in investing activities of $29.3 million in
fiscal 2003. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal
2004 was due to additions of plant and equipment of
$66.4 million and cash paid for selected



investments of $2.8 million, which was
partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of our TTS
product line of $44.7 million and proceeds from the sale of
securities available-for-sale of $7.9 million. Net cash
used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 was due to additions
of plant and equipment of $73.0 million and cash paid for
selected investments of $5.4 million, which was partially
offset by proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in our
LiveTV, LLC joint venture of $19.0 million and proceeds
from the sale of securities available-for-sale of
$30.1 million.

The decrease in our additions of plant and
equipment from $73.0 million in fiscal 2003 to
$66.4 million in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to larger
spending on a network operations command center for our FAA FTI
program in fiscal 2003 and the fiscal 2003 purchase of a
building in Rochester, New York to support the growth in our RF
Communications segment. In fiscal 2004, we renovated and
expanded buildings to support the growth in our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments. Our total
additions of plant and equipment in fiscal 2005 are expected to
be in the $80 million to $90 million range.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities:

Our net cash used in
financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $69.7 million
compared to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal
2003 of $95.0 million. The net cash used in financing
activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to repurchase of our
common stock of $56.5 million and $26.6 million of
cash dividends paid. Net payments of borrowings in fiscal 2004
were $23.6 million, as we reduced short-term debt in our
foreign subsidiaries. Proceeds from the exercise of employee
stock options of $37.0 million in fiscal 2004 partially
offset these payments. In fiscal 2004, we issued 1,312,839
shares of common stock to employees under the terms of our
option and incentive plans.

The net cash provided by financing activities in
fiscal 2003 was primarily due to net proceeds from debt
borrowings of $119.9 million, which primarily reflects the
net receipt of $145.2 million from the private placement of
$150.0 million of our 3.5% Convertible Debentures and the
retirement of $30.5 million of our 6.38% notes payable
during fiscal 2003. Other items included in net cash provided by
financing activities in fiscal 2003 were cash dividends of $21.2
million, cash paid for the repurchase of common stock of
$6.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock
of $2.3 million upon the exercise of employee stock
options. In fiscal 2003, we issued 289,975 shares of common
stock to employees under the terms of our option and incentive
plans.

Common Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2004, we used $56.5 million to
repurchase 1,304,400 shares of our common stock at an average
price per share of $43.25 plus commissions. In fiscal 2003, we
used $6.0 million to repurchase 217,500 shares of our
common stock at an average price per share of $27.36 plus
commissions. We currently expect that we will repurchase shares
of common stock to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued
under our stock incentive plans. Additionally, if warranted, we
will consider accelerating our purchases. Additional information
regarding repurchases made during fiscal 2004 and our repurchase
programs is set forth under Part II Item 5, “Market
For The Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Dividend Policy

On August 28, 2004, our Board of Directors
authorized a 20 percent increase in our quarterly common
stock dividend to $0.12 per share for an annualized rate of
$0.48 per share. This is our third consecutive annual
increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $0.40, $0.32 and
$0.20 per share in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Capital Structure and Resources

We have a committed Revolving Credit Agreement
that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to
$300 million. At July 2, 2004, no borrowings were
outstanding under this credit facility, which expires in October
2007. Each bank’s obligation to make loans to us under this
credit facility is subject to, among other things, the accuracy
of our representations and warranties and compliance with
various covenants. Interest rates on borrowings under this
credit facility and related fees are determined by a pricing
matrix based upon our long-term debt rating assigned by Standard
and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors
Service. The availability of borrowing under this credit
facility is not contingent upon our debt rating. We are not
required to maintain compensating balances in connection with
this agreement. While we did not issue commercial paper in
fiscal 2004, availability of borrowings under this revolving
credit facility enables us to issue commercial paper. The
financial covenants contained in this credit facility include,
among others, maintenance of consolidated tangible net worth of
not less than $842.6 million (which amount is subject to
adjustment), maintenance of a total debt



to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1
and maintenance of an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to interest charges ratio of not
less than 3.0 to 1 for four trailing quarters. This credit
facility also includes negative covenants limiting (i) the
creation of liens or other encumbrances, (ii) certain sale
and leaseback transactions, and (iii) certain sales or
other dispositions of assets other than in the ordinary course
of business. In addition, this facility includes certain
provisions for acceleration of maturity in the case of a (a)
“cross default” with other indebtedness in an amount
in excess of $50 million, (b) final uninsured judgment
in excess of $50 million which remains unpaid or
discharged, or (c) change of control, including if a person or
group of persons acquires more than 25 percent of our
voting stock.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we filed
a “universal shelf” registration statement with the
SEC related to the potential future issuance of up to
$500 million of securities, including debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock, fractional interests in preferred
stock represented by depositary shares and warrants to purchase
debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. This universal
shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC
during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and replaces our prior
$500 million debt shelf registration.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million of
3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022. These debentures initially
are convertible at a conversion price of $45.25 during any
calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock, for
at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day
period ending on the last trading day of the prior calendar
quarter, is more than $49.78, and in certain other circumstances
as described in

Note 16: Net Income Per Share

in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to our
$150 million 3.5% Convertible Debentures, we have outstanding
unsecured long-term debt of $251.4 million. The earliest
maturity of any long-term debt is fiscal 2007.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit
aggregating $32.9 million from various U.S. and
international banks, of which $27.1 million was available
on July 2, 2004. These lines provide for borrowings at
various interest rates, typically may be terminated upon notice,
may be used on such terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and
us and are reviewed annually for renewal or modification. These
lines do not require compensating balances. We have a short-term
commercial paper program in place, which we may utilize to
satisfy short-term cash requirements. This program has not been
used since the private placement on August 26, 2002 of
$150 million of our 3.5% Convertible Debentures. There were
no borrowings under the commercial paper program at July 2, 2004.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB” by
Standard and Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by
Moody’s Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating
ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios
sufficient for retention of these debt ratings. There are no
assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in the
future. If our credit rating is lowered below “investment
grade,” then we may not be able to issue short-term
commercial paper, but would instead need to borrow under our
other credit facilities or pursue other alternatives. We do not
currently foresee losing our investment-grade debt ratings. If,
however, our debt ratings were downgraded, it could adversely
impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and
access to capital markets.

Contractual Obligations

At July 2, 2004, we had contractual cash
obligations to repay debt (including capital lease obligations,
which are immaterial), to purchase goods and services and to
make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these
long-term obligations are as follows:

The purchase obligations of $432.3 million
noted above include $314.9 million of purchase obligations
related to our Government Communications Systems segment, which
are fully funded under contracts with the



U.S. Government. $160.4 million of these
purchase obligations relate to cost-plus type contracts where
our costs are fully reimbursable.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC
rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained contingent interest in assets
    transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or
    similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market
    risk support to that entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation under certain derivative
    instruments; and

•

Any obligation under a material variable interest
    held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides
    financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the
    registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and
    development services with the registrant.

Currently we are not participating in
transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest
entities, and we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets as defined above. As of the end of fiscal 2004, we did
not have material financial guarantees or other contractual
commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
liquidity. In addition, we are not currently a party to any
related party transactions that materially affect our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Commercial Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in
the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby
letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with
financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the
guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide
products and services to customers and to obtain insurance
policies with our insurance carriers. At July 2, 2004, we
had commercial commitments on outstanding letters of credit,
guarantees and other arrangements, as follows:

Financial Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates and changes in interest rates. We employ established
policies and procedures governing the use of financial
instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use foreign exchange contracts
and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet
future foreign currency commitments. Generally, these foreign
exchange contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory
and purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable
from and future committed sales to customers and intercompany
loans. We believe the use of foreign currency financial
instruments should reduce the risks that arise from doing
business in international markets. At July 2, 2004, we had
open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
$93.9 million, of which $30.0 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $63.9 million were classified as
fair value hedges. This compares to total



foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount
of $95.7 million as of June 27, 2003, of which
$18.1 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$77.6 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
July 2, 2004, contract expiration dates range from less
than one month to 18 months with a weighted average contract
life of 0.2 years.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the Bowman
program in our RF Communications segment. This contract for our
tactical radio products was awarded in the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer pays in Pounds
Sterling. We have hedged the forecasted cash flows related to
payments made to the U.S. operations to maintain our anticipated
profit margins. We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to
suppliers to maintain our anticipated profit margins in the U.K.
operations. As of July 2, 2004, we estimated that a pre-tax
loss of $3.2 million would be reclassified into earnings
from comprehensive income within the next 18 months related
to the cash flow hedges for the Bowman program. The amount of
pre-tax loss that would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income from the other transactions we are hedging
with cash flow hedges was not material as of July 2, 2004.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 representing the amount of fair value and
cash flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No
amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 related to the component of the derivative
instruments’ gain or loss excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in
our earnings in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to hedged
firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.
All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on
the balance sheet in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”).

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of
our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of
sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
derivatives held at July 2, 2004 would have an impact of
approximately $8.3 million on the fair value of such
instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
commitments.

Interest Rates:

We utilize a balanced mix of debt
maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and
available lines of credit to manage our exposure to changes in
interest rates. We do not expect changes in interest rates to
have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal 2005,
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
change significantly.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 39 percent of our
international business is transacted in local currency
environments. The impact of translating the assets and
liabilities of these operations to U.S. dollars is included as a
component of shareholders’ equity. At July 2, 2004,
the cumulative translation adjustment reduced shareholders’
equity by $6.1 million compared to a reduction of
$13.0 million at June 27, 2003. We utilize foreign
currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of
international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from
currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our
results in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently
followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the
impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for
employees and the cost of purchased materials and services.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The following is not intended to be a
comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in our Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. In preparing our financial
statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and
balances, we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider the
policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our
financial statements because their application places the most
significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting
results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical
accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on
our business operations are discussed throughout this MD&A
where such policies affect our



reported and expected financial results. Senior
management has discussed the development and selection of the
critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included
herein with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Preparation of this Annual Report requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the
“critical” accounting policy criteria, we make many
other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements
and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed
critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and
other information available prior to the issuance of the
financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known,
including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts and
Contract Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived
from long-term development and production contracts, which are
accounted for under the provisions of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position
No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP 81-1”), and cost-reimbursable contracts
with the U.S. Government also are specifically accounted
for in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43,
Chapter 11, Section A, “Government Contracts,
Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee Contracts” (“ARB 43”).

Revenues related to long-term contracts are
recorded using the percentage-of-completion method generally
measured by the costs incurred on each contract to-date against
estimated total contract costs at completion
(“cost-to-cost”) with consideration given for risk of
performance and estimated profit. The percentage-of-completion
method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments. Revenues are recorded on certain long-term production
contracts within our RF Communications segment using the
units of delivery method rather than the cost-to-cost method.
Under the units of delivery method, sales and profits are
recorded based on the ratio of actual units delivered to
estimated total units to be delivered under the contract.
Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
items that may change the scope of a contract are included in
revenues only when they can be reliably estimated and
realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award fees
applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally
are not recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally
are not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the
segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.

Under the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to
recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of
performance. Recognition of profit on long-term fixed-price
contracts requires estimates of: the contract value or total
contract revenue; the total cost at completion; and the
measurement of progress toward completion. The estimated profit
or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the
estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at
completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our programs,
developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires
significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in
estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity
and availability of labor, the nature and complexity of the work
to be performed, availability of materials, subcontractor
performance, the impact of delayed performance, availability and
timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of
claims outside the original contract included in any estimate to
complete. We review cost performance and estimates to complete
on our ongoing and acquired contracts at least quarterly and in
many cases more frequently. If a change in estimated cost to
complete a contract is determined to have an impact on contract
earnings, we will record a positive or negative adjustment to
estimated earnings when identified. Revenues and profits on a
cost-reimbursable contract are recognized when allowable costs
are incurred in an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the
profit on those costs. These profits may be at a fixed or
variable percentage of allowable costs, depending on the
contract fee arrangement. Thus, cost-reimbursable contracts
generally are not subject to the same estimation risks that
affect fixed-price contracts.

We have not made any material changes in the
methodologies used to recognize revenues on long-term contracts
or to estimate our costs related to long-term contracts in the
past three fiscal years. As of July 2, 2004, the amount of
unbilled costs and accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $111.1 million compared
to $164.8 million as of June 27, 2003. These amounts
include gross costs and



accrued income, which is netted against billings
and progress payments. A significant change in an estimate on
one or more programs could have a material effect on our
statement of financial position and results of operations. For
example, a one percent variance in our estimate of accrued
income booked as of July 2, 2004 on all open fixed-price
contracts would impact our pre-tax income and our cost of
product sales and services by $4.4 million.

Provisions for Excess and Obsolete Inventory
Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or
market. We balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels
to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of
excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and
customer requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities
on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. The review of excess and obsolete
inventory primarily relates to our Microwave Communications,
Broadcast Communications and RF Communications segments. Several
factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories,
including our decisions to exit a product line, technological
change and new product development. These factors could result
in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on
hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may
prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or
overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete
inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory was
overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in
“Cost of product sales and services” in our
Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
determination. Likewise, if we determine our inventory is
undervalued, we may have overstated “Cost of product sales
and services” in previous periods and would be required to
recognize such additional income. We have not made any material
changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our
inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.

As of July 2, 2004, our reserve for obsolete
and excess inventory was $52.7 million, or 19 percent
of our gross inventory balance, which compares to our reserve of
$34.0 million, or 14 percent of the gross inventory
balance as of June 27, 2003. We recorded $5.0 million,
$15.4 million and $19.1 million in inventory
write-down charges during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In fiscal 2003, inventory write-downs of
$8.6 million related to our exit from unprofitable products
and the shutdown of our Brazilian manufacturing plant in the
Microwave Communications segment. In fiscal 2002, inventory
write-downs were primarily due to the slow-down in demand for
our Microwave Communications segment’s products as a result
of weak international markets where a lack of capital radically
reduced the expansion of telecom infrastructure. Although we
make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our
forecasts of future product demand, including the impact of
planned future product launches, any significant unanticipated
changes in demand or technological developments could have a
significant impact on the value of our inventory and our
reported operating results.

Valuation of Selected Investments

Selected investments are accounted for using the
cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
cost exceeds fair value. For those investments that are illiquid
and privately held securities that do not have readily
determinable fair values, the determination of fair value
requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
estimate the value of the securities without an independent
appraisal based upon available information such as projected
cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
underlying company. We use judgment in estimating the fair value
based on our evaluation of the investee and establishing an
appropriate discount rate, terminal value and long-term growth
rate to apply in our calculations. In instances where a security
is subject to liquidation preferences or transfer restrictions,
the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
of the same security without liquidation preferences or transfer
restrictions but may be reduced by an amount estimated to
reflect such preferences or restrictions. In addition, even
where the value of a selected investment is derived from an
independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain
assumptions may be required to determine whether our selected
investment is more or less marketable than those investments
being quoted. We evaluate our selected investments for
“other than temporary” impairment. Impairment may
exist when the fair value of a selected investment has been, or
is expected to be, below the carrying value for an extended
period of time. If an “other than temporary”
impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the
value of the selected investment recorded on the financial
statements and fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings
in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other
than temporary. We have not made any material changes in the
methodology used to determine the valuation of our selected
investments during the past three fiscal years.

As of July 2, 2004, we own
$37.8 million of selected investments that are included in
the “Other assets” caption in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, which compares to $38.8 million as of June 27,
2003. Independent



appraisals were obtained to derive the fair value
of these investments. We make every reasonable effort to ensure
the accuracy of our estimate of the value of our selected
investments. Any significant unanticipated changes in the
underlying assumptions used by independent appraisers or us
could have a significant impact on these estimates.

Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“Statement 142”), we are
required to perform an annual (or under certain circumstances
more frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill
impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first
step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify
potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting
unit, which we define as our business segments, with its net
book value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second
step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
to acquire the reporting unit. We have not made any material
changes in the methodology used to determine the valuation of
our goodwill or the assessment of whether or not goodwill is
impaired during the past three fiscal years.

There are many assumptions and estimates
underlying the determination of the fair value of a reporting
unit. These assumptions include projected cash flows, discount
rates, comparable market prices of similar businesses, recent
acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace and a
review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying
business. We completed impairment tests as of April 2,
2004, with no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2,
2004 and June 27, 2003 was $223.3 million and
$214.3 million, respectively. Although we make every
reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the
fair value of our reporting units, future changes in the
assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the
recording of an impairment loss. A 10 percent variance,
however, in our estimate of any of our reporting units’
fair value would not lead to any further tests for impairment as
described above.

Income Taxes and Tax Valuation
Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax
jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets
recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation
allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax
assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary
income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward
periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our
deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
tax planning strategies. We have not made any material changes
in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation
allowances during the past three fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2,
2004, includes a current deferred tax asset of
$114.1 million and a non-current deferred tax liability of
$2.8 million. This compares to a current deferred tax asset
of $83.1 million and a non-current deferred tax asset of
$21.1 million as of June 27, 2003. The variance
between these balances was primarily due to increased accruals
and non-current valuation allowances. Our current year and prior
year taxable income are sufficient to realize the benefit of our
Federal deferred tax assets of approximately $67.1 million.
For our state and local taxes and foreign jurisdictions, we
expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are
sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income
needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance
related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $38.7 million as of
July 2, 2004 and $20.1 million as of June 27,
2003. If we continue to operate at a loss in certain
jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future
taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual
effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying
temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be
required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a
significant portion of our



deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial
increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact
on our operating results.

Other Management Estimates

The majority of our revenues and, consequently,
our outstanding accounts receivable, are directly or indirectly
with the U.S. Government. Therefore, our risk of not
collecting amounts due us under such arrangements is minimal. We
generally require letters of credit or deposit payments prior to
the commencement of work or obtain progress payments upon the
achievement of certain milestones from our international
commercial customers. In addition, our revenues are supported by
contractual arrangements specifying the timing and amounts of
payments. We historically have experienced and expect to
continue to experience a minimal amount of uncollectible
accounts receivable. We have not made any material changes in
the methodologies used to determine our allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable during the past three fiscal
years. Changes in the underlying financial condition of our
customers or changes in the industries in which we operate
necessitating revisions to our standard contractual terms and
conditions could have an impact on our results of operations and
cash flows in the future.

We record a liability pertaining to pending
litigation or contingencies based on our best estimate of
probable loss, if any, or at the minimum end of the range of
loss in circumstances where a range of loss can be reasonably
estimated. Because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of
litigation and the cost to us, if any, we continually revise our
estimated losses as additional facts become known. We have not
made any material changes in the methodologies used to estimate
liabilities pertaining to pending litigation during the past
three fiscal years.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

As described in

Note 3: Accounting
Changes

in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
there are accounting pronouncements that have recently been
issued but not yet implemented by us. Note 3 describes the
potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have
on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT
MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe
could cause our actual results to differ materially from
expected and historical results. Other factors besides those
listed here also could adversely affect us.

We participate in markets that are often
    subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it
    difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result,
    future income and expenditures.

We participate in markets that are subject to
uncertain economic conditions. As a result, it is difficult to
estimate the level of growth in some of the markets in which we
participate. Because all components of our budgeting and
forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of future
income and expenditures even more difficult than usual. As a
result, we may make significant investments and expenditures but
never realize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely
affect our results of operations. The future direction of the
overall domestic and global economies will also have a
significant impact on our overall performance.

We depend on the U.S. Government for a
    significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of this
    relationship or a shift in U.S. Government funding could have
    adverse consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the
U.S. Government. Approximately 66 percent,
62 percent and 55 percent of our net revenues in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were derived from
sales to the U.S. Government. Therefore, any significant
disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the
U.S. Government could significantly reduce our revenues.
Our U.S. Government programs must compete with programs
managed by other defense contractors for a limited number of
programs and for uncertain levels of funding. Our competitors
continuously engage in efforts to expand their business
relationships with the U.S. Government and will continue
these efforts in the future. The U.S. Government may choose
to use other contractors for its limited number of defense
programs. In addition, the funding of defense programs also
competes with nondefense spending of the U.S. Government.
Budget decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of
our control and have long-term consequences for our business. A
shift in U.S. Government defense spending to other programs
in which we are not involved, or a reduction in U.S. Government
defense spending generally, could have adverse consequences on
our business.



We depend significantly on our U.S.
    Government contracts, which often are only partially funded,
    subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and
    audited. The termination or failure to fund one or more of these
    contracts could have an adverse impact on our
    business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may
be implemented by the award of many different individual
contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government
programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although
multi-year contracts may be planned or authorized in connection
with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds
on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for
several years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial
funding initially, and additional funds are committed only as
Congress makes further appropriations. The termination of
funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenues attributable to that program. That
could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
funds to a program that already has been started could result in
lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject
to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment of
compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time
of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under these
circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be
able to procure new contracts to offset the revenues lost as a
result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts.
Because a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on
our procurement, performance and payment under our U.S.
Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to
specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic
and other requirements. These requirements, although customary
in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for
a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations
of various statutes, including those related to procurement
integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations,
employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of
records and the recording of costs and foreign corruption. The
termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a
result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our
operations and could have an adverse effect on our reputation
and ability to procure other U.S. Government contracts in the
future.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that
    could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost
    overruns.

Sometimes, we enter into contracts on a firm,
fixed-price basis. During fiscal 2004 approximately
27 percent of our total Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments’ sales were from fixed-price
contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it
carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume
all of the cost risk. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we
can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can
expose us to potentially large losses because the U.S.
Government can compel us to complete a project or, in certain
circumstances, pay the entire cost of its replacement by another
provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost
overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many
of these projects involve new technologies and applications and
can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological
difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials,
problems with other contractors and cost overruns, can result in
the contractual price becoming less favorable or even
unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet
project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
results.

We derive a substantial portion of our
    revenues from international revenues and are subject to the
    risks of doing business in foreign countries, including
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We are highly dependent on sales to customers
outside the United States. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
revenues for products exported from the U.S. or manufactured
abroad were 20 percent, 21 percent and
22 percent, respectively, of our total revenues.
Approximately 39 percent of our international business in
fiscal



2004 was transacted in local currency
environments. Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations
can adversely affect our results. We expect that international
revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of
our total revenues. Also, a significant portion of our
international revenues are in less developed countries. As a
result, we are subject to risks of doing business
internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of
    currency and currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign
    governments relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including
    imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other
    trade restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the
    availability of funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing
    business in many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and
    regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of
    contract and intellectual property rights and occasional
    requirements for onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and
    political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

While these factors or the impact of these
factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could
adversely affect our operations in the future.

Our future success will depend on our
    ability to develop new products that achieve market
    acceptance.

Both our commercial and defense businesses are
characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving
industry standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends
on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our
    target markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our products by adding innovative
    features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Manufacture and bring cost-effective products to
    market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive
in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products,
which will require the investment of significant financial
resources in new product development. The need to make these
expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other
projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures
ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products.
Due to the design complexity of some of our products, we may
experience delays in completing development and introducing new
products in the future. Any delays could result in increased
costs of development or redirect resources from other projects.
In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for
our products will develop as we currently anticipate. The
failure of our products to gain market acceptance could reduce
significantly our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore,
we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop
competing products that gain market acceptance in advance of our
products or that our competitors will not develop new products
that cause our existing products to become obsolete. If we fail
in our new product development efforts or our products fail to
achieve market acceptance more rapidly than those of our
competitors, our revenues will decline and our business,
financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
affected.

We cannot predict the consequences of
    future geo-political events, but they may affect adversely the
    markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against
    risks, our operations or our profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on
September 11, 2001, the subsequent U.S.-led military
response and the potential for future terrorist activities and
other recent geo-political events have created economic and
political uncertainties that could have a material adverse
effect on our business and the prices of our securities. These
matters have caused uncertainty in the world’s financial
and insurance markets and may increase significantly the
political, economic and social instability in the geographic
areas in which we operate. These matters also have caused the
premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase and may
cause some coverages to be unavailable altogether. While our
government businesses have benefited from homeland defense
initiatives and the War on Terrorism, these developments may
affect adversely our business and profitability and the prices
of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time.



We have made, and may continue to make,
    strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
    uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make,
strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired
    businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective
    manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated
    costs or other problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives,
    cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as
    anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to
    be those needed to be successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that
    exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification
    provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying
    parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior
    management from our existing operations.

The inability of our subcontractors to
    perform, or our key suppliers to manufacture and deliver our
    components or products, could cause our products to be produced
    in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage
subcontractors. In addition, there are certain parts or
components, which we source from other manufacturers. Some of
our suppliers from time to time experience financial and
operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to
supply the materials, components and subsystems that we require.
Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a
cost-effective basis could materially impair our ability to
manufacture and deliver our products to customers in a timely
manner. We cannot give assurances that we will not experience
material supply problems or component or subsystems problems in
the future. Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not
be able to maintain the quality of the materials, components and
subsystems they supply, which might result in greater product
returns and could harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Third parties have claimed in the past and
    may claim in the future that we are infringing upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights,
which has resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation.
Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
future that we are infringing their intellectual property
rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to have
infringed those intellectual property rights. We do not believe
that existing claims of infringement will have a material impact
on us; however, we may be unaware of intellectual property
rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products
and services. Claims of intellectual property infringement might
also require us to enter into costly royalty or license
agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or
license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also
may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against
development and sale of certain of our products. Our success
depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on
a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to
establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to
successfully protect and enforce our intellectual property
rights, our competitive position could suffer. Our pending
patent and trademark registration applications may not be
allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of
these patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our
patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and
police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to
detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed
before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our
technology or develop competing technologies.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in
    which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision
    in any such matter could have a material adverse affect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation
matters and are involved in a number of arbitrations. These
actions may divert financial and management resources that would
otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we believe
that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in each and
all of the litigation or arbitration matters to which we are a
party, and intend to contest each lawsuit and proceeding
vigorously, no assurances can be given that the results of these
matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of
these lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse
affect on our financial position.



We are subject to customer credit
    risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term
customer financing. Customer financing arrangements may include
all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and
services, as well as working capital. We also may assist
customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources on
a recourse or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been
able to place a portion of our customer financings with
third-party lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this
risk, a portion of these financings is provided directly by us.
There can be higher risks associated with some of these
financings, particularly when provided to start-up operations
such as local network providers, to customers in developing
countries or to customers in specific financing-intensive areas
of the telecommunications industry. If customers fail to meet
their obligations, losses could be incurred and such losses
could have an adverse effect on us. Our losses could be much
greater if it becomes more difficult to place or insure against
these risks with third parties. We have various programs in
place to monitor and mitigate customer credit risk; however, we
cannot provide assurances that such measures will be effective
in reducing our exposure to our customers’ credit risk.

The fair values of our portfolio of passive
    investments are subject to significant price volatility or
    erosion.

We have investments in securities of several
privately-held companies, many of which still can be considered
in the start-up or developmental stages. These investments are
illiquid and are inherently risky as the markets for the
technologies or products they have under development are
typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We
could lose our entire investment in these companies.

Developing new technologies entails
    significant risks and uncertainties.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to
the products and services we provide. A significant portion of
our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing
advanced defense and technology systems and products. New
technologies associated with these systems and products may be
untested or unproven. Components of certain of the defense
systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous.
Failures of satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control
systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the
potential to cause loss of life and extensive property damage.
In most circumstances we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs from an accident. It also is not possible to
obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and
liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in
excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our insurance
coverage could harm our financial condition and operating
results. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are
liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our
reputation among our customers and the public, thereby making it
more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could
significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
insurance in the future.

We have significant operations in Florida
    that could be impacted in the event of a hurricane and
    operations in California that could be impacted in the event of
    an earthquake.

Our corporate headquarters and significant
operations of our Government Communications Systems Division are
located in Florida. In addition, our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments have locations near major
earthquake fault lines in California. In the event of a major
hurricane, earthquake or other natural disaster we could
experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities
and/or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely
affect our business.

ITEM  7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
    MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are
exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange
rates, fluctuations in the market value of our marketable equity
securities available-for-sale and changes in interest rates. We
employ established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. For
a discussion of such policies and procedures and the related
risks, see “Financial Risk Management” in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated
by reference into this Item 7A.

ITEM  8.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
    SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

    ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM  9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to
the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control
objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end
of fiscal 2004 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the
end of fiscal 2004 our disclosure controls and procedures are
adequate and effective.

(b)

Changes in internal controls:

There have been no changes (including corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses)
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

HARRIS CORPORATION

MELBOURNE, FLORIDA



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Harris Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries as of
July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and comprehensive
income and shareholders’ equity, for each of the three
years in the period ended July 2, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Harris Corporation and
subsidiaries at July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 2, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation —

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.
As used in these notes, the terms “Harris,”
“we,” “our” and “us” refer to
Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated.

Use of Estimates —

These statements have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
and require management to make estimates and assumptions. These
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates are based on experience and other information
available prior to issuance of the financial statements.
Materially different results can occur as circumstances change
and additional information becomes known.

Fiscal Year —

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday
nearest June 30. Fiscal 2004 includes 53 weeks and
fiscal 2003 and 2002 include 52 weeks.

Cash Equivalents —

Cash equivalents are temporary cash
investments with a maturity of three or fewer months when
purchased. These investments include accrued interest and are
carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable securities are stated at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.
Realized gains and losses from marketable securities are
determined using the specific identification method. In
instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an
“other than temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the investment
security recorded on the financial statements and our current
estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in
the period in which the impairment is determined.

The cost basis of marketable securities was
$17.2 million at July 2, 2004 and $22.8 million
at June 27, 2003. The proceeds from the sale of marketable
securities were $7.9 million in fiscal 2004,
$30.1 million in fiscal 2003 and $69.1 million in
fiscal 2002. The amount of realized gains included in
“Non-operating income (loss)” was $2.3 million in
fiscal 2004, $21.2 million in fiscal 2003 and
$60.5 million in fiscal 2002. Included in these realized
gains were write-downs for other than temporary decreases in the
market value of $0.7 million in fiscal 2003 and
$3.7 million in fiscal 2002.

As of July 2, 2004, we had one marketable
security that was in an unrealized loss position. The investment
is in Barclay’s Global Investors S&P 500 Fund, which is
a mutual fund that tracks the Standard and Poors 500 index. As
of July 2, 2004, our carrying value in this investment was
$15.5 million, the market value of the investment was
$12.0 million and the unrealized loss was
$3.5 million. The investment has been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for over 12 months. Based on the
diversified nature of this investment and the Fund’s direct
correlation with the U.S. economy, we believe that this
investment’s carrying amount is recoverable within a
reasonable period of time.

Selected Investments —

Selected investments are equity
investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
estimate the value of the securities without an independent
appraisal based upon available information such as projected
cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
underlying company. In fiscal 2004 “Non-operating income
(loss)” in our Consolidated Statement of Income included a
$5.0 million write-down related to an impairment of our
interest in Teltronics, Inc. In fiscal 2002 “Non-operating
income (loss)” in our Consolidated Statement of Income
included a $10.0 million write-down related to an
impairment of our investment in Terion, Inc. We have
$37.8 million of selected investments at July 2, 2004
and $38.8 million at June 27, 2003 that are included
in the “Other assets” caption in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet, for which we have obtained independent
appraisals. See Note 9: Selected Investments for additional
information regarding selected investments.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments —

The carrying
amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, cost method
investments, receivables, notes receivable and short-term and
long-term debt approximate their fair values. Fair values are
based primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
instruments or independent appraisals. A discussion of fair
values for our derivative financial instruments is included
under the caption “Financial Instruments and Risk
Management” in this Significant Accounting Policies note.

Accounts Receivable —

We record receivables at net
realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated
uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the
accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for
doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our
history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic
status of the customers. See Note 5: Receivables for additional
information.

Inventories —

Inventories are priced at the lower of
cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out methods) or
market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and
record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. See Note 6: Inventories and
Unbilled Costs for additional information regarding inventories.

Plant and Equipment —

Plant and equipment are carried on the
basis of cost. Depreciation of buildings, machinery and
equipment is computed by the straight-line and accelerated
methods. The estimated useful lives of buildings range between 5
and 50 years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and
equipment range between 3 and 10 years. See Note 7:
Plant and Equipment for additional information regarding plant
and equipment.

Income Taxes —

We follow the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets
and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax
jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets
recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation
allowances as required. We regularly review our deferred tax
assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning
strategies. See Note 22: Income Taxes for additional information
regarding income taxes.

Goodwill —

Goodwill represents the excess cost of
a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”), indefinite-life
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as our business segments, with its net book
value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any
unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
reporting unit. See Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for additional information regarding goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Identifiable Intangible Assets —

We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between
the fair value and the carrying amount. See Note 7: Plant
and Equipment and Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for additional information regarding long-lived assets and
identifiable intangible assets.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

Other Accrued Items and Other
Assets —

No accrued
liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other accrued
items” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed
5 percent of our total current liabilities as of
July 2, 2004 and as of June 27, 2003. No current
assets other than those already disclosed on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet exceed 5 percent of our total current assets
as of July 2, 2004 or as of June 27, 2003. No assets
within the caption “Other assets” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet exceed 5 percent of total assets as of
July 2, 2004 or as of June 27, 2003.

Warranties —

On product sales in our RF
Communications, Microwave Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments, we provide for future warranty costs
upon product delivery. The specific terms and conditions of
those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and
country in which we do business. In the case of products sold by
us, our warranties generally start from the delivery date and
continue as follows:

Software products in our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments generally carry a 90-day
warranty from the date of acceptance. Our liability under these
warranties is to provide a corrected copy of any portion of the
software found not to be in substantial compliance with the
agreed upon specifications. This may result in, but does not
guarantee, the customer receiving a free upgrade to a new
release of our software.

Because our products are manufactured, in many
cases, to customer specifications and their acceptance is based
on meeting those specifications, we historically have
experienced minimal warranty costs. Factors that affect our
warranty liability include the number of installed units,
historical experience and management’s judgment regarding
anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We
assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities every
quarter and make adjustments to the liability as necessary.

On long-term contract sales in our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments, the value
or price of our warranty is generally included in the contract
and funded by the customer. A provision is built into the
estimated program costs when determining the profit rate to
accrue when applying the cost-to-cost percentage of completion
revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, if incurred, are
charged to the specific program’s cost and both revenue and
cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the
estimated program cost for warranty include terms of the
contract, number of installed units, historical experience and
management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
warranty claims and cost per claim.

See Note 10: Accrued Warranties for
additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation —

The functional currency for most
international subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange and
income and expense items are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Unearned Compensation —

Compensation resulting from
performance shares granted under our stock incentive plan is
amortized to expense over the performance period and is adjusted
for changes in the market value of our common stock.

Compensation resulting from restricted shares
granted under our stock incentive plan is amortized to expense
over the vesting period based on the price of our common stock
on the grant date.

Stock Options —

In accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” we use the intrinsic-value method of
accounting for stock option awards to employees and,
accordingly, do not recognize compensation expense for our stock
option awards to employees in the Consolidated Statement of
Income.

The following table illustrates the pro forma
effect on net income and earnings per share assuming we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” to all previously granted
stock-based awards after giving consideration to potential
forfeitures. The fair value of each option grant is estimated at
the grant date using the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated
fair value of options granted is amortized to expense over their
vesting period, which is generally three years.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value of options at
their grant date during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2002, where the exercise price equaled the market price on the
grant date, was $9.79, $9.69 and $9.66, respectively. The
weighted average fair values of restricted and performance
shares at their grant date during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002, were $33.14, $31.81 and $29.80, respectively. See
Note 15: Stock Options and Awards for additional
information regarding stock options.

Revenue Recognition

Our segments have the following revenue
recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
segment:

Revenue in our Government
Communications Systems segment primarily relates to long-term
contracts. Recognition of profit on long-term fixed-price
contracts requires estimates of: the contract value or total
contract value; the total cost at completion; and the
measurement of progress towards completion. Revenues and profits
on cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized as allowable costs
are incurred on the contract and become billable to the
customer, in an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the
profit on those costs. Revenue and anticipated profits under
long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion
basis, generally using the cost-to-cost method of accounting
where sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs
incurred to estimated total costs at completion. Contracts are
combined when specific aggregation criteria stated in the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s
Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts” (“SOP 81-1”), are met. Criteria
generally include closely interrelated activities performed for
a single customer within the same economic environment.
Contracts generally are not segmented. If contracts are
segmented, they meet the segmenting criteria stated in
SOP 81-1. Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items are included in sales only when they can
be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or
penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are
considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded
when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated
contract performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or
decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event,
are generally not recognized until the event occurs. When
adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
in progress are charged to earnings when identified.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

RF Communications
segment:

Revenue in our RF
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above except that our
RF Communications segment sometimes uses the units of delivery
method of accounting rather than the cost-to-cost method of
accounting for production contracts that call for the delivery
of larger quantities of products. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Unearned income on service contracts is
amortized by the straight-line method over the term of the
contracts. This segment recognizes revenue when contractual
obligations related to customer acceptance of a product or
service are satisfied.

Microwave Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Microwave
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than on long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. Unearned income
on service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method
over the term of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenues
when contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
other than a long-term contract requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables or elements, such as the
sale of equipment and installation, under a bundled sale, we
determine whether the individual elements represent
“separate units of accounting” under the requirements
of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-21,
“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”
(“EITF 00-21”). If the separate elements meet the
requirements listed in EITF 00-21, we recognize the revenue
associated with each element separately. If the elements within
a bundled sale are not considered separate units of accounting,
the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have
occurred if there are undelivered elements that are essential to
the functionality.

Broadcast Communications
segment:

Revenue in our Broadcast
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue is recognized from sales other than on long-term
contracts when a product is delivered and from services when
performed. Long-term contract sales follow the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. Unearned income
on service contracts is amortized by the straight-line method
over the term of the contracts. This segment recognizes revenue
when contractual obligations related to customer acceptance of a
product or performance are satisfied. Further, if an arrangement
other than a long-term contract requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables or elements, such as the
sale of equipment and installation, under a bundled sale, we
determine whether the individual elements represent
“separate units of accounting” under the requirements
of EITF 00-21. If the separate elements meet the
requirements listed in EITF 00-21, we recognize the revenue
associated with each element separately. If the elements within
a bundled sale are not considered separate units of accounting,
the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have
occurred if there are undelivered elements that are essential to
the functionality.

Other:

Royalty
income is included as a component of “Non-operating income
(loss)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income and is
recognized on the basis of terms specified in contractual
agreements.

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers
are classified on the Consolidated Statement of Income as
“Revenue from product sales and services” and the
associated costs are classified in “Cost of product sales
and services.”

Revenue from services was less than
10 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002.

Retirement Benefits —

As of July 2, 2004, we provide
retirement benefits to substantially all employees primarily
through a defined contribution retirement plan having profit
sharing, matching and savings elements. Contributions by us to
the retirement plan are based on profits and employees’
savings with no other funding requirements. We may make
additional contributions to the plan at our discretion.
Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited healthcare
plan for U.S.-based retirees and employees on long-term
disability. We accrue the estimated cost of these medical
benefits, which are not material, during an employee’s
active service life.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

Retirement plan expense amounted to
$71.8 million in fiscal 2004, $57.3 million in fiscal
2003 and $45.5 million in fiscal 2002.

Environmental Expenditures —

We capitalize environmental
expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. We accrue
environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that
relate to past operations when the costs are probable and
reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party
at 14 sites where future liabilities could exist. These sites
include two sites owned by us, eight sites associated with our
former graphics or semiconductor locations and four treatment or
disposal sites not owned by us that contain hazardous substances
allegedly attributable to us from past operations. Four of the
eight sites associated with our former graphics or semiconductor
sites were sold to Intersil Corporation. Based on an assessment
of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
liability under the Superfund Act and other environmental
statutes and regulations for identified sites, using a
7.5 percent discount rate, is approximately
$4.0 million. This liability is accrued in the July 2,
2004 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate
undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next 20 to
25 years (depending on the number of years for each site)
is approximately $6.4 million. The expected payments for
the next five years are: fiscal 2005 —
$0.4 million; fiscal 2006 — $0.8 million;
fiscal 2007 — $0.5 million; fiscal
2008 — $0.5 million; fiscal 2009 —
$0.4 million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is
approximately $3.8 million. The relevant factors we
considered in estimating our potential liabilities under the
Superfund Act and other environmental statutes include
cost-sharing agreements with other parties and the potential
indemnification from successor and predecessor owners of these
sites. We do not believe that uncertainties with respect to
these relevant factors would materially affect our potential
liability under the Superfund Act and other environmental
statutes.

Financial Guarantees —

Guarantees are contingent commitments
issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper
issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. The terms
of the guarantees are equal to the remaining term of the related
debt, which ranges from one to two years. The maximum potential
amount of future payments we could be required to make under our
guarantees at July 2, 2004 is $1.1 million. At
July 2, 2004, there are no guarantees accrued for in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also hold insurance policies with
third parties to mitigate the risk of loss on a portion of these
guarantees

.

Financial Instruments and Risk
Management —

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”), requires us to recognize all
derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.
Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative
are either offset against the change in fair value of assets,
liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized
in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a
combination of foreign currency call options and foreign
currency forward contracts to hedge against risks associated
with anticipated cash flows that are probable of occurring in
the future and cash flows that are fixed or firmly committed.
These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
used to hedge these cash flows. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge
against the currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated
with anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement 133, such financial instruments are marked-to-market
using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to
other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. The
foreign currency call options and forward contracts are
subsequently recognized as a component of “Cost of product
sales and services” on the Consolidated Statement of Income
when the underlying net cash flows are realized. Unrealized
losses are recorded in “Other accrued items” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. Unrealized
gains are recorded as “Other assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to these financial
instruments, but we do not expect any of the counterparties to
fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, we
select counterparties based on credit ratings, limit our
exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines and
monitor the market position with each counterparty. In the event
of the termination of a derivative designated as a hedge, the
settlement would be charged to the Consolidated Statement of
Income as a component of “Non-operating income (loss).”

Net Income Per Share —

Net income per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
year. See Note 16: Net Income Per Share for additional
information regarding net income per share.

Reclassifications —

Certain prior-year amounts have been
reclassified on the consolidated financial statements to conform
with current year classifications.

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS

On May 28, 2004, we completed the sale of
our tools and test systems (“TTS”) product line, which
was included in our Network Support segment, for approximately
$49.7 million, which is subject to adjustment. As a result
of this transaction, the TTS product line has been reported as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of
land, buildings, equipment, inventory, receivables, technology
and other assets related to the operation of the TTS product
line. A portion of the purchase price ($5 million) was
retained by the buyer until customer acceptance is received on a
large order for an EXP

TM

system. We anticipate that
this hold back will be collected in full from the buyer during
the first half of fiscal 2005. We also anticipate that the final
purchase price will be adjusted downward by approximately
$5 million due to post-closing adjustments. The receivable
related to the hold back and the expected purchase price
adjustment have been reflected as “Other assets” and
“Other accrued items,” respectively, on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2, 2004. We recorded
an after-tax gain on the sale of our TTS product line of
$9.1 million. This gain was net of the disposal of
$13.8 million of related goodwill.

Summarized financial information for our
discontinued operations is as follows:

The information set forth in the other Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to continuing
operations unless otherwise specified.

NOTE 3: ACCOUNTING
CHANGES

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation Number
46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”). This interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” provides guidance for identifying a
controlling interest in a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) established by means other than voting
interests. FIN 46 also requires



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

consolidation of a VIE by an enterprise that
holds such a controlling interest. In December 2003, the FASB
completed its deliberations regarding the proposed modification
to FIN 46 and issued Interpretation Number 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46R”).
The decisions reached included a deferral of the effective date
and provisions for additional scope exceptions for certain types
of variable interests. Application of FIN 46R is required in
financial statements of public entities that have interests in
VIEs or potential VIEs commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003.
Application by public entities (other than small business
issuers) for all other types of entities is required in
financial statements for periods ending after March 15,
2004. We adopted FIN 46R beginning in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, “Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“Statement 149”). Statement 149
amends and clarifies the definition of a derivative, expands the
nature of exemptions from Statement 133, clarifies the
application of hedge accounting when using certain instruments,
clarifies the application of Statement 133 to embedded
derivatives and modifies the cash flow presentation of
derivative instruments containing financing elements. Statement
149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. We adopted Statement 149 beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In July 2003, the FASB’s Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue 03-5,
“Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2
“Software Revenue Recognition” (“SOP 97-2”)
to Non-Software Deliverables” (“EITF 03-5”). The
consensus was reached that non-software deliverables are
included within the scope of SOP 97-2 if they are included in an
arrangement that contains software that is essential to the
non-software deliverables’ functionality. This consensus is
to be applied to fiscal periods beginning after August 13,
2003. We adopted EITF 03-5 beginning in the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003),
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits” (“Revised Statement
132”). Revised Statement 132 revises employers’
required disclosures about pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions,” No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits” and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions” (“Statement 106”). Revised
Statement 132 requires disclosures in addition to those in the
original FASB Statement No. 132. Revised Statement 132 is
effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2003. The interim-period disclosures
required by Revised Statement 132 are effective for interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2003. We adopted
Revised Statement 132 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal
2004 and it did not have a material impact on our financial
statements or related footnotes.

In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position
No. 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP 106-1”), with an
effective date for fiscal years ending after December 7,
2003. FSP 106-1 relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”)
signed into law on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare. We do not believe that we would need to amend our
postretirement health care plan in order to benefit from the
federal subsidy. As permitted by FSP 106-1, we made a one-time
election to defer accounting for the effect of the Act until
specific authoritative guidance is issued. Therefore, in
accordance with FSP 106-1, any measures of the accumulated
postretirement obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit
cost included in our financial statements do not reflect the
effects of the Act on our plans. We do not believe, however,
that the federal subsidy or the authoritative guidance on how to
account for the federal subsidy, when issued, will have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF
03-1”). EITF 03-1 requires disclosures on investments in an
unrealized loss position. The disclosures are designed to help
financial statement users analyze



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

a company’s unrealized losses and to enable
them to better understand the basis for any management
conclusion that the impairment is temporary. Quantitative and
qualitative disclosures for investments accounted for under FASB
Statement No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities,” are effective for the first
annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. All
new disclosures related to cost method investments are effective
for the annual reporting periods ending after June 15,
2004. Comparative information for the periods prior to the
period of initial application is not required. We have made
these required disclosures in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004.

In April 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position 129-1, “Disclosure Requirements under FASB
Statement No. 129, Disclosure of Information about Capital
Structure, Relating to Contingently Convertible Financial
Instruments” (“FSP 129-1”). FSP 129-1 states that
FASB Statement 129 “Disclosure of Information about Capital
Structure” (“Statement 129”) applies to all
contingently convertible securities, including those containing
contingent conversion requirements that have not been met and
are not otherwise required to be included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 128, “Earnings per Share.” Paragraph 4
of Statement 129 requires the disclosure of significant terms of
the conversion features of the contingently convertible security
to enable users of financial statements to understand the
circumstances of the contingency and the potential impact of
conversion. Disclosures are to indicate whether the shares that
would be issued if the contingently convertible securities were
converted are included in the calculation of diluted earnings
per share, and the reasons why or why not. The guidance in FSP
129-1 is effective immediately upon posting of the final FSP
129-1 to the FASB website and applies to all existing and newly
created securities. We adopted FSP 129-1 beginning in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003. See Note 16: Net Income Per Share for
these disclosures.

At its June 30 – July 1, 2004
meeting on EITF Issue No. 04-8, “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per
Share,” the Task Force tentatively concluded that
contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted
earnings per share computations using the if-converted method
regardless of whether the market price trigger (or other
contingent feature) has been met, which would represent a
significant change in current practice. At its July 16,
2004 meeting, the FASB did not object to: (1) the EITF
continuing to deliberate Issue 04-8; (2) the posting on the
FASB’s website of a draft EITF abstract on Issue 04-8,
subject to a 45-day comment period (the draft Abstract was
posted to the website on Monday, July 19, 2004); or
(3) the FASB staff including in the draft abstract a
request for comment on whether the tentative conclusion should
be expanded to include other instruments that are convertible
into common stock after a contingency has been resolved. Issue
04-8 will be discussed further by the EITF at its
September 29-30, 2004 meeting. As currently drafted, the
effective date for EITF 04-08 would be reporting periods ending
after December 15, 2004. The current draft of EITF 04-8
also requires restatement of earnings per share amounts for
prior periods presented. If the provisions of the current EITF
04-08 draft are approved, we estimate that adopting EITF 04-08
would have had a $.04 negative impact to our fiscal 2004 income
from continuing operations per diluted common share.

NOTE 4: BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS

On June 30, 2001, which was in fiscal 2002,
we purchased the assets of Hirschmann Multimedia Communications
Network (“Hirschmann”). This acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
the results of operations of Hirschmann have been included in
the Consolidated Statement of Income since the date of
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effect of this acquisition was not
material. We paid cash in the net amount of $8.6 million
for Hirschmann. The Hirschmann acquisition resulted in goodwill
of $14.3 million. Hirschmann is being operated within our
Broadcast Communications segment.

NOTE 8: GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for
the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, by
business segment, are as follows:

We have other identifiable intangible assets
related primarily to technology acquired through acquisition.
The unamortized other identifiable intangible assets, included
in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
were $10.1 million at July 2, 2004 and
$18.6 million at June 27, 2003. Accumulated
amortization related to other identifiable intangibles was $7.3
million at July 2, 2004 and $5.4 million at
June 27, 2003. Our other identifiable intangible assets are
being amortized over their useful economic lives, which range
from four years to 17 years. The weighted average useful
life of our other identifiable intangible assets is
12.6 years. Amortization expense related to other
identifiable intangible assets was $2.1 million in fiscal
2004, $1.7 million in fiscal 2003 and $1.7 million in
fiscal 2002. The estimated amortization expense for the five
fiscal years following fiscal 2004 is: $1.9 million in
fiscal 2005, $1.5 million in fiscal 2006, $1.3 million
in fiscal 2007, $1.3 in fiscal 2008, $1.2 in fiscal 2009 and
$2.9 million thereafter.

NOTE 9: SELECTED
INVESTMENTS

We have equity investments in technology
companies, which are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting. These investments are included in the “Other
assets” caption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These
selected investments are summarized below:

In addition to the equity investments noted above
we also have notes receivable from Terion, Inc.
(“Terion”) and Teltronics, Inc.
(“Teltronics”) of $8.2 million and
$5.0 million, respectively.

Terion is a privately held company that is a
wireless data communication and information solution provider
for mobile and remote business-to-business applications focusing
on the transportation industry. It has sold units to customers
such as J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and XTRA Lease,
a division of XTRA Corporation. None of Terion’s revenue is
generated from Harris or its affiliates. We have invested
technology and cash in Terion since fiscal 1994 and we currently
nominate one member of Terion’s five member board of
directors. The maximum exposure to loss we have with our debt
and equity interest in Terion is $29.9 million.

AuthenTec, Inc. (“AuthenTec”) is a
privately held company that provides advanced biometric
fingerprint sensors to the PC, wireless, PDA, access control and
automotive markets. AuthenTec has shipped over one million of
its TruePrint® technology-based sensors to several
customers in a multitude of countries worldwide.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

AuthenTec’s revenues generated from Harris
or its affiliates have not been material. We have invested
technology and cash in AuthenTec since 1998 and we currently
nominate one member of AuthenTec’s board of directors. The
maximum exposure to loss we have with our interest in AuthenTec
is $16.1 million.

The equity investment in Teltronics is
Series C Preferred Stock, which is convertible into
Teltronics’ common stock. In no case will this
Series C Preferred Stock be exercisable for more than
19.9 percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Teltronics’ capital stock that are entitled to
vote. Teltronics is a publicly held company that is traded on
the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol
“TELT.” Teltronics is a global provider of
communications solutions with revenues of $47 million in
calendar 2003. Teltronics’ revenues generated from Harris
or its affiliates have not been material. On June 30, 2000
we sold certain equipment, inventory and intellectual property
rights related to our 20-20® switching technology and
associated products from our telecom switch business to
Teltronics in exchange for a promissory note, a portion of which
was converted to Series C Preferred Stock in March 2002
under a Master Restructuring Agreement. We do not nominate any
members of the Teltronics’ board of directors. The maximum
exposure to loss we have with our debt and equity interest in
Teltronics is $5.0 million.

NOTE 10: ACCRUED
WARRANTIES

Changes in our warranty liability, which is
included as a component of “Other accrued items” on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, during fiscal 2004 and 2003 are
as follows:

NOTE 11: CREDIT
ARRANGEMENTS

We have a committed Revolving Credit Agreement
that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to
$300 million. This credit facility expires in October 2007.
Each bank’s obligation to make loans to us under this
credit facility is subject to, among other things, the accuracy
of our representations and warranties and our compliance with
various covenants. Interest rates on borrowings under this
credit facility and related fees are determined by a pricing
matrix based upon our long-term debt rating assigned by Standard
and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s Investors
Service. The availability of borrowing under this credit
facility is not contingent upon our debt rating. We are not
required to maintain compensating balances in connection with
this agreement. While we did not issue commercial paper in 2004,
availability of borrowings under this revolving credit facility
enables us to issue commercial paper. The financial covenants
contained in this credit facility include, among others,
maintenance of consolidated tangible net worth of not less than
$842.6 million (which amount is subject to adjustment),
maintenance of a total debt to adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio of not more
than 3.0 to 1 and maintenance of an adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest
charges ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1 for four trailing
quarters. This credit facility also includes negative covenants
limiting (i) the creation of liens or other encumbrances,
(ii) certain sale and leaseback transactions, and
(iii) certain sales or other dispositions of assets other
than in the ordinary course of business. In addition, this
facility includes certain provisions for acceleration of
maturity in the case of a (a) “cross default” with
other indebtedness in an amount in excess of $50 million,
(b) final uninsured judgment in excess of $50 million
which remains unpaid or discharged, or (c) change of
control, including if a person or group of persons acquires more
than 25 percent of our voting stock.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we filed
a “universal shelf” registration statement with the
SEC related to the potential future issuance of up to
$500 million of securities, including debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock, fractional interests in preferred
stock represented by depositary shares and warrants to purchase
debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. This universal
shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC
during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and replaces our prior
$500 million debt shelf registration.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit
aggregating $32.9 million from various U.S. and
international banks, of which $27.1 million was available
on July 2, 2004. These lines provide for borrowings at
various interest rates, typically may be terminated upon notice,
may be used on such terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and
us and are reviewed annually for renewal or modification. We
have a short-term commercial paper program in place, which we
may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. There were
no borrowings under the commercial paper program at July 2,
2004. These lines do not require compensating balances.

NOTE 12: SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $9.4 million at
July 2, 2004 and $31.2 million at June 27, 2003
is entirely made up of notes payable to banks in both years.
Bank notes with Brazilian banks amounted to $4.8 million at
July 2, 2004 with a weighted-average interest rate of
17.1 percent and $4.5 million at June 27, 2003
with a weighted-average interest rate of 24.3 percent. The
weighted-average interest rate for bank notes other than those
with Brazilian banks was 4.0 percent at July 2, 2004
and at June 27, 2003.

NOTE 13: LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt includes the following:

The other long-term debt to banks at
June 27, 2003, was interest free. The potential maturities
of long-term debt, including the current portion, for the five
years following fiscal 2004 are: $0.5 million in fiscal
2005; none in fiscal 2006; $1.4 million in fiscal 2007;
$300.0 million in fiscal 2008; none in fiscal 2009; and
$100.0 million thereafter. These potential maturities take
into consideration the possibility that the debt holders will
exercise put options for our 3.5% Convertible Debentures and
6.35% debentures in August 2007 and February 2008, respectively.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private
placement of $150 million of our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures due 2022. The debentures are unsecured obligations
convertible, in certain instances, into shares of our common
stock at an initial conversion price of $45.25 per share,
subject to adjustment. The debentures were issued at
100 percent of the principal amount, less a discount of
2.5 percent to the initial purchasers. We may redeem the
debentures commencing August 2007 at 100 percent of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may require us
to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in part, on specified
dates in 2007, 2012 and 2017 or upon the occurrence of certain
other events at 100 percent of the principal amount plus
accrued interest. The debentures bear interest at an annual rate
of 3.5 percent. The interest rate will be reset in August
2007, 2012 and 2017, but in no event will it be reset below
3.5 percent or above 5.5 percent per annum. We
incurred $4.8 million in debt issuance costs related to the
issuance of the convertible debentures, which costs are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period and
reflected as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

NOTE 14: PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE
RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, we declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share
of common stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by the common stock share certificates,
trade with the common stock until they become exercisable, and
entitle the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
Participating Preferred Stock for $125, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of 10 business
days (or such later date fixed by our Board of Directors) after
a party commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire a
beneficial interest of at least 15 percent of our
outstanding common stock, or the first date of public
announcement by us that a person has acquired a



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

beneficial interest of at least 15 percent
of our outstanding common stock, or such later date fixed by our
Board of Directors.

Upon the first date of public announcement by us
that a person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding common stock, or such later
date fixed by our Board of Directors, each right (other than
rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any
affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the holder to
purchase shares of our common stock having a market value equal
to twice the exercise price of the right. In addition, each
right (other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring
person or any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the
holder to exercise the right and receive shares of common stock
of the acquiring company, upon a merger or other business
combination, having a market value of twice the exercise price
of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights
become exercisable, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange
all of the then outstanding rights for shares of common stock at
an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right,
subject to adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and
may be redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $.01 per
right at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial
interest of 15 percent of the outstanding common stock.

NOTE 15: STOCK OPTIONS AND
AWARDS

The following information relates to stock option
and incentive stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent
of market value on the date the options are granted. Option
grants are for a maximum of 10 years after dates of grant
and become exercisable in installments.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, we
use the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option
awards granted to employees and, accordingly, do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Price ranges of outstanding and exercisable
options at July 2, 2004 are summarized below:

We have stock incentive plans for directors and
employees. Awards under these plans may include the grant of
performance shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock
appreciation rights or other stock-based awards. Restricted
shares outstanding under our stock incentive plan were 111,666
at July 2, 2004, 125,000 at June 27, 2003 and none at
June 28, 2002. Performance shares outstanding under our
stock incentive plan were 200,000 at July 2, 2004, 169,833
at June 27, 2003, and 167,000 at June 28, 2002. Shares
of common stock reserved for

future awards under the stock incentive plan were
6,594,187 at July 2, 2004, 7,613,616 at June 27, 2003,
and 8,503,111 at June 28, 2002.

Total compensation expense recognized from
restricted and performance shares during fiscal 2004, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002 was $5.6 million, $2.5 million and
$3.6 million, respectively. The value of restricted stock,
equal to the intrinsic value at the time of grant, is amortized
as compensation expense over the vesting period. The value of
performance shares, equal to the most probable estimate of the
intrinsic value at the time of distribution, is amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period.

Under our domestic retirement plans, most
employees may select an option to invest in Harris’ common
stock at 70 percent of current market value limited to one
percent of their compensation, which is matched. The discounts
from fair market value on common stock purchased by employees
under the domestic retirement plans are charged to compensation
expense in the period of the related purchase.

NOTE 16: NET INCOME PER
SHARE

Average outstanding shares used in the
computation of net income per share are summarized below:

In fiscal 2003 we issued $150 million of
3.5% Convertible Debentures due fiscal 2023. Holders of the
debentures have the right to convert each of their debentures
into shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity
under any of the following circumstances:

•

During any calendar quarter if the closing sale
    price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the
    30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day
    of the previous calendar quarter, is more than 110 percent
    of the applicable conversion price per share of our common stock
    on such last trading day,

•

Debentures called for redemption may be
    surrendered for conversion until the close of business on the
    business day immediately preceding the redemption date,

•

During any period that the long-term credit
    rating assigned to the debentures by either of Moody’s
    Investors Service Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Group is at or below Ba1 or BB+, respectively, or if the
    debentures no longer are rated by either of these ratings
    services, or if the ratings for the debentures have been
    suspended by either of these ratings services, or

•

Upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions, including if we make a significant distribution to
    holders of our common stock or if we are a party to specified
    consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all
    of our properties and assets.

For each $1,000 of debentures surrendered for
conversion, a holder will receive 22.0994 shares of our common
stock. This represents an initial conversion price of $45.25 per
share of our common stock based on the issue price of the
debentures. The conversion rate may be adjusted for certain
reasons.

None of the shares that would be issued upon the
conversion of our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due fiscal 2023
are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
above because none of the circumstances noted above that could
result in conversion existed during any portion of the periods
presented above.

NOTE 17: RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product
development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs were
$111.3 million in fiscal 2004, $99.8 million in fiscal
2003 and $104.9 million in fiscal 2002.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs
are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are
accounted for principally by the percentage-of-completion
method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require us to
provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance
or other specifications (such as designs). Customer-sponsored
research and development were $729.9 million in fiscal
2004, $499.9 million in fiscal 2003 and $412.3 million in
fiscal 2002. Customer-sponsored research and development is
included in our revenues and cost of product, sales and services.

NOTE 18: INTEREST
EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $24.5 million in
fiscal 2004, $24.9 million in fiscal 2003 and
$26.7 million in fiscal 2002. Interest attributable to
funds used to finance major long-term construction projects can
be capitalized as an additional cost of the related asset. No
interest was capitalized in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 or fiscal
2002. Interest paid was $23.6 million in fiscal 2004,
$23.7 million in fiscal 2003 and $29.4 million in
fiscal 2002.

NOTE 19: LEASE
COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to
$20.7 million in fiscal 2004, $20.4 million in fiscal 2003,
and $22.1 million in fiscal 2002. Future minimum rental
commitments under leases with an initial lease term in excess of
one year, primarily for land and buildings, amounted to
approximately $64.8 million at July 2, 2004. These
commitments for the years following fiscal 2004 are: fiscal
2005 — $18.7 million; fiscal
2006 — $14.3 million; fiscal
2007 — $11.2 million; fiscal
2008 — $8.4 million; fiscal
2009 — $4.9 million; and $7.3 million
thereafter.

NOTE 20: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND
HEDGING ACTIVITY

We use foreign exchange contracts and options to
hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign
currency commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange
contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and
purchase commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable from
and future committed sales to customers and intercompany loans.
We believe the use of foreign currency financial instruments
should reduce the risks that arise from doing business in
international markets. At July 2, 2004, we had open foreign
exchange contracts with a notional amount of $93.9 million,
of which $30.0 million were classified as cash flow hedges
and $63.9 million were classified as fair value hedges.
This compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a
notional amount of $95.7 million as of June 27, 2003,
of which $18.1 million were classified as cash flow hedges
and $77.6 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
July 2, 2004, contract expiration dates range from less
than one month to 18 months with a weighted average contract
life of 0.2 years.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts
classified as cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge
currency exposures from cash flows anticipated from the Bowman
program in our RF Communications segment. This contract for our
tactical radio products was awarded in the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. Under the contract, the customer pays in Pounds
Sterling. We have hedged the forecasted cash flows related to
payments made to the U.S. operations to maintain our anticipated
profit margins. We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to
suppliers to maintain our anticipated profit margins in the U.K.
operations. As of July 2, 2004 we estimated that a pretax
loss of $3.2 million would be reclassified into earnings
from comprehensive income within the next 18 months related
to the cash flow hedges for the Bowman program. The amount of
pretax loss that would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income from the other transactions we are hedging
with cash flow hedges was not material as of July 2, 2004.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 representing the amount of fair value and
cash flow hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No
amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 related to the component of the derivative
instruments’ gain or loss excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amounts were recognized in
our earnings in fiscal 2004, 2003

and 2002 related to hedged firm commitments that
no longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of these derivatives
were recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet in
accordance with Statement 133.

NOTE 21: NON-OPERATING INCOME
(LOSS)

The components of non-operating income
(loss) are as follows:

NOTE 22: INCOME
TAXES

The provisions for income taxes are summarized as
follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

The components of deferred income tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory United States
income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows:

United States income taxes have not been provided
on $395.0 million of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest
these earnings. The determination of unrecognized deferred U.S.
tax liability for the undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and credit
carryforwards as of July 2, 2004, have expiration dates
ranging between one year and no expiration in certain instances.
The amount of domestic, international and state and local tax
loss carryforwards as of July 2, 2004 was
$24.7 million, $39.8 million and $185.7 million,
respectively. Pre-tax income (loss) of international
subsidiaries was $49.6 million in fiscal 2004, $(23.9)
million in fiscal 2003 and $1.2 million in fiscal 2002.
Income taxes paid were $52.7 million in fiscal 2004,
$23.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $20.7 million in
fiscal 2002. The valuation allowance increased
$18.6 million from $20.1 million in fiscal 2003 to
$38.7 million in fiscal 2004. The valuation allowance has
been established for financial reporting purposes, to offset
certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due to
uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the future.

NOTE 23: BUSINESS
SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we
serve and operate in four business segments — Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications. We changed our
segment reporting structure effective May 28, 2004, in
conjunction with the sale of our TTS product line. The TTS
product line was formerly part of the Network Support segment,
which was eliminated as a separate reportable segment as a
result of the sale. Our Government Communications Systems
segment engages in advanced research and develops, designs and
produces advanced communication and information processing
systems. Our RF Communications segment performs advanced
research and develops, designs, manufactures and sells secure
tactical radio products and provides services related to secure
tactical radio products. Our Microwave Communications segment
designs, manufactures and sells microwave radio products;
develops, designs, produces and sells network management
systems; and provides services related to these products. Our
Broadcast Communications segment designs, manufactures and sells
television and radio



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

transmission products; develops, designs,
produces and sells automation and control systems and studio
products; and provides services related to these products and
systems.

Our products and systems are produced principally
in the United States with international revenues derived
primarily from exports. No revenues earned from any individual
foreign country exceeded 4 percent of our total revenue
during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2002.

The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in Note 1: Significant
Accounting Policies. We evaluate each segment’s performance
based on its “operating income or loss,” which we
define as profit or loss from operations before income taxes
excluding interest income and expense, equity income, goodwill
amortization and gains or losses from securities and other
investments. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, intersegment sales
were transferred at prices comparable to those provided to
unaffiliated customers. In fiscal 2004, intersegment sales were
transferred at cost to the buying division and the sourcing
division recognized a normal profit that was eliminated. This
change in the intersegment policy resulted in an elimination of
intercompany profit, which was $7.3 million in fiscal 2004.
The “Corporate eliminations” line item in the charts
below represents the elimination of intersegment sales and their
related profits. “Headquarters expense” represents the
portion of corporate expenses not allocated to the business
segments or discontinued operations.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all
segments (primarily our Government Communications Systems
segment and our RF Communications segment) as a percent of total
revenues were 65.5 percent in fiscal 2004,
62.4 percent in fiscal 2003 and 55.2 percent in fiscal
2002.

Selected information by business segment and
geographical area is summarized below:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
— (Continued)

Headquarters assets consist primarily of cash,
marketable securities, plant and equipment, net assets of
discontinued operations and selected investments. Depreciation
and amortization includes identifiable intangible assets and
debt issuance costs amortization of $3.7 million,
$3.2 million and $2.5 million in fiscal 2004, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively.

Export revenues were $308.6 million in
fiscal 2004, $222.7 million in fiscal 2003 and
$179.9 million in fiscal 2002. Export revenues and revenues
of international operations were principally from Europe,
Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

Revenue and income from continuing operations
before income taxes by segment follows:

Fiscal 2003 Microwave Communications
    segment’s operating loss includes an $8.6 million
    write-down of inventory related to the exit from unprofitable
    products and the shut-down of its Brazilian manufacturing plant,
    as well as $8.3 million of expenses related to
    cost-reduction measures. Broadcast Communications segment’s
    operating income and corporate headquarters expense includes
    $4.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of
    expenses related to cost-reduction measures. Headquarters
    expense also includes a $12.4 million charge related to our
    disposal of assets remaining from our telecom switch business.
    Non-operating (loss) income includes an $18.8 million gain
    on the sale of our minority interest in our LiveTV, LLC joint
    venture.

Fiscal 2002 Microwave Communications
    segment’s operating loss includes a $15.8 million
    charge related to cost-reduction actions taken in its
    international operations and collection losses related to the
    bankruptcy of a customer in Latin America. Non-operating income
    (loss) includes a $10.3 million gain from the sale of our
    minority interest in our GE Harris Energy Control Systems, LLC
    joint venture, and a $10.0 million write-down of our
    investment interest in Terion, Inc.

NOTE 24: LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, as a normal incident of the
nature and kind of businesses in which we are engaged, various
claims or charges are asserted and litigation commenced against
us arising from or related to: product liability; personal
injury; patents, trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee
disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
products containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or
environmental matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but
may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the
claim or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral
awards. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
matters with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings
may be disposed or decided unfavorably to us, based upon
available information, in the opinion of management, settlements
and final judgments, if any, which are considered probable of
being rendered against us in existing litigation or arbitration
are reserved for, covered by insurance or would not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

We previously filed a patent infringement claim
against Ericsson, Inc. in the U. S. Federal District Court
for the Northern District of Texas. On October 29, 2002, a
jury rendered a verdict in our favor against Ericsson, Inc. and
its parent company. The jury awarded us approximately
$61 million in compensatory damages and found that
Ericsson’s conduct was “willful.” Following such
verdict, we filed a motion to enhance the damages based upon the
finding of willfulness, and Ericsson filed motions: (i) to
decrease the damage award, (ii) to order a new trial, and
(iii) for non-infringement and invalidity of the relevant
patent notwithstanding the jury’s verdict. On July 17,
2003, the Court issued a ruling on these motions denying
Ericsson’s motions for non-infringement and invalidity of
the patent, but did rule that unless we agreed to a lowered
damage award of $43 million in compensatory damages, it was
granting Ericsson’s motion for a new trial on the issue of
damages. We agreed to the lowered damages and thus, a judgment
was entered for us in the amount of $43 million plus
$1 million for enhanced damages and $1 million for
attorneys’ fees, as well as pre-judgment interest, which we
currently estimate to be approximately $8 million. During
the second quarter of fiscal 2004, Ericsson appealed the
judgment of the District Court. We have filed a cross appeal
seeking to increase the amount of enhanced damages. The briefing
for the appeal was completed in the second quarter of fiscal
2004. Furthermore, since the amount of damages, if any, which we
may receive cannot be determined until the legal process is
complete, no gain has been recorded in our Consolidated
Statement of Income related to this matter.

NOTE 25: SUBSEQUENT
EVENT

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we acquired
The Orkand Corporation (“Orkand”), a privately-held,
leading provider of technical services and information
technology for U.S. Government agencies including the
Department of State, Department of Labor, Department of the
Interior, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
Energy and the U.S. Postal Service. The purchase price was
$66 million cash, which is subject to post-closing
adjustments. The amount of consideration to the former
shareholders and option holders of Orkand was paid out of
interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents.
