PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is an
    international communications and information technology company
    serving government and commercial markets in more than 150
    countries. We are dedicated to developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets, including
    RF communications, government communications and broadcast
    communications.

Harris Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the
    successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard,
    Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is

(321) 727-9100.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “HRS.” On August 28, 2009, we employed
    approximately 15,300 people. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
    “us,” “Company” and “Harris” as
    used in this Report refer to Harris Corporation and its
    subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report our
    financial results in the following three business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of our
    (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National Intelligence
    Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and (iv) IT Services
    businesses; and

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Transmission Systems
    businesses.

As previously reported and as discussed further in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report (the
    “Notes”), our segment reporting structure for fiscal
    2009 reflects that, effective upon the commencement of fiscal
    2009, our RF Communications business (part of our Defense
    Communications and Electronics segment for fiscal 2008) is
    reported as its own separate segment, and our Defense Programs
    business (the other part of our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment for fiscal 2008) is reported as part of
    our Government Communications Systems segment. Our Broadcast
    Communications segment did not change as a result of those
    adjustments to our segment reporting structure. The historical
    results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as
    set forth in this Report reflect the impact of those adjustments
    to our segment reporting structure for all periods presented in
    this Report.



Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in
    connection with the May 27, 2009 spin-off (the
    “Spin-off”) in the form of a taxable pro rata dividend
    to our shareholders of all the shares of Harris Stratex
    Networks, Inc. (“HSTX”) common stock owned by us, we
    eliminated as a reporting segment our former HSTX segment.
    Accordingly, our historical financial results have been restated
    to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in this Report, and unless otherwise specified,
    disclosures in this Report relate solely to our continuing
    operations. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

in
    the Notes for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or
    “Non-operating income (loss)” line items in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent
    Acquisitions

Acquisition of Crucial Security, Inc.

On
    April 15, 2009, we acquired Crucial Security, Inc.
    (“CSI”), a privately held 110-employee
    Washington, D.C.-area provider of mission-enabling
    engineering solutions that address both offensive and defensive
    information technology (“IT”) security challenges for
    Federal law enforcement and other U.S. Government agencies.
    We operate CSI within our Government Communications Systems
    segment as part of the National Intelligence Programs business.
    The acquisition expands our capabilities, customer footprint and
    current initiatives in the cyber security market.

Acquisition of Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems
    Business.

On May 29, 2009, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless
    systems business (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known
    as M/A-COM), an established provider of mission-critical
    wireless communications systems for law enforcement, fire and
    rescue, public service, utility and transportation markets. In
    connection with the acquisition, we assumed liabilities
    primarily related to Wireless Systems. We did not assume the
    State of New York wireless network contract awarded to Wireless
    Systems in December 2004. The purchase price for Wireless
    Systems was $665 million in cash, subject to further
    post-closing adjustments. We operate Wireless Systems, which we
    now call the Public Safety and Professional Communications
    business, within our RF Communications segment. We believe the
    acquisition creates a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the growing $9 billion global
    land mobile radio systems market and greatly accelerates our
    entry into that market.

Acquisition of SolaCom Technologies ATC
    Business.

On June 19, 2009, we acquired the
    50-employee Air Traffic Control business unit (“SolaCom
    ATC”) of SolaCom Technologies Inc., a privately held
    company headquartered in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. SolaCom ATC
    provides voice and data communications systems and solutions for
    air traffic facilities and radio communications between aircraft
    in flight and air traffic controllers. These next-generation
    radio control equipment solutions provide extremely reliable
    voice switching and conferencing capabilities used by more than
    100 customers on six continents. We operate SolaCom ATC within
    our Government Communications Systems segment as part of the
    Civil Programs business. We believe the acquisition provides our
    Civil Programs’ Mission Critical Networks business, a
    leader in air traffic control communications networks and
    telecommunications infrastructure, with an immediate ability to
    address additional segments of the air traffic control
    voice/data systems market and further positions us to support
    the anticipated Next Generation Air Transportation System
    (“NextGen”) program of the Federal Aviation
    Administration (“FAA”).

Financial
    Information About Our Business Segments

Financial information with respect to our business segments,
    including revenue, operating income or loss and total assets,
    and with respect to our operations outside the United States, is
    contained in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the Notes
    and is incorporated herein by reference.

Description
    of Business by Segment

RF
    Communications

RF Communications is a global supplier of secure tactical radio
    communications and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for
    military and government organizations and also of secure
    communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility
    and transportation markets. RF Communications is comprised of
    our (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses.

Tactical Radio Communications:

We design,
    develop and manufacture a comprehensive line of secure radio
    communications products and systems for manpack, handheld,
    soldier-worn, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
    applications that operate in various radio frequency
    bands — high-frequency (“HF”), very
    high-frequency (“VHF”) and ultra high-frequency
    (“UHF”) — over satellite communications
    (“SATCOM”) and in multiband mode.



These radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and
    capable of supporting diverse mission requirements. Our
    Falcon

®

family of tactical radios is built on a software-defined radio
    platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software
    upgrades. Our Falcon radios also have the highest grade embedded
    encryption and provide highly mobile, secure and reliable
    network communications capability without relying on a fixed
    infrastructure. This capability allows warfighters, for example,
    to remain connected with each other, their command structures
    and support organizations, and gives them the ability to
    communicate information and maintain situational awareness of
    both friendly and opposing forces, which are critical to both
    the safety and success of their missions.

Unlike many of our competitors in the U.S. Government
    market, we operate this business on a “commercial”
    customer and market-driven business model, as opposed to a
    government programs-driven business model. This means that we
    anticipate market needs, invest our internal research and
    development resources to develop products sooner than
    government-funded programs, build to our internal forecast, and
    provide

ready-to-ship,

commercial,

off-the-shelf

(“COTS”) products to customers more quickly than
    customers can typically obtain similar products under
    government-funded programs.

Our Falcon
    III

®

family of radios is the next generation of multiband,
    multi-mission tactical radios, which supports the
    U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System
    (“JTRS”) requirements as well as network-centric
    operations worldwide. Our Falcon III radios address the
    full range of current mission and interoperability requirements
    and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical
    standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in
    our Falcon III radios include extended frequency range,
    significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous
    generations and programmable encryption. We have shipped more
    than 75,000

JTRS-approved

Falcon III radios.

Our Falcon III multiband handheld radio, the AN/PRC-152(C)
    (“152C”), is the world’s most widely deployed
    JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio and was our first
    Falcon III radio to be fielded. It has been widely fielded
    by all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense
    (“DoD”) and many allies worldwide, and is also used by
    U.S. Federal agencies. The 152C offers users a wide range
    of capabilities such as legacy Single Channel Ground and
    Airborne System (“SINCGARS”) interoperability; UHF

ground-to-ground

line-of-sight

communications;

close-air

support; tactical SATCOM; and the Association of Public Safety
    Communications Officials — International
    (“APCO”) P25 waveform to provide direct communications
    with first responders. The 152C also serves as the
    handheld-based transceiver of our Falcon III AN/VRC-110, a
    high-performance, multiband vehicular system that offers the
    added feature of easy vehicle dismount — a

“grab-and-go”

feature that delivers continuous communications when removed
    from the vehicle, an important capability in urban environments.

Our new Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G
    (“117G”), is the only JTRS-approved and National
    Security Agency (“NSA”) Type-1 certified radio
    providing wideband networking capability. It has been deployed
    to all branches of the DoD and is enabling the transition to a
    networked battlefield communications environment. High-bandwidth
    applications include simultaneous voice, data and streaming
    video for situational awareness, reconnaissance information and
    biometrics. The radio delivers Internet Protocol
    (“IP”) data to the tactical Internet at on-air rates
    of up to 5 megabits per second. The 117G currently runs our
    Advanced Networking Wideband Waveform (“ANW2”) and is
    designed for future upgrade to the Soldier Radio Waveform
    (“SRW”). Both waveforms provide advanced networking
    capability to the battlefield. The 117G features an extended
    frequency range from 30 megahertz to 2 gigahertz and is
    significantly lighter and consumes less power than previous
    generations of manpack radios. It is certified by the Joint
    Interoperability Test Command (“JITC”) as compliant
    with Demand Assigned Multiple Access (“DAMA”) military
    standards and is upgradeable to access the Mobile User Objective
    System (“MUOS”), both of which are used for
    transmitting high-bandwidth voice and data over tactical
    military satellites. The 117G includes a Remote Operated Video
    Enhanced Receiver (“ROVER”) interoperable mode that
    provides warfighters on the battlefield with the ability to
    receive live video directly from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (“UAVs”). This capability allows users to receive a
    video feed directly from the UAV without an intermediary or
    having to pass that information from a base station, which
    enables a dismounted warfighter to carry only one radio in
    situations where two radios were previously required.

Our cryptographic solutions encompass NSA-certified products and
    systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems, including our
    Sierra

®

and
    Citadel

®

embedded encryption solutions and our SecNet

®

and SecNet

tm

IP communications families of communications security
    (“COMSEC”) terminals.

In the international market, our tactical radios are the
    standard of NATO and Partnership for Peace countries and are
    sold to more than 100 countries through our strong international
    distribution channels consisting of regional sales offices and a
    broad dealer network. International tactical radio demand is
    being driven by continuing tactical communications modernization
    and standardization programs to provide more sophisticated
    communications capabilities to address traditional and emerging
    threats and to provide interoperability. In fiscal 2009, we
    received



tactical radio orders from,

and/or

made
    deliveries to, a wide range of international customers including
    Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Belgium, Belize, Brunei, Canada,
    the Czech Republic, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia,
    Ethiopia, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kenya,
    Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Mexico, Mozambique, Niger, Norway,
    Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, the Republic of Georgia,
    Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Uganda, Ukraine, the United
    Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Additionally, we are increasing our focus on providing
    integrated communications systems for the international market.
    Our integrated systems offerings are largely based on our
    products, but include other companies’ products, as well as
    a wide variety of applications, in order to implement integrated
    command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
    surveillance and reconnaissance (“C4ISR”) systems for
    many different types of platforms, including command post and
    transit case systems, vehicular and shelter communications
    systems and specialized airborne applications, which are
    frequently used in border security and surveillance systems. For
    example, we are providing for the United Arab Emirates Ministry
    of Defense a mobile, airborne and fixed-secure command, control
    and communications (“C3”) nationwide system with 40
    ground sites connected by an

IP-based

radio communications network, integrating
    Falcon II

®

HF, VHF and multiband radios and Falcon III high capacity
    data radios and tactical broadband global area network
    (“BGAN”) terminals for SATCOM. We are providing the
    Pakistan Frontier Corps with a complete turnkey secure,
    high-speed communications infrastructure system, including
    Falcon II HF and VHF radios, wideband high capacity line of
    sight (“HCLOS”) radios and Falcon
    Watch

tm

unmanned ground sensors, in fixed, mobile and shelterized
    installations. In addition, we are providing to Brunei a
    nationwide complete integrated communications military system
    covering 18 static sites, 4 repeater sites and 288 vehicle
    installations, with Falcon II HF and VHF radios and
    Falcon III secure personal radios.

Public Safety and Professional
    Communications:

We supply assured communications
    systems and equipment for public safety, utility and
    transportation markets, with products ranging from complete

end-to-end

wireless network infrastructure solutions, including advanced IP
    voice and data networks, supporting multiple platforms and
    providing interoperability among disparate systems, to portable
    and mobile single-band and multiband radios.

We acquired Wireless Systems on May 29, 2009, as described
    under “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report. As a result of that
    acquisition, we conduct a worldwide wireless network systems
    business which designs, builds, distributes, maintains and
    supplies wireless communications systems, including land mobile
    radio and broadband equipment, systems and networks for the
    public safety, utility and transportation markets. We offer our
    Voice, Interoperability, Data and Access (“VIDA”)
    network solution, which is a unique, cost-effective

IP-based

network that is flexible, responsive, expandable and easily
    upgradeable, and which supports a full line of communications
    systems, including OpenSky, NetworkFirst,
    P25

IP

and

    Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
    (“EDACS”), allowing seamless interconnection of
    diverse systems. Our VIDA network solutions currently serve as
    the backbone in some of the largest and most advanced statewide
    and regional communications networks in North America, including
    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

In addition to a full range of single-band land mobile radio
    terminals from the Wireless Systems acquisition, we offer our
    multiband portable radio, the
    Unity

tm

XG-100. The Unity XG-100 covers all portable land mobile radio
    frequency bands in a single radio; operates on APCO Digital P25
    conventional and trunked systems; is backwards compatible with
    analog FM systems; and includes advanced capabilities, such as
    an internal Global Positioning System (“GPS”) receiver
    for situational awareness, internal secure
    Bluetooth

®

wireless technology, and background noise suppression features.
    Our Unity multiband radio is designed to allow Federal agencies
    to talk with each other as well as their counterparts at the
    state and local level, thus providing a significant improvement
    over most current radio systems for U.S. public safety,
    which are not interoperable, requiring emergency personnel to
    carry multiple radios or route transmissions through ad-hoc
    network bridges, often configured at the time of an emergency,
    and creating instances where agencies responding to a common
    incident cannot talk to each other.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the RF Communications segment increased 17 percent to
    $1,761 million in fiscal 2009 compared with
    $1,507 million in fiscal 2008, and was $1,179 million
    in fiscal 2007. Segment operating income increased
    9 percent to $571.5 million in fiscal 2009 compared
    with $525.5 million in fiscal 2008, and was
    $403.2 million in fiscal 2007. The RF Communications
    segment contributed 35 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 32 percent in fiscal 2008 and
    31 percent in fiscal 2007. The percentage of this
    segment’s revenue that was derived outside of the United
    States was 39 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with
    27 percent in fiscal 2008 and 28 percent in fiscal
    2007. U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through
    prime contractors, accounted for approximately 79 percent
    of this segment’s total revenue in fiscal 2009 compared
    with approximately 82 percent in fiscal 2008 and
    76 percent in fiscal 2007. For a general description of our
    U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a
    discussion of revenue generated from cost-



reimbursement versus fixed-price contracts, see
    “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
    Government Contracts” of this Report.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through
    regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
    See “Item 1. Business — International
    Business” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $922 million at July 3, 2009 compared with
    $982 million at June 27, 2008 and $797 million at
    June 29, 2007. We expect to fill approximately
    67 percent of this funded backlog during fiscal 2010, but
    we can give no assurance of such fulfillment. Additional
    information regarding this segment’s funded backlog is
    provided under “Item 1. Business — Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating

Government
    Communications Systems

Government Communications Systems conducts advanced research
    studies and produces, integrates and supports highly reliable,
    net-centric communications and information technology that solve
    the mission-critical challenges of our defense, intelligence and
    civilian U.S. Government customers, and is comprised of our
    (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National Intelligence
    Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and (iv) IT Services
    businesses.

Defense Programs:

We develop, supply and
    integrate communications and information processing products,
    systems and networks for a diverse base of aerospace,
    terrestrial and maritime applications supporting DoD missions,
    and we are committed to delivering leading-edge technologies
    that support the military’s ongoing transformation to
    network-centric communications. Our technologies are providing
    advanced battlespace networking capabilities to assure timely
    and secure network-centric capabilities across strategic,
    operational and tactical boundaries in support of the DoD’s
    full spectrum of warfighting, intelligence and logistics
    missions. Our major technology capabilities include SATCOM
    terminals for transportable ground, fixed-site and shipboard
    applications; flat-panel and phased-array antennas; aviation
    electronics for military jets and helicopters, including radios,
    digital maps, modems, sensors, data buses, fiber optics and
    microelectronics; high-speed data links and data networks for
    wireless communications and smart weapons; and advanced ground
    control systems. For example, our mobile ad hoc networking
    capability allows the military to take its communications
    infrastructure with it, creating mobile, self-forming and
    self-healing networks across the battlefield. Our Highband
    Networking
    Radio

tm

(“HNR”), released in fiscal 2007, provides secure,
    wireless, high-bandwidth (30 megabits per second),

on-the-move

communications among users of widely dispersed local area
    networks (“LANs”) by establishing

line-of-sight

connectivity using a Harris-developed waveform that
    automatically selects the best communications path available,
    allowing seamless communication of voice, video and data to all
    levels of command. We announced in fiscal 2009 that our HNR
    system was deployed to the U.S. Army 101st Airborne
    Division (Air Assault) 2nd Brigade Combat Team in Iraq,
    which was the first combat deployment of the HNR system.

Examples of ongoing programs for us include the following:

•

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“F-35”), F-22 Raptor
    and

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet aircraft platform programs, for which we provide
    high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber
    optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image
    processing, digital map software and other electronic
    components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link
    (“MADL”) communications subsystems primarily intended
    for stealth platform

air-to-air

communications and which allow F-35s to communicate in a stealth
    fashion with other network nodes without revealing their
    positions;

•

The Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (“WIN-T”)
    program for the U.S. Army, for which we are designing and
    testing the wireless transmission system architecture, applying
    our proven enabling technologies for wireless

on-the-move

communications, including phased arrays and high-speed secure
    wireless network solutions such as our HNR system;

•

The Multiple Launch Rocket System (“MLRS”) Improved
    Fire Control System (“IFCS”) program for the
    U.S. Army, for which we provide the launcher interface
    unit, power switching unit and weapon interface unit;



•

The Multiband Shipboard Satellite Communications Terminal
    (“MSSCT”) program for the U.S. Navy, for which we
    are providing wideband SATCOM terminal systems. During fiscal
    2009, we were awarded a contract modification, potentially worth
    $37 million, to supply MSSCTs for the Arleigh Burke class
    of guided missile destroyers; and

•

The Commercial Broadband Satellite Program (“CBSP”)
    for the U.S. Navy, for which we supply broadband multiband
    SATCOM terminals that support essential mission requirements and
    provide enhanced

morale-related

communications services such as high-speed Internet access and
    video communications.

During fiscal 2009, we were awarded a

ten-year

contract, potentially worth $600 million, for the
    U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals
    (“MET”) program, under which the next-generation large
    satellite earth stations we develop will provide the worldwide
    backbone for high-priority military communications and missile
    defense systems and support IP and Dedicated Circuit
    Connectivity within the Global Information Grid
    (“GIG”), providing critical reach-back capability for
    the warfighter.

National Intelligence Programs:

A significant
    portion of this business involves classified programs. While
    classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report,
    the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe
    that the business risks associated with those programs do not
    differ materially from the business risks of other
    U.S. Government programs.

We are a major developer, supplier and integrator of
    communications and information processing products, systems and
    networks for a diverse base of U.S. Intelligence Community
    programs, and we support the ongoing transformation of the
    Intelligence Community into a more collaborative enterprise.
    Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency
    customers, including NSA and the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (“NGA”), we provide
    intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”)
    solutions that improve situational awareness, data collection
    accuracy and product analysis by correlating near real-time
    mission data and intelligence reference data for display and
    analysis by strategic and tactical planners and decision makers.
    Our ISR systems help to integrate information across the analyst
    workflow, accelerating the movement of information that has been
    collected and processed. We strive to produce innovative ISR
    solutions that provide our customers with information dominance
    for battle-space superiority.

For example, our image processing capabilities extend from
    algorithm development through delivery of operations systems,
    and we are providing advanced image exploitation and
    dissemination solutions for ISR applications by advancing image
    processing, image data fusion, display technologies and digital
    product generation techniques. Those technologies range from new
    techniques for merging and displaying imagery to automated
    techniques for image screening, cueing and remote visualization.
    Also, our mapping and visualization capabilities provide
    complete, accurate and timely knowledge about the threat, the
    terrain, the status and the location of single or multiple foe
    and friendly forces and their support by utilizing data,
    pictures, voice and video drawn from vast storage banks or from
    real-time input which can be transmitted around the world in
    fractions of a second. In addition, we have industry-leading
    capabilities in the architecture, design and development of
    highly specialized satellite antennas, structures, phased arrays
    and on-board processors, which are used to enable
    next-generation satellite systems to provide the
    U.S. military and intelligence communities with strategic
    and tactical advantages. We are also a leader in the design and
    development of antenna and reflector technologies for commercial
    space telecommunications applications. Further, our capabilities
    include developing and supplying

state-of-the-art

wireless voice and data products and solutions spanning
    vehicular, man-portable, airborne, remote/unattended and

system-level

applications for both passive and active missions, including
    surveillance and tracking equipment, for the
    U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement community.

During fiscal 2009, we were awarded a number of new contracts
    and follow-on contracts under classified programs. In fiscal
    2009, we also expanded our capabilities, customer footprint and
    current initiatives in the cyber security market through our
    April 15, 2009 acquisition of CSI, as described under
    “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report. As an industry-leader in
    cyber security, we have been using

state-of-the-art

technology assessment techniques and architecture engineering
    for decades to define and operate secure networks supporting
    nationally critical programs. We currently support three of the
    nation’s largest secure networks: (i) the FAA
    Telecommunications Infrastructure (“FTI”) program
    network, (ii) the global communications and information
    systems (“Patriot” program) network for the National
    Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”), and (iii) the
    Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (“NMCI”) program network.
    Our technology countermeasures and monitoring capabilities
    proactively safeguard vital information assets supporting the
    missions of U.S. military, intelligence, transportation and
    commerce customers. In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal
    2009, we signed an agreement with McAfee, Inc., a large
    dedicated enterprise security technology company, to resell its
    products and technical services to the U.S. Government.



Civil Programs:

We provide highly reliable,
    mission-critical communications and information processing
    systems that meet the most demanding needs of customers in the
    U.S. civilian Federal market, including the FAA, Census
    Bureau, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (“NOAA”) and Department of Health and Human Services
    (“HHS”). We use our ability to implement and manage
    large, complex programs that integrate secure, advanced
    communications and information processing technologies in order
    to improve productivity and information processing and to
    achieve cost savings for our customers. Our networks and
    information systems for large-scale, geographically dispersed
    enterprises offer advanced capabilities for collecting,
    processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying, distributing,
    storing and retrieving data.

For example, we are the prime contractor under a

15-year

contract, awarded in July 2002 that is potentially worth
    $3.5 billion, for the FTI program to integrate, modernize,
    operate and maintain the communications infrastructure for the
    U.S. air traffic control system. FTI is a modern, secure
    and efficient network providing voice, data and video
    communications deployed at more than 4,500 sites across the
    U.S., to enhance network efficiency, reliability and security
    and improve service while reducing operating costs. We designed
    and deployed the FTI network and it is fully operational. The
    FTI network consists of the Operations Network, the Mission
    Support Network and the Satellite Network. The supporting
    infrastructure includes the Network Operations Control Centers
    (“NOCCs”) and Security Operations Control Centers
    (“SOCCs”). The FTI program expanded in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009 to include the FTI Microwave program,
    which will provide replacement of the FAA’s legacy low
    density radio control link (“LDRCL”) network. Our
    acquisition of SolaCom ATC on June 19, 2009 as described
    under “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report provides us with an immediate
    ability to address additional segments of the air traffic
    control voice/data systems market and further positions us to
    support the FAA’s anticipated NextGen program.

The U.S. Census Bureau is also a significant customer.
    Under the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated
    Geographic Encoding and Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project
    (“MTAIP”), which was completed in fiscal 2008, we were
    the prime contractor modernizing two key census databases
    containing 175 million addresses for all
    U.S. residences and businesses and a database linking
    U.S. streets, rivers, railroads and other geographic
    features to GPS coordinates. The Field Data Collection
    Automation (“FDCA”) program was awarded to us during
    fiscal 2006 in support of the 2010 census. We are the prime
    contractor integrating multiple automated systems, and we also
    developed a wireless handheld device with integrated GPS and
    secure communications capabilities designed to enable census
    takers to input data in real time and securely transmit the
    information back to the Census Bureau. The FDCA program is
    nearing completion, and revenue from the program will decline
    significantly in fiscal 2010.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we were awarded a ten-year
    contract, potentially worth $736 million, to provide a
    complete,

end-to-end

solution for NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellite — Series R Ground Segment (“GOES-R
    GS”) program, under which we will design, develop, deploy
    and operate the ground segment system, which will receive and
    process satellite data and generate and distribute weather data
    to more than 10,000 direct users. We will also provide the
    command and control of operational satellites under the GOES-R
    GS program.

In a new growth initiative for us — Healthcare
    Solutions — we are focusing on delivering
    standards-based interoperable healthcare solutions for
    government and commercial clients with security, privacy and
    patients in control of how their information is shared. For
    example, we are developing and integrating, under a contract
    from HHS, an open-source National Health Information Network
    (“NHIN”) CONNECT Gateway solution designed to enable
    seamless health information sharing among multiple Federal
    agencies and regional healthcare providers. We are developing a
    multi-hospital military health network with image-sharing
    capabilities under the DoD Military Health System global
    Healthcare Artifact and Image Management Solution
    (“HAIMS”) program. We also are providing Health First,
    Inc. (“Health First”), a Florida-based healthcare
    provider, with network management and IT services for its
    enterprise-wide operations under a significant ten-year contract.

IT Services:

We use our engineering and
    integration expertise to rapidly design, build and support

mission-critical

communications and IT solutions, as both a prime contractor and
    a subcontractor, for U.S. Government defense, civilian and
    national intelligence customers and for commercial customers in
    cyberspace, healthcare and new media markets. With approximately
    3,000 highly specialized, highly trained and appropriately
    certified employees at approximately 300 locations worldwide, we
    support large-scale, mission-critical networks, which often
    require the highest level of availability and security, with
    technical expertise and strong customer commitment through the
    full technology lifecycle, including network design, deployment,
    operations and ongoing support. Our operational footprint in the
    U.S. offers a physical presence in all 50 states and
    provides support to more than 9,000 customer sites in the 200
    largest cities. Our capabilities and services comprise three
    main solution areas, namely IT transformation, managed services
    and information assurance.



Our IT transformation solutions use a holistic approach built on
    proven methodologies in order to design, implement and manage
    enterprise-wide architectures that align IT goals with
    customers’ business and mission goals. Our standards-based,
    repeatable IT transformation solutions unify, streamline and
    modernize unwieldy and disparate networks and systems across
    distributed environments, resulting in highly simplified,
    flexible, secure and manageable network infrastructures.

Our managed services solutions include outsourced staffing and
    infrastructure, sustained by comprehensive operations and
    maintenance offerings, and are based on a flexible, scalable and
    repeatable service level agreement (“SLA”)
    performance-driven business model, frequently in a fixed-price
    environment. Our managed services solutions use an Information
    Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL”)-based
    best-practices approach for optimizing and supporting IT and
    communications environments, improving efficiencies, lowering
    operational costs and allowing customers to focus on mission
    performance.

Our information assurance solutions include architecture
    analysis; attack warning and defense; identity management;
    security assessments; certification and accreditation process
    support; forensics analysis and vulnerability remediation;
    system anomaly monitoring, detection and management; and
    physical security countermeasures. Our information assurance
    solutions safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and
    availability of enterprise infrastructures, systems and critical
    business data over the full IT lifecycle, from infrastructure
    design to integration and testing to operations and maintenance.
    Those solutions meet widely used certification and accreditation
    standards, including the Federal Information Security Management
    Act (“FISMA”), the National Security Agency/Center
    Security Services Information System Certification and
    Accreditation Process (“NISCAP”) and the Department of
    Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
    Process (“DIACAP”).

As examples, for NRO, which designs, builds and operates U.S.
    reconnaissance satellites, we provide operations, maintenance
    and support services for its Patriot program network in space
    and on the ground under a ten-year contract awarded in August
    2004, potentially worth $1 billion, in support of
    NRO’s global analyst community. We are providing the
    U.S. Navy with comprehensive,

end-to-end

support for data, video and voice communications for over
    700,000 users as a Tier One subcontractor under the NMCI
    program awarded in October 2000 and potentially worth
    $1.1 billion. The NMCI program is the largest IT
    outsourcing managed services contract ever awarded by the
    U.S. Government. Under a

five-year

contract awarded by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of
    Consular Affairs (the “State 6” program) in August
    2008, potentially worth $217 million, we provide IT
    integration of installation, training, help desk, passport and
    configuration management services in support of more than
    230 U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. We
    also provide system maintenance and engineering for the Defense
    Information Systems Agency’s (“DISA”) Crisis
    Management System, and we provide ongoing mission operations and
    support services under the FTI program.

Additionally, under the Network and Space Operations and
    Maintenance (“NSOM”) program contract awarded to us in
    January 2008 for a six-month base period with six one-year
    options, potentially worth $410 million in aggregate, we
    provide operations and maintenance support at locations around
    the world for the communications functions for the U.S. Air
    Force 50th Space Wing’s Satellite Control Network
    (“AFSCN”), a global, continuously operational network
    of ground stations, operational control nodes and communications
    links that support launch and command and control of various
    space programs managed by the DoD and other national security
    space organizations.

We also have key positions on a number of Indefinite
    Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts. We
    are a prime contractor under the U.S. Air Force Network
    Centric Solutions (“NETCENTS”) contract, which
    provides IT installation, integration and operations and
    maintenance services for networks and systems and offers IT
    products for networks. Our NETCENTS task orders include the
    Maxwell Air Force Base and the Overseas Navy Enterprise Network

(“ONE-NET”).

We are also a prime contractor under the U.S. Army ITES-2S
    contract, which provides IT installation, integration,
    infrastructure and operations and maintenance services for
    networks and systems. Our ITES-2S task orders include the
    Fort Bliss Department of Information Management
    (“DOIM”), the Army G-1 support and the Army.mil
    website and content support. We are one of 59 prime contractor
    awardees under the ALLIANT Government-Wide Acquisition Contract
    (“GWAC”) for the General Services Administration
    (“GSA”), which is an IT procurement contract broadly
    accessible to all U.S. Government agencies.

In a new growth initiative for us — Commercial Managed
    Services — we are providing

end-to-end

solutions and services across our vertical commercial markets,
    including cyberspace, healthcare and “new media”
    broadcast markets. For example, we are providing Health First
    with managed services for back office infrastructure and
    networks. We also are collaborating with the Broadcast
    Communications segment to design and manage systems that manage,
    monitor and play out video content for a branded TV channel for
    the McDonald’s fast food chain and systems that combine IP
    television (“IPTV”) and digital signage and IT
    infrastructure to create an advanced media workflow for an
    in-arena network for the Orlando Magic’s new basketball
    arena, as described in more detail below under
    “Item 1. Business — Description of Business
    by Segment — Broadcast Communications” of this
    Report.



Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the Government Communications Systems segment increased
    9 percent to $2,710 million in fiscal 2009 compared
    with $2,478 million in fiscal 2008, and was
    $1,997 million in fiscal 2007. Segment operating income
    increased 34 percent to $302.8 million in fiscal 2009
    compared with $226.0 million in fiscal 2008, and was
    $225.6 million in fiscal 2007. This segment contributed
    54 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 compared
    with 54 percent in fiscal 2008 and 53 percent in
    fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2009, approximately 28 percent of
    the revenue for this segment was under contracts with prime
    contractors and approximately 72 percent of revenue was
    under direct contracts with customers, compared with
    approximately 26 percent of revenue under contracts with
    prime contractors and approximately 74 percent of revenue
    under direct contracts with customers in fiscal 2008 and
    approximately 29 percent of revenue under contracts with
    prime contractors and approximately 71 percent of revenue
    under direct contracts with customers in fiscal 2007. Some of
    this segment’s more significant programs in fiscal 2009
    included the FDCA program, the FTI program, the Patriot program,
    the NETCENTS program, the NMCI program and various classified
    programs. The largest program by revenue for fiscal 2009
    represented approximately 13 percent of this segment’s
    revenue in fiscal 2009, compared with approximately
    9 percent in fiscal 2008 and approximately 12 percent
    in fiscal 2007. The 10 largest programs by revenue for fiscal
    2009 represented approximately 46 percent of this
    segment’s revenue in fiscal 2009, approximately
    45 percent in fiscal 2008 and approximately 38 percent
    in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2009, this segment had a diverse
    portfolio of over 300 programs. Historically, that diversity has
    provided a stable backlog and reduced potential risks that come
    from reductions in funding or changes in customer priorities,
    and we expect that program diversity will continue to provide
    similar benefits in the future, although we can give no
    assurance. In fiscal 2009, U.S. Government customers,
    including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as
    well as foreign military sales through the U.S. Government,
    whether directly or through prime contractors, accounted for
    approximately 96 percent of this segment’s total
    revenue compared with approximately 96 percent in fiscal
    2008 and 95 percent in fiscal 2007. For a general
    description of our U.S. Government contracts and
    subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated from
    cost-reimbursement versus fixed-price contracts, see
    “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
    Government Contracts” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $398 million at July 3, 2009 compared with
    $371 million at June 27, 2008 and $372 million at
    June 29, 2007. Unfunded backlog for this segment was
    $4,750 million at July 3, 2009 compared with
    $4,225 million at June 27, 2008 and
    $4,265 million at June 29, 2007. We expect to fill
    approximately 95 percent of this funded backlog during
    fiscal 2010, but we can give no assurance of such fulfillment.
    Additional information regarding funded and unfunded backlog for
    this segment is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Funded and Unfunded Backlog” of this
    Report. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this
    segment, including risks relating to our U.S. Government
    contracts and subcontracts, see “Item 1.
    Business — Principal Customers; Government
    Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Broadcast
    Communications

Broadcast Communications supplies technology and service
    solutions to consumers of rich media, including TV stations
    and networks and cable, satellite, telecommunications and other
    media content providers. Recently, our efforts have expanded to
    include government customers, sports and entertainment
    organizations, restaurants, casinos and theme parks, that use
    broadcast and digital signage technologies to drive messaging
    and advertising to their customers. Those solutions are designed
    to receive content in any format and then manage, move and
    reformat that content for any delivery network to any viewing
    device. Broadcast Communications’ hardware and software
    products, systems and services offer a comprehensive,
    single-source approach to delivering interoperable workflow
    capabilities and solutions spanning the entire broadcast value
    chain, including content creation, management, distribution and
    delivery. The Harris
    ONE

tm

solution for interoperable workflows that depend on IT-centric
    systems, integrated infrastructure and enterprise software
    brings together highly integrated and cost-effective products
    suited for emerging media business models and for customers
    upgrading media operations to digital and high definition
    (“HD”) services from analog and standard definition
    (“SD”) services. This segment serves the global
    digital and analog media markets, providing infrastructure and
    networking products and solutions, media and workflow solutions,
    and television and radio transmission equipment and systems.

The current trend and future of broadcast media involves
    digitizing content and transporting it simultaneously over many
    different networks to many types of devices. The need to create,
    manage and ultimately deliver digital media content is driving
    an infrastructure upgrade cycle for the media industry. However,
    the global recession, particularly the weak economic conditions
    in North America, has prompted many broadcast and media
    customers to postpone capital spending projects, and we expect
    the North America market to remain weak for at least the next
    several quarters. We also expect the impact of lower revenue on
    this segment’s operating performance to be mitigated by its
    ongoing cost-reduction and margin improvement actions. We are
    supporting customers as they



expand services for HD television (“HDTV”), IPTV,

video-on-demand

and interactive TV. The introduction of several new products has
    established Broadcast Communications as a provider of

end-to-end

solutions for the worldwide transition to digital and HD
    technologies and infrastructure, including three gigabit per
    second (“3 Gb/s”) solutions for the 1080p HD format.

Transmission Systems:

We develop, manufacture
    and supply digital and analog television and radio transmission
    systems for delivery of rich media over wireless broadcast
    terrestrial networks on a worldwide basis, including mobile TV
    applications. We can provide single products or

end-to-end

systems, including nationwide networks with hundreds of
    transmitters. Our television and radio transmission systems
    solutions are scalable to meet the needs of broadcasters of all
    sizes. We are a leader in television’s transition from
    analog to digital technology and in technology for the
    U.S. digital standard known as “ATSC” and the
    European digital standard “DVB-T.” We continue to play
    a leading role in assisting local television broadcasters and
    network operators to implement transmission solutions, including
    solutions based on ATSC and DVB-T and other digital standards
    and all major approaches to broadcast mobile TV. In fiscal 2007,
    we introduced with LG Electronics Inc. the jointly developed
    Mobile Handheld in-band mobile digital TV system
    (“M/H”), a new technology capable of providing digital
    TV (“DTV”) signals and extending

over-the-air

broadcast TV signals beyond customary TV viewing at home to
    mobile, pedestrian and other handheld devices (such as mobile
    phones or laptop computers). Our products also include our
    Maxiva

tm

line of UHF multimedia transmitters, comprised of our Maxiva ULX
    Series of liquid-cooled transmitters for high-power UHF
    multimedia broadcasters and our Maxiva UAX Series of air-cooled,
    solid-state transmitters for low-power UHF transmission.

We are also a leader in the transition from analog to digital
    radio. Our product offerings address the U.S. digital
    standard called “IBOC” (In-Band/On-Channel), which is
    referred to in the market as “HD
    Radio

®

,”

    as well as international digital standards including
    “DAB” and “DRM.” Our radio transmission
    products include our
    Intraplex

®

line of audio transport products, including

studio-to-transmitter

links, and our
    FLEXSTAR

tm

family, which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so
    broadcasters can offer supplemental audio and data capability
    along with the main program stream, offering listeners 5.1
    surround sound, on-demand traffic, weather and sports reports,

store-and-play

capabilities and real-time navigation.



This segment has several new growth initiatives underway. We
    offer digital transmitters, encoding equipment and the ability
    to launch new channels with an overall solution consisting of ad
    sales, automation, servers, master control and branding for
    mobile TV applications. We are collaborating with the Government
    Communications Systems segment’s IT Services business to
    design and manage (i) systems featuring digital signage
    solutions with IT infrastructure to manage, monitor and play out
    digital broadcast-quality video content for the McDonald’s
    fast food chain’s branded TV channel under a field trial
    including 20 restaurants around the U.S. and
    (ii) systems that combine IPTV and digital signage
    solutions that merge broadcast technology with IT infrastructure
    in order to create an innovative file-based advanced media
    workflow for an in-arena network for the Orlando Magic’s
    new basketball arena. We also offer, for U.S. Government
    customers, our Full-Motion Video Asset Management Engine
    (“FAME

tm

”)

    capability. FAME is a COTS-based solution developed based on our
    digital asset management technologies, input from intelligence
    analysts and our Government Communications Systems
    segment’s image processing, system integration and security
    capabilities.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the Broadcast Communications segment decreased
    9 percent to $584 million in fiscal 2009 compared with
    $643 million in fiscal 2008, and was $600 million in
    fiscal 2007. The segment had an operating loss of
    $238.0 million in fiscal 2009, which included a
    $255.5 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill
    and other long-lived assets, compared with operating income of
    $33.8 million in fiscal 2008 and $11.9 million in
    fiscal 2007. The Broadcast Communications segment contributed
    11 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 compared
    with 14 percent in fiscal 2008 and 16 percent in
    fiscal 2007. The percentage of this segment’s revenue that
    was derived outside of the United States was approximately
    47 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with 47 percent in
    fiscal 2008 and 46 percent in fiscal 2007. No single
    customer accounted for more than 3 percent of fiscal 2009
    revenue for the Broadcast Communications segment.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through
    regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
    See “Item 1. Business — International
    Business” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $247 million at July 3, 2009 compared with
    $305 million at June 27, 2008 and $298 million at
    June 29, 2007. We expect to fill approximately
    50 percent of this backlog during fiscal 2010, but we can
    give no assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, see “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Report.

International
    Business

Revenue from products exported from the United States (including
    foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad was
    $1,016.6 million (20 percent of our total revenue) in
    fiscal 2009 compared with $759.7 million (17 percent
    of our total revenue) in fiscal 2008 and $629.6 million
    (17 percent of our total revenue) in fiscal 2007. Our
    international sales include both direct exports from the United
    States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Essentially all of
    the international sales are derived from the RF Communications
    and Broadcast Communications segments. Direct export sales are
    primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas sales from
    foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local
    currency of the subsidiary. Exports from the United States,
    principally to Europe, Africa, Canada, Latin America, the Middle
    East and Asia, totaled $766.0 million (approximately
    75 percent of our international revenue) in fiscal 2009
    compared with $530.5 million (approximately 70 percent
    of our international revenue) in fiscal 2008 and
    $404.0 million (approximately 64 percent of our
    international revenue) in fiscal 2007. The percentage of revenue
    represented by foreign operations was 5 percent in fiscal
    2009 compared with 5 percent in fiscal 2008 and
    6 percent in fiscal 2007. The percentage of long-lived
    assets represented by foreign operations was 12 percent as
    of July 3, 2009 compared with 19 percent as of
    June 27, 2008 and 19 percent as of June 29, 2007.
    Financial information regarding our domestic and international
    operations is contained in

Note 25: Business
    Segments

in the Notes and is incorporated herein by
    reference.

Our principal international manufacturing facilities are located
    in Canada and the United Kingdom. The majority of our
    international marketing activities are conducted through
    subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
    America, and Asia. We have also established international
    marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
    Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
    Registrant” of this Report for further information
    regarding our international subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
    distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
    sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
    and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
    for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the



independent representative and may be above or below our list
    prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a
    discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in
    setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. Revenue
    from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2009 represented
    11 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    55 percent of our international revenue, compared with
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2008 representing
    7 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    44 percent of our international revenue, and revenue from
    indirect sales channels in fiscal 2007 representing
    8 percent of our total revenue and 40 percent of our
    international revenue.

Fiscal 2009 international revenue came from a large number of
    countries, and no such single country accounted for more than
    3 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are
    paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either
    on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments,
    progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or
    upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
    Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to
    provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in
    international markets, we also sometimes enter into recourse and
    vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain
    customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
    Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
    mitigated by the diversification of the international business
    and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance
    payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
    management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are product quality and reliability;
    technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability
    to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability
    to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party
    sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.
    Within the IT services market, there is intense competition
    among many companies. The ability to compete in the IT services
    market depends on a number of factors, including the capability
    to deploy skilled professionals at competitive prices across the
    diverse spectrum of the IT services market.

In the RF Communications segment, principal competitors include
    European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company N.V.
    (“EADS”), General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Motorola,
    Raytheon, Rohde & Schwarz, Selex, Tadiran and Thales.

In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal
    competitors include Boeing, CACI, General Dynamics, GTSI, L-3
    Communications, Lockheed Martin, ManTech, NCI, Northrop Grumman,
    Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, SRA, Stanley and SAIC. Consolidation
    among U.S. defense and aerospace companies has resulted in
    a reduction in the number of principal prime contractors. As a
    result of this consolidation, we frequently “partner”
    or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
    companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
    programs.

In the Broadcast Communications segment, principal competitors
    include Avid, Broadcast Electronics, Chyron, Evertz, Harmonic,
    Miranda, Nautel, NEC, Omneon, Omnibus, Pilat Media,
    Rohde & Schwarz, Sony Broadcast, Tektronix, Thomson
    and Wide Orbit, as well as other smaller companies and divisions
    of large companies. We believe that our broad product offering
    and total content delivery solutions are key competitive
    strengths for this segment.

Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through
    prime contractors, were 79 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 79 percent in fiscal 2008 and
    75 percent in fiscal 2007. No other customer accounted for
    more than 1 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2009.
    Additional information regarding customers for each of our
    segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment” of
    this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
    derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
    to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales of the
    Government Communications Systems segment are made directly or
    indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or
    subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses
    providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for
    termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or
    for default based upon performance.



These U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include
    both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of
    allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts fall into three basic types:
    (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for the
    payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of
    performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which
    provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified
    limits, based upon actual results compared with contractual
    targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and
    delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts,
    which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
    discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
    contractor against pre-established performance criteria. Under
    cost-reimbursement contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for
    allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on
    contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially
    or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or
    regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs,
    lobbying costs, charitable contributions and certain litigation
    defense costs.

Our fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts
    or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under firm fixed-price
    contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a
    fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and
    carry the burden of cost overruns. Under fixed-price incentive
    contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings
    accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs as
    well as costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated
    ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), but carry
    the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling
    price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may
    also be adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified
    performance objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and
    fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually receive either
    milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract
    price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government
    in amounts equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the
    contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive
    fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items
    and deliverables under the contract. Fixed-price contracts
    generally have higher profit margins than cost-reimbursement
    contracts. Production contracts are mainly fixed-price
    contracts, and development contracts are generally
    cost-reimbursement contracts.

In fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, approximately
    36 percent, 35 percent and 33 percent,
    respectively, of the total combined revenue of our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments
    was from fixed-price contracts. GWAC and IDIQ contracts, which
    can include task orders for each contract type, require us to
    compete both for the initial contract and then for individual
    task or delivery orders under such contracts.

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for
    default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
    Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
    funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
    policies resulting from various military, political and
    international developments. Long-term government contracts and
    related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for
    subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under
    contracts terminable for the convenience of the
    U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
    payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
    proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
    Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
    the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
    and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
    of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
    In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
    complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
    difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
    developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
    many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
    facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD
    and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of
    risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $6,317 million at July 3, 2009 compared
    with approximately $5,883 million at June 27, 2008 and
    $5,732 million at June 29, 2007. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $1,567 million at
    July 3, 2009 compared with approximately
    $1,658 million at June 27, 2008 and
    $1,467 million at June 29, 2007. The determination of
    backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with
    respect to customer requirements contracts and development and
    production contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products
    and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the
    case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. Unfunded
    backlog is primarily unfilled firm and expected follow-on orders
    that have not yet met our established funding criteria. Our
    established funding criteria require both authorization by the
    customer as well as our management’s determination that
    there is little or no risk



of the authorized funding being rescinded. We do not include
    potential task or delivery orders under IDIQ contracts in our
    backlog. In fiscal 2010, we expect to fill approximately
    71 percent of our total funded backlog as of July 3,
    2009. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or
    that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular
    period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and
    program cancellations, which are beyond our control. Additional
    information with regard to the backlog of each of our segments
    is provided under “Item 1. Business —
    Description of Business by Segment” of this Report.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $1,003 million in fiscal 2009,
    $980 million in fiscal 2008 and $884 million in fiscal
    2007. Company-sponsored research and product development costs,
    which included research and development for commercial products
    and independent research and development related to government
    products and services, as well as concept formulation studies
    and bid and proposal efforts, were approximately
    $244 million in fiscal 2009, $248 million in fiscal
    2008 and $195 million in fiscal 2007. A portion of our
    independent research and development costs are allocated among
    contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government
    contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored research and product
    development costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense
    when incurred. The portion of total research, development and
    engineering expenditures that was not company-sponsored was
    funded by the U.S. Government and is included in our
    revenue. Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $759 million in fiscal 2009, $732 million in fiscal
    2008 and $689 million in fiscal 2007. Company-sponsored
    research is directed to the development of new products and to
    building technological capability in selected communications and
    electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research
    helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. All of
    our segments maintain their own engineering and new product
    development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
    advanced-technology departments. As of July 3, 2009, we
    employed approximately 6,500 engineers and scientists and are
    continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
    our business segments available for all other business segments.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the
    aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large and
    valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how,
    confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other
    intellectual property. We also license intellectual property to
    and from third parties. As of July 3, 2009, we held
    approximately 1,000 U.S. patents and 550 foreign patents,
    and had approximately 575 U.S. patent applications
    pending and 1,450 foreign patent applications pending.
    Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also
    make an important contribution to our business. While our
    intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to
    our business and the operations of our business segments, we do
    not consider our business or any business segment to be
    materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other
    intellectual property right, or any group of related patents,
    licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged
    in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a
    number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which
    generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements
    have generated income in past years and may do so in the future,
    there can be no assurances we will enter into additional
    income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage
    in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual
    property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks,
    copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive
    advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to
    intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report. With regard to patents relating to
    our Government Communications Systems segment, the
    U.S. Government often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
    royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government
    may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by
    such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the
    U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions
    covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks
    used on or in connection with our products are also considered
    to be a valuable asset.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic
    and international laws and regulations designed to protect the
    environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions.
    The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common
    within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve.
    We believe that we have complied with these requirements and
    that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Based upon currently available information, we do not expect
    expenditures to protect the environment and to comply with
    current environmental laws and regulations over the next several
    years to have a material impact on our competitive position or
    financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such
    expenditures will not exceed current expectations. If future
    laws and regulations contain more stringent requirements than



presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than
    our present estimates of those expenditures. We have installed
    waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to
    satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization
    and prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
    environmental capital projects in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 or
    fiscal 2007. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates
    to discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
    environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
    be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
    material in fiscal 2010. These amounts may increase in future
    years. Additional information regarding environmental and
    regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Report and in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Broadcast Communications segment, in particular, is subject
    to domestic and international requirements requiring

end-of-life

management

and/or

restricting materials in products delivered to customers,
    including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and
    Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of certain
    Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted
    similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not
    applicable to most equipment produced by our Government
    Communications Systems and RF Communications segments. We
    believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations,
    where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold
    into such jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations with respect to our future products.

Broadcast and wireless communications (whether TV, radio or
    telecommunications) are also subject to governmental regulation.
    Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications and RF
    Communications segments, in particular, is subject to domestic
    and international requirements to avoid interference among users
    of radio and television frequencies and to permit
    interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
    we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to
    our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules
    and regulations with respect to our future products.
    Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could
    impact our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Raw
    Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
    as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
    numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
    electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
    plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
    dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
    of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
    and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
    restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
    and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
    one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
    of a particular item or because of local content preference
    requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
    While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
    of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
    materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
    materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced
    component shortages from vendors as a result of the RoHS
    environmental regulations in the European Union or similar
    regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations may cause
    a spike in demand for certain electronic components (such as
    lead-free components), resulting in industry-wide supply chain
    shortages. To date, these component shortages have not had a
    material adverse effect on our business. For further discussion
    of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S.
    Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries
    and customer acceptance.

Employees

We employed approximately 15,400 employees at the end of
    fiscal 2009 compared with approximately 14,700 employees at
    the end of fiscal 2008. Approximately 92 percent of our
    employees as of the end of fiscal 2009 were located in the
    United States. A significant number of employees in our
    Government Communications Systems segment possess a security
    clearance. We also utilize a number of independent contractors.
    None of our employees in the United States is represented by a
    labor union. In certain international subsidiaries, our
    employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory
    labor unions. In general, we believe that our relations with our
    employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that
    could impact our business and future results in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this
    Report. In addition, our business, operating results, cash flows
    and financial condition are subject to, and could be materially
    adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties,
    including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of
    which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
    recent results or our anticipated future results.

We
    depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of
    our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding priorities could have adverse
    consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government
    customers. The percentage of our net revenue that was derived
    from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, was approximately 79 percent in
    fiscal 2009, 79 percent in fiscal 2008 and 75 percent
    in fiscal 2007. Therefore, any significant disruption or
    deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government
    would significantly reduce our revenue. Our U.S. Government
    programs must compete with programs managed by other government
    contractors for limited resources and for uncertain levels of
    funding. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to
    expand their business relationships with the
    U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
    future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other
    contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we
    seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through
    competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly
    relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to a
    competitive bidding process, including IDIQ, GWAC, GSA Schedule
    and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater
    competition and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly
    competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive
    or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to
    continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain
    task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the
    competitive bidding process involves substantial costs, the
    significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and
    proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, and the
    risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and
    costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. Following
    any contract award, we may experience significant expense or
    delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result
    of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded
    to us in competitive bidding. We also compete with the
    U.S. Government’s own capabilities and federal
    non-profit contract research centers. Budget decisions made by
    the U.S. Government are



outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our
    business. A shift in U.S. Government spending priorities or
    an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our
    programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending,
    could have material adverse consequences on our future business.

We
    depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts, which
    often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
    implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
    and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
    is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
    contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with
    major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a
    fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made
    available for obligation over the course of three years.
    Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
    initially, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress
    authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding
    for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
    anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which
    could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
    termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
    funds to a program that already has been started could result in
    lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such
    audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any
    costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract
    will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must
    be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs
    we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know
    the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be
    required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon
    completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit
    findings could also result in termination of a contract,
    forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
    suspension or prohibition from doing business with the
    U.S. Government.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain
    provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without
    prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon
    the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time
    of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
    U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
    these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
    would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
    backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
    U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
    our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
    our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
    large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
    regulations and a variety of socio-economic and other
    requirements. These requirements, although customary in
    U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
    compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
    thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
    on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
    regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
    debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
    subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
    debarment are violations of various laws, including those
    related to procurement integrity, export control,
    U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
    protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper
    recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
    U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
    of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
    could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for
    future U.S. Government contracts.

We
    enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses
    in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in
    inflation.

We have a number of firm fixed-price contracts. In fiscal 2009
    and fiscal 2008, approximately 36 percent and
    35 percent, respectively, of the total combined revenue of
    our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
    segments was from fixed-price contracts. These contracts allow
    us to benefit from cost savings, but they carry the risk of
    potential cost overruns because we assume all of the cost
    burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose
    money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can
    expose us to potentially large losses because the
    U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a
    project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of
    its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or
    foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of
    the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new
    technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen
    events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the
    price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost
    overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less
    favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. The United
    States also may experience a significant increase in inflation.
    A significant increase in inflation rates could have a
    significant



adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts.
    Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or
    specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less
    favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated
    damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its
    right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have
    provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we
    fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not
    realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are
    dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our
    contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our
    financial results. Furthermore, the potential impact of this
    risk on our financial results would increase if the mix of our
    contracts and programs shifted toward a greater percentage of
    firm fixed-price contracts.

We
    derive a substantial portion of our revenue from international
    operations and are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
    States. In fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, revenue
    from products exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad
    was 20 percent, 17 percent and 17 percent,
    respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
    25 percent of our international business in fiscal 2009 was
    transacted in local currency environments. Losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We
    expect that international revenue will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant
    portion of our international revenue is in less-developed
    countries. We are subject to risks of doing business
    internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using international dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

We may
    not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to
    conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent
    proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and
    authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before
    we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies
    outside of the United States. For example, the
    U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least

15-60 days,

depending on the size and location of the sale, prior to
    authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to
    foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action
    to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we
    will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary
    licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or
    delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability
    to sell products or technologies outside of the United States
    could negatively impact our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our
    future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized
    by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry
    standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of
    factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target
    markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Develop, manufacture and bring cost-effective offerings to
    market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
    we will need to continue to develop new products and
    technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial
    resources. The need to make these expenditures



could divert our attention and resources from other projects,
    and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will
    lead to the timely development of new products or technologies.
    Due to the design complexity of some of our products and
    technologies, we may experience delays in completing development
    and introducing new products or technologies in the future. Any
    delays could result in increased costs of development or
    redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot
    provide assurances that the markets for our products or
    technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The
    failure of our products or technologies to gain market
    acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our
    business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors
    will not develop competing products or technologies that gain
    market acceptance in advance of our products or technologies, or
    that our competitors will not develop new products or
    technologies that cause our existing products or technologies to
    become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect
    our results of operations. The future direction of the domestic
    and global economies also will have a significant impact on our
    overall performance.

We
    participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and
    expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are
    subject to uncertain economic conditions. As a result, it is
    difficult to estimate the level of growth in some of the markets
    in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting
    and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
    markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of future
    income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may
    make significant investments and expenditures but never realize
    the anticipated benefits.

We
    cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events,
    but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate,
    our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our
    profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in the Middle East and
    the potential for further conflicts and future terrorist
    activities and other recent geo-political events have created
    economic and political uncertainties that could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability.
    These matters cause uncertainty in the world’s financial
    and insurance markets and may increase significantly the
    political, economic and social instability in the geographic
    areas in which we operate. These matters also have caused the
    premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase and may
    cause further increases or some coverages to be unavailable
    altogether.

We
    have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that
    involve significant risks and uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions,
    including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or
    fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other
    acquisition risks;

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    strategic acquisitions do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

Disputes
    with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors
    to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our
    components or parts, could cause our products to be produced in
    an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. We may have
    disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding
    the quality and timeliness of work performed by the
    subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our
    failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders
    under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a
    subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor’s failure
    to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain
    parts or components for many of our products which we source
    from other manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from
    time to time, experience financial and operational difficulties,
    which may impact their ability to supply the materials,
    components and subsystems that we require. Any inability to
    develop alternative sources of supply on a cost-effective and
    timely basis could materially impair our ability to manufacture
    and deliver products to our customers. We can give no assurances
    that we will be free from disputes with our subcontractors,
    material supply problems or component or subsystems problems in
    the future. Also, our



subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to maintain
    the quality of the materials, components and subsystems they
    supply, which might result in greater product returns and
    warranty claims and could harm our business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
    protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
    often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be
    infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon
    those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual
    property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
    royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to
    obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us,
    or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain of our
    products. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary
    technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions
    and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our
    intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully protect
    and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer.
    Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may
    not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or
    scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition,
    our patents may not provide us a significant competitive
    advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to
    monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not
    be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may
    be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design
    around our technology or develop competing technologies.

The
    outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is
    unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are
    involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert
    financial and management resources that would otherwise be used
    to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the
    results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An
    adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to customer credit risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term customer
    financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
    portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
    well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
    obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
    or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been able to
    place a portion of our customer financings with third-party
    lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this risk, a
    portion of these financings is provided directly by us. There
    can be higher risks associated with some of these financings,
    particularly when provided to

start-up

operations such as local network providers, to customers in
    developing countries or to customers in specific
    financing-intensive areas of the telecommunications industry. If
    customers fail to meet their obligations, losses could be
    incurred and such losses could have an adverse effect on us. Our
    losses could be much greater if it becomes more difficult to
    place or insure against these risks with third parties. These
    risks may increase when the availability of credit decreases.

We
    face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
    and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
    relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
    defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
    associated with these systems and products may be untested or
    unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
    products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
    satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems,
    homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
    to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
    circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
    risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
    to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
    substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
    possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
    risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
    incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
    insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for
    which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively
    affect our standing among our customers and the public, thereby
    making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
    could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
    insurance in the future.



Changes
    in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a
    number of factors including:

•

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

The
    effects of the recession in the United States and general
    downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on
    our business, operating results or financial
    condition.

The United States economy is in recession and there has been a
    general downturn in the global economy. Although governments
    worldwide, including the U.S. Government, have initiated
    sweeping economic plans, we are unable to predict the impact,
    severity and duration of these economic events, which could have
    an adverse impact on our business, operating results or
    financial condition in a number of ways. Possible effects of
    these economic events include the following:

•

The U.S. Government could reprioritize its spending away
    from the government contracts in which we participate.

•

We may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash
    flows as a result of reduced orders, payment delays or other
    factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and
    prospective customers.

•

We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other
    problems associated with financial constraints faced by our
    suppliers and subcontractors.

•

We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with
    future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit
    facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing
    our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or
    financing activities.

We
    have significant operations in Florida and other locations that
    could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a
    natural disaster or other significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
    Government Communications Systems segment are located in
    Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Our worldwide
    operations could be subject to natural disasters or other
    significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons,
    tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other
    extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of
    terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications
    failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters
    or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other
    disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to
    our operations or the operations of our suppliers,
    subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers;
    destruction of facilities;

and/or

loss
    of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and
    expenses and materially adversely affect our business, revenue
    and financial condition.

Changes
    in future business conditions could cause business investments
    and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in
    substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results
    of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately 34 percent of our recorded total assets as of
    July 3, 2009. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded
    goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential
    impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on
    several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in
    expected reporting segment cash flows or changes in market
    conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded
    goodwill. For additional information on accounting policies we
    have in place for goodwill impairment, see our discussion under
    “Critical Accounting Policies and



Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” of this Report and

Note 1: Significant
    Accounting Policies

and

Note 22: Impairment of
    Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

in the Notes.

In
    order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm
    us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract significant
    numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding
    security clearances, to support our growth and to replace
    individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or
    for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified
    personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time
    in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or
    training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or
    could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts
    if our needs for such employees were unmet.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
    in Melbourne, Florida. As of July 3, 2009, we operated
    approximately 134 locations in the United States, Canada,
    Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
    6.9 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
    research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
    space, of which approximately 4.4 million square feet were
    owned and approximately 2.5 million square feet were
    leased. There are no material encumbrances on any of our
    facilities. Our leased facilities are, for the most part,
    occupied under leases for remaining terms ranging from one month
    to 10 years, a majority of which can be terminated or
    renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at our option. As
    of July 3, 2009, we had major operations at the following
    locations:

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
    leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
    and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
    While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
    not considered significant. We frequently review our anticipated
    requirements for facilities and will, from time to time, acquire
    additional facilities, expand existing facilities, and dispose
    of existing facilities or parts thereof, as management deems
    necessary. For more information about our lease obligations, see

Note 18: Lease Commitments

in the Notes. Our
    facilities and other properties are generally maintained in good
    operating condition.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal
    incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are,
    and were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and
    litigation commenced by or against us arising from or related to
    matters, including, but not limited to: product liability;
    personal injury; patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other
    intellectual property; labor and employee disputes; commercial
    or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products containing
    asbestos or other restricted materials; breach of warranty; or
    environmental matters. Claimed amounts against us may be
    substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the
    merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court or
    arbitral awards. We record accruals for losses related to those
    matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can
    be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are
    recognized when they are realized and legal costs generally are
    expensed when incurred. While it is not feasible to predict the
    outcome of these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits,
    claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably
    to us, based upon available information, in the opinion of
    management, settlements and final judgments, if any, which are
    considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation
    or arbitration in existence at July 3, 2009 are reserved
    against, covered by insurance or would not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

U.S. Government
    Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such
    as us, are engaged in supplying goods and services to the
    U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore
    dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
    allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
    U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government contracts
    typically involve long lead times for design and development,
    are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
    may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the
    U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
    design and production of complex and technologically advanced
    products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government as either a prime
    contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes
    may arise between the prime contractor and the
    U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
    subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
    contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
    policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
    U.S. Government, and specific agency acquisition
    regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations. As a
    U.S. Government contractor, our contract costs are audited
    and reviewed on a continuing basis by the Defense Contract Audit
    Agency (“DCAA”). The DCAA also reviews the adequacy
    of, and a U.S. Government contractor’s compliance
    with, the contractor’s internal control systems and
    policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property,
    estimating, compensation and management information systems. In
    addition to these routine audits, from time to time, we may,
    either individually or in conjunction with other
    U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits and
    investigations by other agencies of the U.S. Government.
    These audits and investigations are conducted to determine if
    our performance and administration of our U.S. Government
    contracts are compliant with applicable contractual requirements
    and procurement and other applicable Federal laws and
    regulations. These investigations may be conducted without our
    knowledge. We are unable to predict the outcome of such
    investigations or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or
    other actions that could be instituted against us, our officers
    or employees. Under present U.S. Government procurement
    laws and regulations, if indicted or adjudged in violation of
    procurement or other Federal laws, a contractor, such as us, or
    one or more of our operating divisions or subdivisions, could be
    subject to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or
    treble damages. U.S. Government regulations also provide
    that certain findings against a contractor may lead to
    suspension or debarment from eligibility for awards of new
    U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension
    or debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because
    of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition,
    our export privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension
    or revocation of our export privileges also would have a
    material adverse effect on us.

International.

As an international company, we
    are, from time to time, the subject of investigations relating
    to our international operations, including under the
    U.S. export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous
    U.S. Federal, state and international environmental laws
    and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time
    in investigations or litigation of various potential
    environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or
    former facilities or remediation as a result of past activities
    (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From
    time to time, we receive notices from the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or
    international environmental agencies that we are a potentially
    responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”)

and/or

equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for
    cleanup



costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites
    we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by
    us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us
    from past operations. We own, previously owned or are currently
    named as a potentially responsible party at 14 such sites,
    excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement
    or as to which our liability has been finally determined. While
    it is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these
    proceedings, in the opinion of our management, any payments we
    may be required to make as a result of such claims in existence
    at July 3, 2009 will not have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
    Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
    forth in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in
    the Notes, which Note is incorporated herein by reference, and
    in “Item 1. Business — Environmental and
    Other Regulations” of this Report.

HSTX Securities Litigation.

HSTX and certain
    of its current and former officers and directors, including
    certain current Harris officers, were named as defendants in a
    federal securities class action complaint filed on
    September 15, 2008 in the United States District Court for
    the District of Delaware by plaintiff Norfolk County Retirement
    System on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of HSTX
    securities from January 29, 2007 to July 30, 2008,
    including shareholders of Stratex Networks, Inc.
    (“Stratex”) who exchanged shares of Stratex for shares
    of HSTX as part of the combination between Stratex and our
    former Microwave Communications Division to form HSTX.
    Similar complaints were filed in the United States District
    Court for the District of Delaware on October 6, 2008 and
    October 30, 2008. The complaints were consolidated in a
    slightly expanded complaint filed on July 29, 2009 that
    adds Harris Corporation and Ernst & Young LLP as
    defendants. This action relates to public disclosures made by
    HSTX on January 30, 2007 and July 30, 2008, which
    included the restatement of HSTX’s financial statements for
    the first three fiscal quarters of its fiscal 2008 (the quarters
    ended March 28, 2008, December 28, 2007 and
    September 28, 2007) and for its fiscal years ended
    June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005 due
    to accounting errors. The consolidated complaint alleges
    violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the
    Exchange Act and of

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, as well as violations of Section 11
    and Section 15 of the Securities Act, and seeks, among
    other relief, determinations that the action is a proper class
    action, unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable
    attorneys’ fees and costs. We believe that the defendants
    have meritorious defenses to these actions and the defendants
    intend to defend the litigation vigorously.

Dividends

The cash dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in
    our last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
    August 28, 2009, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.20 per
    share to $.22 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $.88 per share and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.22
    per share, which will be paid on September 18, 2009 to
    holders of record on September 9, 2009. Our annualized cash
    dividend rate was $.80 per share, $.60 per share and $.44 per
    share in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.
    Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June,
    September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends
    will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no
    assurances. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant.

    cumulative total return of our common stock with the comparable
    five-year cumulative total returns of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Information Technology Section Index
    (“S&P 500 Information Technology”) and the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index
    (“S&P 500”). The figures assume an initial
    investment of $100 at the close of business on July 2, 2004
    in Harris, the S&P 500 Information Technology and the
    S&P 500, and the reinvestment of all dividends, including,
    with respect to our common stock, the Spin-off dividend. For
    purposes of calculating the cumulative total return of our
    common stock, the then-current market value of the HSTX shares
    distributed in the Spin-off was deemed to have been reinvested
    on the May 27, 2009 Spin-off date in shares of our common
    stock.

Sales of
    Unregistered Securities

During fiscal 2009, we did not issue or sell any unregistered
    securities.

Issuer
    Repurchases of Equity Securities

During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 2,722,438 shares of our
    common stock under our repurchase program at an average price
    per share of $45.88, excluding commissions. During fiscal 2008,
    we repurchased 3,945,136 shares of our common stock under
    our repurchase program at an average price per share of $56.99,
    excluding commissions. The level of our repurchases depends on a
    number of factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject
    to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other
    factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or
    discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled
    and retired.

BUSINESS
    CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
    technology company serving government and commercial markets in
    more than 150 countries. We are dedicated to developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services. Our company generates revenue,
    income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing and selling
    communications products and software as well as providing
    related services. We sell directly to our customers, the largest
    of which are U.S. Government customers and their prime
    contractors, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell
    and market some products and services, especially in
    international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our continuing operations in the following
    three business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of our
    (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National Intelligence
    Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and (iv) IT Services
    businesses; and

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and Workflow and (iii) Transmission Systems
    businesses.



Our segment reporting structure for fiscal 2009 reflects that,
    effective upon the commencement of fiscal 2009, our RF
    Communications business (part of our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment for fiscal 2008) is reported as its own
    separate segment, and our Defense Programs business (the other
    part of our Defense Communications and Electronics segment for
    fiscal 2008) is reported as part of our Government
    Communications Systems segment. Our Broadcast Communications
    segment did not change as a result of those adjustments to our
    segment reporting structure. The historical results, discussion
    and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Report reflect the impact of those adjustments to our segment
    reporting structure for all periods presented in this Report.

Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in
    connection with the May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a
    taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all the shares
    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting
    segment our former HSTX segment. In accordance with Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
    (“Statement 144”), our historical financial results
    have been restated to account for HSTX as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented in this Report, and unless
    otherwise specified, disclosures in this Report relate solely to
    our continuing operations. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

in the Notes for additional information regarding
    discontinued operations.

Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or

“Non-operating

income (loss)” line items in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Value
    Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for Achieving
    Value

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
    Corporation will be the

best-in-class

global provider of mission-critical assured communications
    systems and services to both government and commercial
    customers, combining advanced technology and application
    knowledge.” We are committed to our mission statement, and
    we believe that executing our mission statement creates value.
    Consistent with this commitment to effective execution, we
    currently focus on these key value drivers:

•

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all segments by
    introducing new technology-based products, expanding our
    addressable markets and customer base, and investing in
    international markets and channels;

•

Leveraging technology across business segments;

•

Achieving operating efficiencies and cost reductions by
    delivering on supply chain and operations excellence;

•

Making strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolios and to gain access to new
    markets; and

•

Maintaining an efficient capital structure.

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all
    segments:

We plan to focus on continued
    profitable revenue growth by focusing on the following
    strategies in each segment:

RF Communications:

Continue to leverage our
    reputation and position as a leading provider of secure tactical
    radio communications and embedded high-grade encryption
    solutions for military and government organizations and also of
    secure communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. Expand our market reach with
    new products and in adjacent markets.

Government Communications Systems:

Conduct
    advanced research studies and produce, integrate and support
    highly reliable, net-centric communications and information
    technology that solve the mission-critical challenges of our
    defense, intelligence and civilian U.S. Government
    customers. Leverage core capabilities such as SATCOM; ground
    systems; avionics; data links; mission-critical networks; ISR;
    and space systems. Utilize IT Services business scale to address
    the growing government and commercial services markets. Identify
    and implement growth initiatives in new markets, including
    healthcare solutions, cyberspace and commercial managed services.

Broadcast Communications:

Supply technology
    and service solutions to consumers of rich media, including TV
    stations and networks and cable, satellite, telecommunications
    and other media content providers. Grow our core businesses by
    expanding our product offerings. Expand into new markets,
    including full-motion video for government customers, mobile TV,
    sports stadiums and arenas and digital signage.

Leveraging technology across business
    segments:

One of our strengths is our ability
    to transfer technology among segments and focus our research and
    development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole. An
    example of this is our FAME product, which utilizes COTS
    software and hardware developed by our commercial Broadcast
    Communications segment and applying that technology to
    government applications where there is a need to gather, store,
    distribute and analyze increasingly large amounts of ISR data.
    Another area of focus is cross-selling



through segment sales channels and joint pursuits by multiple
    segments. Other corporate initiatives include joint
    international market channel development, such as shared
    distributors and coordinated

“go-to-market”

strategies.

Achieving operating efficiencies and cost
    reductions:

Our principal focus areas for
    operating efficiencies and cost management are: reducing
    procurement costs through an emphasis on coordinated supply
    chain management; reducing product costs through dedicated
    engineering resources focused on product design; improving
    manufacturing efficiencies across all segments; and optimizing
    facility utilization.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another
    key value driver is effective capital allocation by making
    effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
    the strengths in our base businesses and to gain access to new
    markets. We believe acquisitions may also serve to balance and
    enhance our portfolio of businesses. In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we acquired Wireless Systems, CSI and SolaCom ATC.
    Wireless Systems is an established provider of mission-critical
    wireless communications systems for law enforcement, fire and
    rescue, public service, utility and transportation markets. We
    operate Wireless Systems, which we now call the Public Safety
    and Professional Communications business, within our RF
    Communications segment. We believe the acquisition of Wireless
    Systems creates a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market and greatly accelerates our entry into that
    market. CSI is a Washington, D.C.-area provider of
    mission-enabling engineering solutions that address both
    offensive and defensive IT security challenges for Federal law
    enforcement and other U.S. Government agencies. We operate
    CSI within our Government Communications Systems segment as part
    of the National Intelligence Programs business. We believe the
    acquisition of CSI expands our capabilities, customer footprint
    and current initiatives in the cyber security market. SolaCom
    ATC provides voice and data communications systems and solutions
    for air traffic facilities and radio communications between
    aircraft in flight and air traffic controllers. We operate
    SolaCom ATC within our Government Communications Systems segment
    as part of the Civil Programs business. We believe the
    acquisition of SolaCom ATC provides us with an immediate ability
    to address additional segments of the air traffic control
    voice/data systems market and further positions us to support
    the FAA’s anticipated NextGen program. In fiscal 2007, we
    acquired Multimax Incorporated (“Multimax”), a leading
    provider of information technology and network services for the
    U.S. Government. We operate Multimax within our Government
    Communications Systems segment as part of the IT Services
    business. The acquisition of Multimax provided us greater scale,
    a broader customer base and new growth opportunities through key
    positions on GWACs. In recent years, we have also made several
    acquisitions in our Broadcast Communications segment, including
    Encoda, Leitch, Optimal Solutions, Inc. (“OSi”),
    Aastra Digital Video (“Aastra”) and Zandar
    Technologies plc (“Zandar”). These acquisitions helped
    us expand our product and service portfolios so we can offer

end-to-end

content delivery, transport and asset management solutions to
    our customers.

Maintaining an efficient capital
    structure:

Our capital structure is intended
    to optimize our cost of capital. Our debt is currently rated
    “BBB+” by Standard and Poor’s Rating Group and
    “Baa1” by Moody’s Investors Service. We believe
    our strong capital position, access to key financial markets,
    ability to raise funds at a low effective cost and overall low
    cost of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We had
    $281.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of
    July 3, 2009 and had $666.8 million of cash flows
    provided by operating activities during fiscal 2009. Our cash is
    not restricted and can be used to invest in capital
    expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our common
    stock or pay dividends to our shareholders. As of July 3,
    2009, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase
    approximately $650 million in shares of our common stock
    under our Repurchase Programs. Our Repurchase Programs do not
    have a stated expiration date. The level of our repurchases
    depends on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may
    deem relevant. The timing, volume and nature of share
    repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable
    securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and
    may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Additional
    information regarding share repurchases during fiscal 2009 and
    our Repurchase Programs is set forth above under Part II.
    “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities” of this Report.

Key
    Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
    key indicators of value such as: (1) income from continuing
    operations and income from continuing operations per diluted
    share, (2) revenue, (3) gross margin, (4) income
    from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue,
    (5) net cash provided by operating activities,
    (6) return on average assets and (7) return on average
    equity. The measure of our success is reflected in our results
    of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators:



Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations Key
    Indicators:

Income from continuing
    operations, income from continuing operations per diluted share,
    revenue, gross margin, and income from continuing operations as
    a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value
    drivers:

•

Income from continuing operations decreased 31.1 percent
    from $453.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $312.4 million
    in fiscal 2009 (which included a $196.7 million after-tax
    non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets in our Broadcast Communications segment);

•

Income from continuing operations per diluted share decreased
    29.4 percent from $3.33 in fiscal 2008 to $2.35 in fiscal
    2009 (which included a $1.48 per diluted share after-tax
    non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets in our Broadcast Communications segment);

•

Revenue increased 8.9 percent from $4.6 billion in
    fiscal 2008 to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009;

•

Gross margin (revenue from product sales and services less cost
    of product sales and services) increased slightly from
    31.6 percent of revenue in fiscal 2008 to 31.7 percent
    of revenue in fiscal 2009; and

•

Income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue
    decreased from 9.9 percent in fiscal 2008 to
    6.2 percent in fiscal 2009 (primarily due to the impairment
    charge in fiscal 2009 noted above).

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below
    in this Report for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key
    Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
    activities, return on average assets and return on average
    equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers:

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from
    $555.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $666.8 million in
    fiscal 2009;

•

Return on average assets (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of total assets at
    the beginning and ending of the fiscal year) decreased from
    10.0 percent in fiscal 2008 to 6.9 percent in fiscal
    2009. Return on average assets would have increased in fiscal
    2009 when compared with fiscal 2008 absent the impairment charge
    noted above.

•

Return on average equity (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of
    shareholders’ equity at the beginning and ending of the
    fiscal year) decreased from 21.7 percent in fiscal 2008 to
    15.1 percent in fiscal 2009. Return on average equity would
    have increased in fiscal 2009 when compared with fiscal 2008
    absent the impairment charge noted above.

    and Financial Strategies” below in this Report for more
    information.

Industry-Wide
    Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Defense Markets:

The DoD’s
    U.S. Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2010 budget
    proposal supports military readiness, with a continued focus on
    modernizing the U.S.’s military infrastructure, addressing
    the evolving requirements of

modern-day

warfare, and promoting security within the international
    community. As a result, we expect the U.S. Government to
    remain committed to funding intelligence, information
    superiority, special operations and warfighter support. As a
    result of global economic decline and U.S. budget deficits,
    requirements to upgrade and modernize tactical radio
    communications capabilities and provide more secure,
    interoperable and reliable communications may slow down in the
    near term compared with prior years but we believe they will
    remain a funding priority over the longer term. International
    defense forces continue to drive toward tactical communications
    upgrades and interoperability with the systems and equipment
    used by the U.S. Government.

The DoD’s GFY 2010 budget request is for $664 billion,
    which includes $534 billion for base defense programs and
    $130 billion for overseas contingency operations
    (“OCO”), primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
    DoD’s $130 billion OCO request would fund an increase
    in U.S. troops in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of troops
    from Iraq. It also would fund the training of Afghan and
    Pakistani forces. The GFY 2010 budget proposal would end the
    planned use of supplemental requests to fund OCO
    (previously referred to as the Global War on Terror). OCO
    expenses are now expected to be included as a separate component
    of annual defense budget requests to ensure greater transparency
    and accountability.

The $534 billion GFY 2010 budget request for base programs
    is approximately 4 percent above the GFY 2009 enacted level
    of $513 billion. While this continues a moderate growth
    trend, funding for OCO has been declining and is expected to
    decline further. The GFY 2010 request of $130 billion for
    OCO represents a 12 percent decrease from the GFY 2009
    supplemental funding level of $147 billion (which includes
    an additional $81 billion approved in June 2009), which was
    a 21 percent decrease from the GFY 2008 supplemental level
    of $186 billion.



The DoD Operations and Maintenance account
    (“O&M”), which contains the bulk of funding for
    training, logistics, services and other logistical support, is a
    major account of importance to the defense industry. The budget
    request for GFY 2010, including funding for OCO, is
    $276 billion compared with the GFY 2009 estimate of
    $272 billion.

We also believe that the level of growth and budget amounts
    allocated to DoD procurement accounts (“Procurement”),
    along with research, development, test and evaluation
    (“RDT&E”) components of the DoD budget, are an
    important indicator of DoD spending. These accounts are
    applicable to defense contractors because they generally
    represent the amounts that are expended for military hardware
    and technology. Including OCO funding, GFY 2010 budget requests
    for Procurement and RDT&E of $131 billion and
    $79 billion, respectively, are comparable to GFY 2009
    estimates for Procurement and RDT&E of $133 billion
    and $81 billion, respectively.

Despite the recent slowing in the rate of growth of DoD budgets,
    our products and services appear to be a funding priority in DoD
    spending over the long term, which we believe will positively
    affect our future orders, sales, income and cash flows based on
    the defense markets we serve. Conversely, a decline in the DoD
    budget or a shift in funding priorities may have a negative
    effect on future orders, sales, income and cash flows of defense
    contractors, including us, depending on the weapons platforms
    and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in
    funding priorities.

International governments are expected to continue to increase
    their defense spending on national security and on tactical
    communications modernization and standardization programs, which
    we believe will positively affect our future orders, sales,
    income and cash flows.

Government Markets Other Than
    Defense:

A funding priority for the
    U.S. Government is the security of the U.S., which includes
    better communications interplay among law enforcement, civil
    government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military
    services. Funding for investments in secure tactical
    communications, IT, information processing, healthcare IT, cyber
    security and additional communications assets and upgrades has
    remained solid. Another priority of the U.S. Government is
    investments in productivity, cost reductions and upgrading to
    new IT systems and solutions, including outsourcing. As a
    result, programs that promote these initiatives are also
    expected to receive funding. We provide products and services to
    a number of U.S. Government agencies including the FAA,
    NRO, NGA, Census Bureau, Department of State, NSA, NOAA and
    others. Recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand
    from these agencies to outsource their requirements for better,
    more efficient and less costly information technology and
    communications. We also provide products to Federal, state and
    local government agencies that are committed to protecting our
    homeland and public safety. These agencies are upgrading their
    technologies to improve communications and interoperability.

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to
    U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may
    investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with
    applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of
    those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could
    make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement
    regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a
    government contractor could result in that contractor being
    fined

and/or

suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new
    U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar
    government oversight exists in most other countries where we
    conduct business. We are currently not aware of any compliance
    audits or investigations that could result in a significant
    adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

We are also subject to other risks associated with
    U.S. Government business, including technological
    uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment
    of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are
    discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Commercial Broadcast
    Communications:

The global economic recession
    has adversely impacted spending on capital projects and
    significantly weakened demand, especially in the U.S.

Trends and developments in the broadcast communications market
    include:

•

The transition to HD in North America is maturing rapidly;

•

Internationally, there are significant growth opportunities, as
    the worldwide transition to digital and HD technologies is in
    various stages of implementation;

•

The market is transitioning from the traditional linear
    broadcast TV advertising model to

out-of-home

networks; and

•

There is a greater dependency on suppliers to provide
    systemization and integration support.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
    well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
    the market trends noted above in this Report. While we believe
    that some of these developments may temper near-term growth, we
    also expect they generally will have a longer-term positive
    impact on us.



However, we remain subject to general economic conditions that
    could adversely affect our customers. We also remain subject to
    other risks associated with these markets, including
    technological uncertainties, changes in the Federal
    Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) regulations,
    slow market adoption of digital radio and DTV or any of our new
    products and other risks which are discussed below under
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
    Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our revenue for fiscal 2009 was
    $5,005.0 million, an increase of 8.9 percent compared
    with fiscal 2008. Income from continuing operations for fiscal
    2009 was $312.4 million, a decrease of 31.1 percent
    compared with fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations of
    $453.5 million. Fiscal 2009 revenue increased by
    16.8 percent and 9.3 percent in our RF Communications
    and Government Communications Systems segments, respectively,
    and decreased by 9.3 percent in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Our RF Communications segment revenue
    benefited from continued strength in international markets and
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems, while our Government
    Communications Systems segment revenue benefited from the
    ramping up of the FDCA program for the U.S. Census Bureau
    for the 2010 census and new program wins. The revenue decrease
    in our Broadcast Communications segment reflected lower demand,
    primarily due to the global recession and delays in capital
    spending by customers.

Fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations decreased from
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to a $255.5 million
    ($196.7 million after-tax) non-cash charge for impairment
    of goodwill and other long-lived assets in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Operating income increased in our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments in
    fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase in our
    Government Communications Systems segment operating income was
    primarily due to lower charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs in fiscal 2009
    ($18.0 million) than in fiscal 2008 ($75.9 million),
    the ramp up of the FDCA program and strong results on the FTI
    program.

Additionally, income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009
    was impacted by $28.6 million of charges, net of government
    cost reimbursement, for company-wide cost-reduction actions,
    primarily initiated in response to the global economic slowdown,
    pressure on DoD spending, and contract delays. Those charges
    were comprised of $24.1 million for severance and other
    employee-related exit costs and $4.5 million related to
    consolidation of facilities. An additional charge of
    approximately $3.1 million for cost-reduction actions is
    expected in fiscal 2010. These actions are expected to result in
    annualized cost savings of approximately $70 million to
    $75 million.

We had a fiscal 2009 non-operating loss of $3.1 million
    compared with fiscal 2008 non-operating income of
    $11.4 million. In fiscal 2009, our effective tax rate
    (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing
    operations before income taxes) was 35.6 percent compared
    with an effective tax rate of 32.1 percent in fiscal 2008.

See the “Non-Operating Income (Loss),” “Income
    Taxes” and “Discussion of Business Segments”
    discussions below in this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our revenue for fiscal 2008 was
    $4,596.1 million, an increase of 23.0 percent compared
    with fiscal 2007. Income from continuing operations for fiscal
    2008 was $453.5 million, an increase of 30.6 percent
    compared with fiscal 2007 income from continuing operations of
    $347.2 million. Fiscal 2008 revenue increased as compared
    with fiscal 2007 in all three of our business segments. Fiscal
    2008 revenue increased by 24.1 percent in our Government
    Communications Systems segment, primarily as a result of the
    June 2007 acquisition of Multimax, 27.8 percent in our RF
    Communications segment and 7.3 percent in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. While fiscal 2008 revenue increases
    benefited from our acquisitions of Multimax and Zandar, we also
    had strong organic revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared with
    fiscal 2007.



Fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations increased from
    fiscal 2007, primarily due to our RF Communications segment,
    which continued its strong operating income trends in fiscal
    2008 with a 30.3 percent increase over fiscal 2007
    operating income. Operating income in our Government
    Communications Systems segment increased slightly over fiscal
    2007 operating income, primarily due to the acquisition of
    Multimax, partially offset by $75.9 million of charges
    recorded in fiscal 2008 for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs. Operating income in our
    Broadcast Communications segment improved significantly, from
    $11.9 million in fiscal 2007 to $33.8 million in
    fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 operating income in that segment was
    adversely impacted by $7.5 million of charges associated
    with cost-reduction actions and an $18.9 million write-down
    of capitalized software associated with management’s
    decision to discontinue an automation software development
    effort.

Net interest expense increased to $47.9 million in fiscal
    2008 from $27.1 million in fiscal 2007, mainly due to
    increased borrowings related to the acquisition of Multimax in
    June 2007, as well as lower interest rates earned on our
    invested cash. Fiscal 2008 non-operating income was
    $11.4 million compared with a fiscal 2007 non-operating
    loss of $16.2 million. In fiscal 2008, our effective tax
    rate was 32.1 percent compared with an effective tax rate
    of 33.0 percent in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    essentially flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 at
    31.7 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with 31.6 percent
    in fiscal 2008. The slight increase in gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in gross
    margin as a percentage of revenue in our Government
    Communications Systems segment due to lower charges for schedule
    and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector programs
    incurred in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 and a larger
    mix of sales coming from our higher-margin RF Communications
    segment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. These positive
    impacts to gross margin as a percentage of revenue were almost
    entirely offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of
    revenue in our RF Communications segment in fiscal 2009 compared
    with fiscal 2008 and a lower mix of sales coming from our
    higher-margin Broadcast Communications segment in fiscal 2009
    compared with fiscal 2008. Additionally, gross margin included
    $5.0 million of charges, net of government cost
    reimbursement, for cost-reduction actions. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    31.6 percent in fiscal 2008 compared with 32.6 percent
    in fiscal 2007. Our overall blended fiscal 2008 gross
    margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by a
    larger mix of sales coming from our lower-margin Government
    Communications Systems segment’s products and services in
    fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of
    our acquisition of Multimax in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007. Government Communications Systems gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2008 was slightly lower compared
    with fiscal 2007, reflecting the negative impact from
    $75.9 million of charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs, partially offset by the
    positive impact from the acquisition of Multimax. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased to $791.3 million in
    fiscal 2009 from $746.5 million in fiscal 2008. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to
    15.8 percent in fiscal 2009 from 16.2 percent in
    fiscal 2008. The decrease in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily
    due to revenue growth of 8.9 percent compared with total
    growth in engineering, selling and administrative expenses of
    only 6.0 percent, primarily as a result of cost-reduction
    actions in our Broadcast Communications segment. The increase in
    total engineering, selling and administrative expenses was
    primarily due to $23.6 million of charges for
    cost-reduction actions, $8.3 million of charges related to
    integration costs and a write-off of in-process research and
    development associated with our acquisition of Wireless Systems
    and a $4.1 million charge related to the Spin-off of HSTX.
    Engineering, selling and administrative expenses also increased
    due to higher sales and marketing expenses in our RF
    Communications segment in fiscal 2009 associated with our
    tactical radio systems products and the acquisition of Wireless
    Systems, partially offset by decreases in engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses in our Government Communications
    Systems and Broadcast Communications segments in fiscal 2009.
    See the “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion
    below in this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $243.5 million in fiscal 2009
    compared with $248.0 million in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased to $746.5 million in
    fiscal 2008 from $656.7 million in fiscal 2007. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to
    16.2 percent in fiscal 2008 from 17.6 percent in
    fiscal 2007. Our RF Communications segment engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2008, primarily
    due to research and development costs associated with our
    Falcon III radio. Our Government Communications Systems
    segment engineering, selling and administrative expenses
    increased, primarily due to the acquisition of Multimax in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the impact of recording state
    income taxes allocated to government contracts. Fiscal 2007
    engineering, selling and administrative expenses in our
    Broadcast Communications segment reflected $26.4 million of
    costs incurred related to a write-down of capitalized software
    and cost-reduction actions. See the “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussion below in this MD&A for further
    information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $248.0 million in fiscal 2008
    compared with $195.2 million in fiscal 2007. The increase
    was primarily due to spending on the development of our
    Falcon III radio in our RF Communications segment.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

We had a non-operating loss of
    $3.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared with non-operating
    income of $11.4 million in fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009
    non-operating loss was primarily due to a $7.6 million
    write-down of our investment in AuthenTec, Inc.
    (“AuthenTec”), recorded in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009, to reflect an

other-than-temporary

impairment, partially offset by a $7.5 million gain on the
    sale of certain non-strategic patents in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 non-operating income primarily resulted
    from a $5.6 million gain related to

mark-to-market

adjustments on warrants we held to acquire shares of AuthenTec,
    which were classified as derivatives, and gains of
    $9.8 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in
    AuthenTec. See

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

We had non-operating income of
    $11.4 million in fiscal 2008 compared with a non-operating

    non-operating income primarily resulted from the items noted for
    fiscal 2008 above in the discussion of non-operating income
    (loss) in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2007
    non-operating loss primarily resulted from a $19.8 million
    write-down of our investment in Terion. See

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our effective tax rate (income taxes as
    a percentage of income from continuing operations before income
    taxes) was 35.6 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with
    32.1 percent in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, our effective
    tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory income tax
    rate, primarily due to the non-deductibility of a significant
    portion of the $255.5 million non-cash charge for
    impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets in our
    Broadcast Communications segment recorded in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2009, largely offset by a $3.3 million tax
    benefit relating to fiscal 2008 recorded in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009 when legislative action restored the
    U.S. Federal income tax credit for research and development
    expenses; a $3.7 million state tax benefit in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the filing of our fiscal 2007
    tax returns; and a $6.5 million favorable impact recorded
    in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 from the settlement of the
    U.S. Federal income tax audit of fiscal year 2007. In
    fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate was lower than the
    U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to an
    $11 million favorable impact from the settlement of
    U.S. Federal income tax audits of fiscal years 2004 through
    2006. Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    began recording state income taxes in our Consolidated Statement
    of Income as engineering, selling and administrative expenses to
    the extent such state taxes are reimbursed under government
    contracts, which totaled $9.9 million for fiscal 2008.
    Under U.S. Government regulations, these state income taxes
    are allowable costs in establishing prices for the products and
    services we sell to the U.S. Government. Prior to the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008, these state income taxes were recorded
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income as income taxes. The
    reimbursement of these state income taxes is recorded in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income as revenue for all periods
    presented. As a result of this change, we reduced total income
    tax expense by approximately $6.4 million in fiscal 2008.
    See

Note 23: Income Taxes

in the Notes for further
    information.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Our effective tax rate was
    32.1 percent in fiscal 2008 compared with 33.0 percent
    in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate was lower
    than the U.S. statutory income tax rate because of the
    items noted for fiscal 2008 above in the discussion of income
    taxes in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007,
    our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory
    income tax rate, primarily due to a $12 million favorable
    impact from the settlement concerning the tax audit for fiscal
    years 2001, 2002 and 2003. These favorable impacts to our
    effective tax rate were partially offset by cost-reduction
    initiatives in our Broadcast Communications segment in foreign
    jurisdictions where we had significant net operating losses and
    where we were unable to realize a tax benefit associated with
    these charges due to uncertainty about their realization. See

Note 23: Income Taxes

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 16.8 percent and operating income increased
    8.8 percent from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenue was 32.5 percent in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 34.9 percent in fiscal 2008.
    Revenue growth in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was
    primarily driven by significantly higher international sales and
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems, partially offset by a
    decline in the U.S. market. International tactical radio
    sales increased 66.2 percent from fiscal 2008 levels and
    represented 40 percent of total tactical radio revenue in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 27 percent of total tactical
    radio revenue in fiscal 2008.

The decline in the U.S. market was a result of a
    combination of factors. Pressure on DoD budgets caused by the
    global economic crisis and deficit spending slowed DoD
    procurements for many defense products and systems, including
    tactical radios for modernization programs. For us, the slower
    procurement environment was compounded by reduced urgency for
    radio systems to support operational requirements in Iraq, which
    has been partially offset by additional requirements for
    Afghanistan.

In the international market, demand remained robust and is
    expected to continue to drive significant international revenue
    growth. Communications modernization and standardization
    programs by U.S. allies are expected to continue. We
    provide Falcon tactical radios to more than 100 countries.

We believe, in spite of the near-term decline in the
    U.S. market, longer-term growth prospects for the segment
    remain very positive in both U.S. and international
    markets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we saw a rebound
    in DoD orders. Our RF Communications segment is expected to
    benefit from positive long-term market trends, a very strong
    competitive position and an industry-leading new product
    portfolio. For example, the Falcon III 117G manpack radio
    is the first JTRS-approved tactical radio system that provides
    wideband mobile ad-hoc networked communications. The radio has
    been fielded by all military branches of the DoD and several
    international allies. The radio supports secure, high-bandwidth

on-the-move

communications, delivering an evolving picture of the
    battlefield in real time.

On May 29, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the
    assets of Wireless Systems (formerly known as

M/A-COM),

an
    established provider of mission-critical wireless communications
    systems for law enforcement, fire and rescue, public service,
    utility and transportation markets. In connection with the
    acquisition, we assumed liabilities primarily related to
    Wireless Systems. We did not assume the State of New York
    wireless network contract awarded to Wireless Systems in
    December 2004. We operate Wireless Systems, which we now call
    the Public Safety and Professional Communications business,
    within our RF Communications segment. We believe the acquisition
    creates a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market and greatly accelerates our entry into that
    market. Our fiscal 2009 results of operations reflect five weeks
    of operating results of the newly acquired Public Safety and
    Professional Communications business, representing the period
    subsequent to the acquisition. For further information related
    to the acquisition, including the allocation of the purchase
    price and pro forma results as if the acquisition had taken
    place as of the beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the Notes.

The decline in operating income as a percentage of revenue was
    primarily driven by a decline in gross margin percentage as a
    result of higher sales of lower margin products and
    $8.1 million of charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2009 for cost-reduction actions. Additionally, we incurred
    $9.5 million of transaction-related costs in connection
    with our acquisition of Wireless Systems including the write-off
    of in-process research and development ($7.0 million), the
    impact of a

step-up

in
    inventory ($1.1 million) and integration costs
    ($1.4 million).

Orders for this segment were $1.25 billion for fiscal 2009
    compared with $1.68 billion for fiscal 2008. This segment
    derived 79 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the U.S.
    Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 82 percent in fiscal 2008.



Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 27.8 percent and operating income increased
    30.3 percent in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Revenue
    growth was driven by continuing strong market demand, and also,
    we believe, because of customer preference in both U.S. and
    international markets for Harris Falcon tactical radios.
    Worldwide demand for Harris software-defined tactical radios was
    driven by multiple factors, including modernization programs,
    force expansion, force restructuring, interoperability
    requirements and requirements for network-centric
    communications. Our customers’ priorities continued to
    evolve across the defense, homeland security, public safety and
    peacekeeping landscape. Their communications systems needed to
    be versatile and adaptable in order to be effective in multiple
    operating environments and missions. Demand continued to
    increase for network-centric communications systems that can
    significantly improve situational awareness and force
    effectiveness through communications superiority. Harris Falcon
    radios embrace these changing mission priorities and we believe
    offer superior multimission performance.

The fiscal 2008 operating income increase over fiscal 2007 in
    our RF Communications segment was primarily driven by higher
    sales volume from increased sales of our Falcon III
    handheld radio units. Engineering, selling and administrative
    expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from fiscal 2007 to
    fiscal 2008 in our RF Communications segment as our expenses
    increased at a lower rate than revenue. This segment continued,
    however, to increase its investment in research and development
    associated with our Falcon III product family.

Orders for this segment were $1.68 billion for fiscal 2008
    compared with $1.26 billion for fiscal 2007. This segment
    derived 82 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers in fiscal 2008 compared with 76 percent in fiscal
    2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 9.3 percent and operating income
    increased 34.0 percent from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenue was
    11.2 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with 9.1 percent
    in fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008
    increased in all four of the segment’s businesses (Defense
    Programs, National Intelligence Programs, Civil Programs and IT
    Services), and was primarily driven by a further ramping up of
    the FDCA program for the U.S. Census Bureau for the 2010
    census and classified programs for our national intelligence
    customers. In addition to revenue growth from the FDCA and
    national intelligence customer programs, significant
    contributions to increased revenue in fiscal 2009 came from: the
    CBSP for the U.S. Navy; sales of surveillance equipment;
    the Global Geospatial Intelligence (“GGI”) program for
    the NGA; and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Revenue
    decreases in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 resulted from
    the successful completion of the FAA Voice Switching and Control
    Systems (“VSCS”) refurbishment phase, completion of
    the MTAIP database program for the U.S. Census Bureau and a
    decline in commercial satellite reflectors revenue.

The ramping up of several contract awards in the segment’s
    Healthcare Solutions initiative also contributed to higher
    revenue in fiscal 2009, including a significant
    multi-million-dollar, ten-year contract with Health First, a
    Florida-based healthcare provider.

The increases in operating income and operating income as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008
    were primarily due to significantly lower charges for schedule
    and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector programs in
    fiscal 2009 ($18.0 million) than in fiscal 2008
    ($75.9 million). We have now made final delivery on seven
    of the radial rib-design reflectors. We are under a stop-work
    order on the eighth reflector for reasons unrelated to us. The
    two remaining hoop-design reflectors are also progressing and
    scheduled to be delivered in fiscal 2010. Additionally,
    operating income and operating margin in fiscal 2009 benefitted
    from the ramping up of the FDCA program and strong results on
    the FTI program. These increases to operating income and
    operating income as a percentage of revenue were partially
    offset by charges for cost-reduction actions of
    $5.0 million.

On April 15, 2009, we acquired CSI, a privately held
    110-employee Washington, D.C.-area provider of
    mission-enabling engineering solutions that address both
    offensive and defensive IT security challenges for Federal law
    enforcement and other U.S. Government agencies. We operate CSI
    as part of the National Intelligence Programs



business. The acquisition expands our capabilities, customer
    footprint and current initiatives in the cyber security market.

On June 19, 2009, we acquired 50-employee SolaCom ATC,
    which provides voice and data communications systems and
    solutions for air traffic facilities and radio communications
    between aircraft in flight and air traffic controllers. We
    operate SolaCom ATC as part of the Civil Programs business. We
    believe the acquisition provides our Civil Programs’
    business, a leader in air traffic control communications
    networks and telecommunications infrastructure, with an
    immediate ability to address additional segments of the air
    traffic control voice/data systems market and further positions
    us to support the FAA’s anticipated NextGen program.

Our fiscal 2009 results of operations reflect approximately
    eleven weeks of operating results for CSI and two weeks of
    operating results for SolaCom ATC, representing the periods
    subsequent to those acquisitions, which were not material to the
    financial results of our Government Communications Systems
    segment.

Orders for this segment were $2.7 billion for fiscal 2009
    compared with $2.5 billion for fiscal 2008. This segment
    derived 96 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the U.S.
    Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 96 percent in fiscal 2008.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we were awarded two new
    long-term contracts on major government programs. We were
    awarded a

ten-year

contract, potentially worth $736 million, for the GOES-R GS
    program for NOAA. The GOES-R GS system will receive and process
    satellite data, and generate and distribute weather data to more
    than 10,000 users. We were also awarded a

ten-year

contract, potentially worth $600 million, for the MET
    program. The next-generation large satellite earth stations we
    develop for the MET program will provide the worldwide backbone
    for high-priority military communications and missile defense
    systems.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 24.1 percent and operating income
    increased 0.2 percent from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.
    Organic revenue, excluding the impact of the acquisition of
    Multimax, increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007,
    and was primarily driven by the ramping up of the FDCA program
    for the U.S. Census Bureau and from classified programs for
    our national intelligence customers. Significant contributions
    to increased revenue in fiscal 2008 came from the FDCA program,
    the Patriot technical services program for the NRO, our
    classified programs, the VSCS program for the FAA, the Common
    Data Link-Hawklink program for the U.S. Navy, the WIN-T
    program for the U.S. Army, tactical SATCOM and the NSOM,
    NMCI and NETCENTS programs in our IT Services business.

The increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 was primarily
    due to the acquisition of Multimax and approximately
    $10.0 million of income related to the renegotiation of
    pricing on an IT services contract, partially offset by
    $75.9 million of charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs, encompassing ten
    commercial reflectors in various stages of development,
    assembly, test and delivery. Due to technical difficulties
    experienced on these reflector programs, which necessitated
    design changes and associated cost increases, we also fell
    behind schedule. To mitigate the impact of these schedule
    changes, we began performing these programs in parallel rather
    than in series. This further adversely impacted costs, as costs
    from rework activities associated with further design changes
    were multiplied through all the reflectors in the factory.
    Additionally, engineering, selling and administrative expenses
    in this segment increased in fiscal 2008 when compared with
    fiscal 2007, partly due to a gain recorded on the sale of our
    STAT network security product line in fiscal 2007.

Orders for this segment were $2.5 billion for fiscal 2008
    compared with $2.0 billion for fiscal 2007. This segment
    derived 96 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the U.S.
    Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in
    fiscal 2008 compared with 95 percent in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue decreased 9.3 percent in fiscal 2009 from fiscal
    2008, and this segment had an operating loss of
    $238.0 million in fiscal 2009 compared with operating
    income of $33.8 million in fiscal 2008. The operating loss
    in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a $255.5 million
    non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets, as described in greater detail below. The global
    recession and postponement of capital projects significantly
    weakened demand. Additionally, this segment recorded charges for
    cost-reduction actions of $13.1 million in fiscal 2009, and
    these actions as well as actions taken in the prior-year have
    mitigated the impact of lower revenue on operating performance.

Revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 declined in
    both U.S. and international markets and was lower primarily
    as a result of declining sales in Infrastructure and Networking
    Solutions where the impact of the global market softness was
    most significant. Media and Workflow sales were lower compared
    with the prior fiscal year, with weakness in sales of
    U.S. and international traffic systems partially offset by
    higher sales of media server products. Transmission Systems
    sales were modestly lower compared with the prior fiscal year as
    a result of softness in the global radio market.

Although significantly lower advertising revenue in the
    broadcast industry continued to postpone some capital
    investments, we continued to have success in deploying our
    Harris ONE solution for interoperable workflow. This includes
    the capability of tying together IT-centric file-based
    workflows, broadcast technology for plant infrastructure,
    transmission systems and media enterprise software.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our annual
    impairment tests of our reporting units’ goodwill. Because
    of the global recession and postponement of capital projects
    which significantly weakened demand, and the general decline of
    peer company valuations impacting our valuation, we determined
    that goodwill in our Broadcast Communications segment was
    impaired. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009,
    we recorded a $255.5 million non-cash impairment charge,
    consisting of charges of $160.9 million, $70.2 million
    and $24.4 million for impairment of goodwill, amortizable
    intangible assets and capitalized software, respectively.

Orders for this segment were $529 million for fiscal 2009
    compared with $660 million for fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue increased 7.3 percent in fiscal 2008 from fiscal
    2007, and operating income was $33.8 million in fiscal 2008
    compared with $11.9 million in fiscal 2007. Revenue growth
    in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was across all
    businesses in this segment. The Infrastructure and Networking
    Solutions business, including routers, graphics equipment and
    multiviewers, had double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2008
    compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 sales of traffic and
    billing software solutions also improved, particularly in
    international markets, compared with fiscal 2007. Sales of
    transmission systems grew in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal
    2007 as a result of strong shipments in the U.S. market for
    the

over-the-air

digital transmission build-out.

Increasingly, large media customers selected the Harris ONE
    approach for workflow solutions across the entire broadcast
    delivery chain, tying workflow and signal flow together to
    improve productivity and responsiveness. Examples included
    projects with Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan; Brazilian broadcaster,
    TV Anhanguera; the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture and
    Information for Saudi Television; Kuwait Television; RTV, the
    national public broadcaster in Slovenia; HD suisse, the first HD
    television channel in Switzerland; Sezmi, a new
    U.S. entertainment services company; and SBS, an Australian
    broadcaster.

Fiscal 2008 operating income in this segment was adversely
    impacted by $2.0 million of costs associated with our
    acquisition of Zandar and a decrease in margins due to our
    transition to lead-free products. Fiscal 2007 operating income
    was adversely impacted by $7.5 million of costs associated
    with cost-reduction actions and an $18.9 million write-down
    of capitalized software associated with management’s
    decision to discontinue an automation software development
    effort.

Orders for this segment were $660 million for fiscal 2008
    compared with $666 million for fiscal 2007.

    2008:

Unallocated corporate expense increased
    10.0 percent to $81.4 million in fiscal 2009 from
    $74.0 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to a
    share-based compensation charge



of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009
    related to the Spin-off of HSTX, and a charge of
    $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related
    to cost-reduction actions. As a percentage of revenue,
    unallocated corporate expense was unchanged at 1.6 percent
    in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Corporate eliminations increased
    to $16.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $7.3 million in
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher intersegment activity
    involving the sale of broadcasting equipment through our
    Government Communications Systems segment.

Fiscal 2008 Compared With Fiscal
    2007:

Unallocated corporate expense increased
    12.3 percent to $74.0 million in fiscal 2008 from
    $65.9 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of revenue,
    unallocated corporate expense decreased to 1.6 percent in
    fiscal 2008 from 1.8 percent in fiscal 2007. Corporate
    eliminations decreased to $7.3 million in fiscal 2008 from
    $13.4 million in fiscal 2007, primarily due to less
    intersegment activity on our FTI program.

In-Process
    Research and Development

In connection with our acquisition of Wireless Systems, we
    allocated $7.0 million of the purchase price to two
    in-process research and development projects. These allocations
    represent the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash
    flows related to these incomplete projects. At the acquisition
    date, the development of these projects had not yet reached
    technological feasibility, and the in-process research and
    development had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise
    qualify for capitalization. Accordingly, these costs were
    expensed as a charge to earnings and are included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In making
    these purchase price allocations we relied on present value
    calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments
    and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution
    and project risk. The value assigned to the purchased

in-process

research and development was determined by estimating the costs
    to develop the purchased in-process research and development
    into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash
    flows to their present value using a discount rate of
    15 percent.

The two in-process research and development projects consisted
    of a new product platform and a new technology. As of the
    valuation date, the new product platform project was
    approximately 75 percent complete with a product launch
    expected at the end of calendar 2009 and had remaining costs
    until completion of approximately $2.1 million. As of the
    valuation date, the new technology project was approximately
    80 percent complete with a product launch expected in early
    fiscal 2010 and had remaining costs until completion of
    approximately $1.1 million.

Discontinued
    Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 Spin-off to our shareholders of all the shares
    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting
    segment our former HSTX segment. In accordance with Statement
    144, our historical financial results have been restated to
    account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in this Report. See

Our
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes the results of

    for fiscal 2009, our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and
    the following analysis, includes approximately eleven months of
    cash flows from HSTX. All line items on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet have been restated to account for HSTX as discontinued
    operations. Our cash and cash



equivalents balance was $281.2 million and
    $274.5 million, as of the end of fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008, respectively.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2008 to
    fiscal 2009 was primarily due to $666.8 million provided by
    operating activities and $450.4 million of net proceeds
    from borrowings to partially fund acquisitions, partially offset
    by the $745.3 million of cash paid for acquired businesses,
    $132.3 million of cash used to repurchase shares of our
    common stock, $121.8 million of cash paid for additions of
    property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software,
    $106.6 million used to pay cash dividends, and a
    $100.0 million cash decrease related to the HSTX Spin-off.

Our financial position remained strong at July 3, 2009. We
    ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of
    $281.2 million; we have no long-term debt maturing until
    fiscal 2016; we have a five-year, senior unsecured
    $750 million revolving credit facility that expires in
    September 2013; and we do not have any material defined benefit
    pension plan obligations.

During the current downturn in global financial markets, some
    companies have experienced difficulties with liquidity of their
    cash equivalents, trading investment securities, drawing on
    revolvers, issuing debt and raising capital, which have had an
    adverse impact on their liquidity. Given our current cash
    position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit
    ratings, available credit facilities, cash needs and debt
    structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to
    experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can
    give no assurances.

We also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated
    from operations, our credit facilities and access to the public
    and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to
    provide for our anticipated working capital requirements,
    capital expenditures and repurchases under our share repurchase
    programs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
    We anticipate tax payments over the next three years to be
    approximately equal to our tax expense during the same period.
    We anticipate that our fiscal 2010 cash outlays may include
    strategic acquisitions. Other than those cash outlays noted in
    the “Contractual Obligations” discussion below in this
    MD&A, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and
    repurchases under our share repurchase programs, no other
    significant cash outlays are anticipated in fiscal 2010 and
    thereafter.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
    continue to generate cash flow at current levels, that ongoing
    operational improvements will be achieved, or that the cost or
    availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial
    paper program or our credit facilities or in the debt markets
    will not be impacted by the ongoing credit and capital markets
    disruptions. If we are unable to maintain cash balances or
    generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our
    obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital
    expenditures, reduce or terminate our share repurchase programs,
    reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our
    existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our ability to
    make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our
    indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial
    results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general
    conditions in or affecting the defense, government and broadcast
    communications markets and to general economic, political,
    financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
    beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    operating activities was $666.8 million in fiscal 2009
    compared with $555.5 million in fiscal 2008. Excluding
    HSTX, all of our segments had positive cash flow in fiscal 2009,
    and all of our segments had improved cash flow in fiscal 2009
    when compared with fiscal 2008. The improvement was led by our
    RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
    segments, primarily as a result of those segments’ higher
    operating income.

Net cash used in investing
    activities:

Our net cash used in investing
    activities was $864.6 million in fiscal 2009 compared with
    $134.6 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in investing
    activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to
    $745.3 million of cash paid for acquired businesses,
    $98.7 million of property, plant and equipment additions
    and $23.1 million of capitalized software additions. Net
    cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2008 was primarily
    due to $112.9 million of property, plant and equipment
    additions, $33.3 million of capitalized software additions
    and $19.4 million of cash paid for acquisitions. This was
    partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of securities
    and short-term investments

available-for-sale

of $31.0 million. Our total capital expenditures, including
    capitalized software, in fiscal 2010 are expected to be between
    $150 million and $160 million.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    financing activities was $117.1 million in fiscal 2009
    compared with net cash used in financing activities of
    $418.6 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by
    financing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to
    $450.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings to partially
    fund acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and
    $5.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee
    stock options, partially offset by $132.3 million used to
    repurchase shares of our common stock, $106.6 million used
    to pay cash dividends, and a $100.0 million cash decrease
    related to the HSTX Spin-off.



In fiscal 2009, we issued 498,814 shares of common stock to
    employees under our share-based incentive plans. Net cash used
    in financing activities in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to
    $234.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common
    stock, $138.9 million used for net repayments of borrowings
    and $81.5 million used to pay cash dividends, partially
    offset by $45.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of
    employee stock options. In fiscal 2008, we issued
    1,367,588 shares of common stock to employees under our
    share-based incentive plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2009, we used $125 million to repurchase
    2,722,438 shares of our common stock under our repurchase
    program at an average price per share of $45.91, including
    commissions. During fiscal 2008, we used $225 million to
    repurchase 3,945,136 shares of our common stock under our
    repurchase program at an average price per share of $57.02,
    including commissions. In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008,
    $7.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in shares
    of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to
    satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. Shares
    repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.

On February 27, 2009, our Board of Directors approved the
    new $600 million 2009 Repurchase Program. The 2009
    Repurchase Program is in addition to our previous share
    repurchase authorization under the 2007 Repurchase Program,
    which had a remaining authorization of approximately
    $50 million at February 27, 2009. As of July 3,
    2009, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase
    approximately $650 million in shares of our common stock on
    a combined basis under our Repurchase Programs. Our Repurchase
    Programs do not have a stated expiration date. Repurchases under
    our Repurchase Programs may be made through open market
    purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through
    investment banking institutions or any combination thereof.
    Share repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash.
    The level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors,
    including our financial condition, capital requirements, results
    of operations, future business prospects and other factors that
    our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, volume and
    nature of share repurchases are subject to market conditions,
    applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our
    discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
    Additional information regarding share repurchases during fiscal
    2009 and our Repurchase Programs is set forth above under
    “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities” of this Report.

Dividends

On August 28, 2009, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.20 per
    share to $.22 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $.88 per share, which was our eighth consecutive annual increase
    in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash
    dividend rate was $.80 per share, $.60 per share and $.44 per
    share in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There can be
    no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will
    continue to increase. Quarterly cash dividends are typically
    paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect
    that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future,
    but we can give no assurances. Additional information concerning
    our dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Capital
    Structure and Resources

On September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any time and from time to time during the term of the
    2008 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
    time outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both
    revolving loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. This $750 million credit facility
    replaces our prior $500 million credit facility established
    pursuant to the five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit
    agreement we entered into on March 31, 2005 with a
    syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such



subsidiary borrower must be guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We
    also may designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted
    subsidiaries, which means certain of the covenants and
    representations in the 2008 Credit Agreement do not apply to
    such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on changes in the ratings of our
    senior, unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”) and on the degree of utilization under the 2008
    Credit Agreement (“Utilization”). The base rate is a
    fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate
    plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly
    announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest
    rate margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then
    the interest rate margin over the base rate will increase to
    either 0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on
    Utilization. Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear
    interest at LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over
    LIBOR described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined
    based on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets; certain
    mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and
    leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing investments;
    and certain investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The 2008
    Credit Agreement also requires that we not permit our ratio of
    consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as
    defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and not permit our
    ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
    expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (measured
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the 2008 Credit Agreement in fiscal 2009. The 2008
    Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including:
    failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms,
    covenants and agreements; material inaccuracy of any
    representation or warranty; payment default under other
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million or acceleration of such indebtedness;
    occurrence of one or more final judgments or orders for the
    payment of money in excess of $75 million that remain
    unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability in excess of
    $75 million; any bankruptcy or insolvency; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 3, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had $105.7 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program, which is supported by the 2008 Credit Agreement.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a

semi-annual

basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade



rating event, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase
    the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate
    principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest
    on the notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. In
    conjunction with the issuance of the notes, we entered into
    treasury lock agreements to protect against fluctuations in
    forecasted interest payments resulting from the issuance of
    ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in the benchmark
    U.S. Treasury rate. In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“Statement 133”), these agreements were determined to
    be highly effective in offsetting changes in forecasted interest
    payments as a result of changes in the benchmark
    U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these agreements on
    December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of $5.5 million,
    net of income tax, in shareholders’ equity as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income. This loss, along with
    $5.0 million in debt issuance costs, is being amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the life of the notes, which
    approximates the effective interest rate method, and is
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the
    option of the holders of the debentures. We may redeem the
    remaining $25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures in whole, or in part, at any time at a
    pre-determined redemption price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf registration
    statement, filed with the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to
    the potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $10.0 million from various international banks, the full
    amount of which was available on July 3, 2009. These lines
    provide for borrowings at various interest rates, typically may
    be terminated upon notice, may be used on such terms as mutually
    agreed to by the banks and us, and are reviewed annually for
    renewal or modification. These lines do not require compensating
    balances. We also have a short-term commercial paper program in
    place, which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash
    requirements and which is supported by our 2008 Credit
    Agreement. As of July 3, 2009, we had $105.7 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB+” by Standard and
    Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa1” by Moody’s
    Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating ratios,
    fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient
    for retention of, or improvement to, these debt ratings. There
    are no assurances that our debt ratings will not be reduced in
    the future. If our debt ratings are lowered below
    “investment grade,” then we may not be able to issue
    short-term commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow
    under our credit facilities or pursue other options. In
    addition, if our debt ratings are lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may also be required to provide cash
    collateral to support outstanding performance bonds. For a
    discussion of such performance bonds, see “Commercial
    Commitments” below. We do not currently foresee losing our
    investment-grade debt ratings, but no assurances can be given.
    If our debt ratings were downgraded, however, it could adversely
    impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and
    access to capital markets and our ability to receive certain
    types of contract awards.



Contractual
    Obligations

At July 3, 2009, we had contractual cash obligations to repay
    debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments under
    operating leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations
    are as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
    following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
    not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
    as defined above. As of July 3, 2009, we did not have
    material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
    that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, we
    are not currently a party to any related party transactions that
    materially affect our results of operations, financial condition
    or cash flows.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
    and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
    provide representations, warranties

and/or

indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such
    as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot
    estimate the potential liability from such representations,
    warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown
    conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities
    relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities
    will have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
    acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
    properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
    the event any of these third parties vacates any of these
    premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
    arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
    such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not
    material to our results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Commercial
    Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers or



to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. At
    July 3, 2009, we had commercial commitments on outstanding
    surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements,
    as follows:

The level of our total commercial commitments outstanding at
    July 3, 2009 of $537.4 million is significantly higher
    than the $82.7 million outstanding at June 27, 2008.
    The increase is primarily attributable to our acquisition of
    Wireless Systems. As is customary in bidding for and completing
    network infrastructure projects for public safety systems,
    contractors are required to procure performance/bid bonds,
    standby letters of credit and surety bonds (collectively,
    “Performance Bonds”). Such Performance Bonds normally
    have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the
    industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek
    redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance
    requirements under a contract. A customer is permitted to draw
    on a Performance Bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a
    project contract. In such an event, we would be obligated to
    reimburse the financial institution that issued the Performance
    Bond for the amounts paid. It has been rare for Wireless Systems
    and its predecessors to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. In
    addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure
    Performance Bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered below
    “investment grade,” then we may be required to provide
    collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of
    Performance Bonds. Such a downgrade could increase the cost of
    the issuance of Performance Bonds and could make it more
    difficult to procure Performance Bonds, which would adversely
    impact our ability to compete for contract awards. Such
    collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for
    other operational needs or corporate purposes.

Financial
    Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use
    foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance
    sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments.
    Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging
    programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
    estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
    availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
    change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
    derivatives held at July 3, 2009 would have an impact of
    approximately $0.2 million on the fair value of such
    instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
    associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
    take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
    value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

in the Notes for additional information.

Interest Rates:

As of July 3,
    2009, we have long-term debt obligations and short-term debt
    under our commercial paper program subject to interest rate
    risk. Because the interest rates on our long-term debt
    obligations are fixed, and because our long-term debt is not
    putable (redeemable at the option of the holders of the debt
    prior to maturity), the interest rate risk associated with that
    debt on our results of operations is not material. We have a
    short-term variable-rate commercial paper program in place,
    which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. We
    can give no assurances that interest rates will not change
    significantly or have a material effect on our income or cash
    flows in fiscal 2010.



Impact of
    Foreign Exchange

Approximately 25 percent of our international business was
    transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2009
    compared with 30 percent in fiscal 2008. The impact of
    translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
    U.S. dollars is included as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. At July 3, 2009, the cumulative
    translation adjustment included in shareholders’ equity was
    a $17.5 million loss compared with a $46.5 million
    gain at June 27, 2008. We utilize foreign currency hedging
    instruments to minimize the currency risk of international
    transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate
    fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in
    fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Impact of
    Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
    practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
    inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
    cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing
    prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin,
    revenue or operating income in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
    of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
    accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
    our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
    transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
    estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies
    and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of
    our financial statements because their application places the
    most significant demands on our judgment, with financial
    reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of
    matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in
    subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting
    estimates are described in the following paragraphs. The impact
    and any associated risks related to these estimates on our
    business operations are discussed throughout this MD&A
    where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial
    results. Senior management has discussed the development and
    selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and
    the related disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee
    of our Board of Directors. Preparation of this Report requires
    us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
    estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
    preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
    estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
    based on experience and other information available prior to the
    issuance of the financial statements. Materially different
    results can occur as circumstances change and additional
    information becomes known, including for estimates that we do
    not deem “critical.”

Revenue
    Recognition on Development and Production Contracts and Contract
    Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
    development and production contracts, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified
    Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
    accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
    Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”).

Cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. Government also
    are specifically accounted for in accordance with Accounting
    Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 11,
    Section A, “Government Contracts, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee
    Contracts” (“ARB 43”).

Revenue related to development and production contracts is
    recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
    to date against estimated total contract costs at completion

(“cost-to-cost”)

with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
    profit. The

percentage-of-completion

method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
    Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
    segments. Revenue is recorded on certain development and
    production contracts within our RF Communications segment using
    the units-of-delivery method rather than the cost-to-cost
    method. Under the units-of-delivery method, sales and profits
    are recorded based on the ratio of actual units delivered to
    estimated total units to be delivered under the contract.
    Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
    items that may change the scope of a contract are included in
    revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and realization
    is probable. Incentives or penalties and award fees applicable
    to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales
    and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient
    information to assess anticipated contract performance.
    Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based solely on a
    single significant



event, generally are not recognized until the event occurs.
    Contracts generally are not segmented. If contracts are
    segmented, we have determined that they meet the segmenting
    criteria stated in

SOP 81-1.

Under the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
    used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire
    period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and
    production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the
    contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at
    completion and the measurement of progress toward completion.
    The estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the
    difference between the estimated contract value and the
    estimated total cost at completion. Due to the

long-term

nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total
    cost at completion often requires significant judgment. Factors
    that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed
    include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature
    and complexity of the work to be performed, availability and
    cost of materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of
    delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the
    customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
    contract included in any estimate to complete. We review cost
    performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts
    at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a
    change in estimated cost to complete a contract is determined to
    have an impact on contract earnings, we will record a positive
    or negative adjustment to estimated earnings when identified.
    Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable contract are
    recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal
    to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. These
    profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of allowable
    costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement. Thus,
    cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to the
    same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We have
    not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to
    estimate our costs related to development and production
    contracts in the past three fiscal years.

As of July 3, 2009, the amount of unbilled costs and
    accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts classified as
    Inventory in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was
    $305.0 million compared with $215.5 million as of
    June 27, 2008. These amounts include gross costs and
    accrued income, which is netted against billings and progress
    payments. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    programs could have a material effect on our statement of
    financial position and results of operations. For example, a one
    percent variance in our estimate of accrued income booked as of
    July 3, 2009 on all open fixed-price contracts would impact
    our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
    services by $12.1 million.

Provisions
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
    balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
    competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
    obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
    requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
    and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
    primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand,
    anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
    review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our
    business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and
    use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product
    line, technological change and new product development. These
    factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
    inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
    future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
    we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
    excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
    that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
    recognize such costs in the “Cost of product sales”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of
    such determination. In the case of goods which have been written
    down below cost at the close of a fiscal year, such reduced
    amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting
    purposes. We have not made any material changes in the reserve
    methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during
    the past three fiscal years.

As of July 3, 2009, our reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory was $68.3 million, or 10.1 percent of our
    gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of
    $44.2 million, or 8.5 percent of our gross inventory
    balance, as of June 27, 2008. We recorded
    $8.6 million, $12.4 million and $19.3 million in
    inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess
    and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations
    before income taxes during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure
    the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand,
    including the impact of planned future product launches, any
    significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and our reported operating results.

Goodwill

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“Statement 142”), goodwill is not amortized. Under
    the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to



perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent)
    impairment tests of our goodwill. We test goodwill for
    impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to
    identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of
    each of our reporting units, which we define as our business
    segments, with its net book value, including goodwill, adjusted
    for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as
    appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
    adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
    goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
    combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
    to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any
    unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had
    been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of
    the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit.

We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on
    projected cash flows, and sales and earnings multiples applied
    to the latest twelve months’ sales and earnings of our
    reporting units. Projected cash flows are based on our best
    estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet
    metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market
    conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash
    flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate which
    reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. The sales and
    earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our
    reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and
    earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings
    multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses
    made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any implied
    control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based
    purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value
    determined by using all of the above-described models, is
    reasonable. We have not made any material changes during the
    past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the
    assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our annual
    impairment tests of our reporting units’ goodwill. Because
    of the global recession and postponement of capital projects
    which significantly weakened demand, and the general decline of
    peer company valuations impacting our valuation, we determined
    that goodwill in our Broadcast Communications segment was
    impaired. As a result, we recorded a $160.9 million
    non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill. See

Note 8: Goodwill

and

Note 22: Impairment of
    Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for additional
    information regarding goodwill, including impairment of our
    Broadcast Communications segment’s goodwill.

Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 3,
    2009 and June 27, 2008 was $1,507.1 million and
    $1,262.5 million, respectively. Although we make reasonable
    efforts to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the fair value
    of our reporting units, future changes in the assumptions used
    to make these estimates or a further decline in industry
    conditions could result in the recording of additional
    impairment losses in our Broadcast Communications segment.

Income
    Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
    specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
    regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
    balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
    required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
    depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
    appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
    gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
    under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
    for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
    future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
    existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We
    have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three
    fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 3, 2009 includes
    a current deferred tax asset of $117.2 million and a
    non-current deferred tax asset of $85.3 million. This
    compares with a current deferred tax asset of
    $103.9 million and a non-current deferred tax liability of
    $42.5 million as of June 27, 2008. For all
    jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we
    expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are
    sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income
    needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance
    related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $72.5 million as of
    July 3, 2009 and $84.4 million as of June 27,
    2008. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy
    of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss
    in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient
    future taxable income, or if



there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or
    time period within which the underlying temporary differences
    become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax
    planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase
    the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of
    our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in
    our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our
    operating results.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but
    have not yet been implemented by us are described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

in the Notes, which describes the potential
    impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from our historical results
    or our current expectations or projections. Other factors
    besides those listed here also could adversely affect us. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report for more
    information regarding factors that might cause our results to
    differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the
    forward-looking statements contained in this Report.

•

We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant
    portion of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a
    shift in U.S. Government funding priorities could have
    adverse consequences on our future business.

•

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts,
    which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase
    in inflation.

•

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business internationally, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates.

•

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export
    licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may
    prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

•

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our
    subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely
    deliver our components or parts, could cause our products to be
    produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

•

We are subject to customer credit risk.

•

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

•

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

•

The effects of the recession in the United States and general
    downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on
    our business, operating results or financial condition.

•

We have significant operations in Florida and other locations
    that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of
    a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

•

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments

and/or

recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in substantial
    losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of
    operations.

•

In order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies
    and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk
    Management” in “Item 7. Management’s

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation (the “Company”)
    is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
    internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
    appropriate cost-benefit analysis, regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of July 3, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s
    assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the
    Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 3, 2009.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
    internal controls of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems
    business (“Wireless Systems”), which was acquired by
    the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Wireless
    Systems is included in the 2009 consolidated financial
    statements of the Company. Wireless Systems constituted
    $883.1 million and $597.5 million of total assets and
    net assets, respectively, as of July 3, 2009. Wireless
    Systems’ revenue was $47.3 million for the year ended
    July 3, 2009. Wireless Systems’ total assets and net
    assets as of July 3, 2009 were 19.8 percent and
    32.0 percent of the Company’s total assets and net
    assets, respectively. Wireless Systems’ revenue for the
    year ended July 3, 2009 was 0.9 percent of the
    Company’s total revenue. Management will include the
    internal controls of Wireless Systems in its assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting for fiscal 2010.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears on page 58 of this
    Annual Report on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Harris Corporation as of July 3, 2009 and June 27,
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash
    flows, and comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity,
    for each of the three years in the period ended July 3,
    2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(2). These financial
    statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Harris Corporation at July 3, 2009
    and June 27, 2008, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended July 3, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 3, 2009, based on criteria established
    in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated August 31, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited Harris Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 3, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Harris
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems business
    (“Wireless Systems”), which is included in the 2009
    consolidated financial statements of Harris Corporation.
    Wireless Systems constituted $883.1 million and
    $597.5 million of total assets and net assets,
    respectively, as of July 3, 2009 and $47.3 million of
    revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control
    over financial reporting of Harris Corporation also did not
    include an evaluation of the internal controls over Wireless
    Systems.

In our opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 3, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation as of
    July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and comprehensive
    income and shareholders’ equity, for each of the three
    years in the period ended July 3, 2009 of Harris
    Corporation and our report dated August 31, 2009 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— Our Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
    and its consolidated subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (these “Notes”), the
    terms “Harris,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Harris Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 spin-off (the “Spin-off”) in the
    form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all
    the shares of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (“HSTX”)
    common stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting segment
    our former HSTX segment, which is reported as discontinued
    operations in this Report. Until the Spin-off, HSTX (formerly
    our Microwave Communications segment), a provider of wireless
    network solutions, was our majority-owned subsidiary, and
    HSTX’s results of operations and financial position were
    consolidated into our financial statements. Subsequent to the
    Spin-off, we no longer own an equity interest in HSTX and,
    therefore, HSTX no longer constitutes part of our business
    operations. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“Statement 144”),
    our historical financial results have been restated to account
    for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods presented in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(this “Report”). See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in the Notes relate
    solely to our continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

— Our Consolidated Financial
    Statements have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These
    estimates are based on experience and other information
    available prior to issuance of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Materially different results can occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
    Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2009 includes 53 weeks.
    Each of fiscal 2008 and 2007 includes 52 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
    months when purchased. These investments include accrued
    interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Equity Securities

— Marketable
    equity securities

available-for-sale

are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“Statement
    115”), and are classified accordingly at the time of
    purchase. We consider all our

available-for-sale

securities as available for use in our current operations. All
    of our marketable equity securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses,
    net of taxes, included as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
    marketable equity securities

available-for-sale

are determined using the specific identification method. In
    instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
    the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
    of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
    an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an

“other-than-temporary”

impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the
    value of the investment security recorded on the financial
    statements and our current estimate of fair value is recognized
    as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is
    determined.

The cost basis of marketable equity securities

available-for-sale,

consisting primarily of shares of common stock of AuthenTec,
    Inc. (“AuthenTec”), was $3.7 million and
    $11.5 million at July 3, 2009 and June 27, 2008,
    respectively.

Selected Investments

— Selected investments are
    investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
    fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
    cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
    cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
    requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
    estimate the value of the securities without an independent
    appraisal based upon available information such as projected
    cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
    recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
    and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
    underlying company. In fiscal 2007, the “Non-operating
    income (loss)” line item in our Consolidated Statement



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of Income included a write-down of $19.8 million related to
    our investment in Terion, Inc. (“Terion”) due to an

other-than-temporary

impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and a
    $1.8 million gain in the third quarter of fiscal 2007
    resulting from proceeds received from Terion following
    Terion’s sale of substantially all of its assets on
    January 10, 2007. As a result of our receipt of proceeds
    from Terion following the sale in fiscal 2007 as described
    above, we did not have any selected investments at July 3,
    2009 or June 27, 2008.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    cash and cash equivalents, marketable equity securities

available-for-sale,

accounts receivable, non-current receivables, notes receivable,
    accounts payable and short-term and long-term debt approximate
    their fair values. Fair values for long-term debt are based
    primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
    instruments. A discussion of fair values for our derivative
    financial instruments is included under the caption
    “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
    net realizable value and they do not bear interest. This value
    includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to
    reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances
    which is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We
    calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs,
    level of past due accounts and economic status of the customers.
    We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the
    term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded
    at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. See

Note 5: Receivables

for additional information
    regarding accounts receivable.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory
    quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and
    obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
    product demand and production requirements. See

Note 6:
    Inventories

for additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of
    buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
    straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
    lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 45 years.
    The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
    range between 2 and 10 years. Software capitalized for
    internal use is accounted for in accordance with the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”)
    Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”).

Amortization of internal-use software begins when the software
    is put into service and is based on the expected useful life of
    the software. The useful lives over which we amortize
    internal-use software generally range between 2 and
    7 years. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

for additional information regarding property, plant and
    equipment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— In accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“Statement 142”), goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Under
    the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to perform
    annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent)
    impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment by comparing their fair value (determined by
    forecasting future cash flows) against their carrying value. We
    test goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. The first
    step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair
    value of each of our reporting units, which we define as our
    business segments, with its net book value, including goodwill,
    adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as
    appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
    adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
    goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
    combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
    to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any
    unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had
    been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of
    the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill, Note 9:
    Intangible Assets

and

Note 22: Impairment of
    Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for additional
    information regarding goodwill and intangible assets, including
    goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in
    fiscal 2009.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Long-Lived Assets, Including Finite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Long-lived assets, including finite-lived
    intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives. We assess the recoverability of the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with
    finite useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be
    recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based
    upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such
    assets. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash
    flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
    would be recognized for the difference between the fair value
    and the carrying amount. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and
    Equipment, Note 9: Intangible Assets

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

for additional information regarding long-lived
    assets and intangible assets, including impairment charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

Capitalized Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed

— Capitalized software to be sold, leased
    or otherwise marketed is accounted for in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,
    “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
    Leased, or Otherwise Marketed” (“Statement 86”).
    Costs incurred to acquire or create a computer software product
    are expensed when incurred as research and development until
    technological feasibility has been established for the product,
    at which point such costs are capitalized. Technological
    feasibility is normally established upon completion of a
    detailed program design. Capitalization of computer software
    costs ceases when the product is available for general release
    to customers. Costs of reproduction, documentation, training
    materials, physical packaging, maintenance and customer support
    are charged to cost of products sold as incurred. Capitalized
    software is evaluated for impairment periodically by comparing
    the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product
    to the net realizable value of that product. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $24.4 million
    write-down of capitalized software in our Broadcast
    Communications segment based on current market conditions that
    have resulted in reduced levels of capital expenditures,
    including demand for Broadcast Communications’ software
    products. See

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other
    Long-Lived Assets

for additional information regarding
    impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2009. In the third quarter
    of fiscal 2007, we recorded an $18.9 million write-down of
    capitalized software in our Broadcast Communications segment.
    The write-down was a result of management’s decision to
    discontinue an automation software development effort. These
    write-downs are included in the “Engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

Capitalized software accounted for under Statement 86 had a net
    carrying value of $22.4 million at July 3, 2009 and
    $42.3 million at June 27, 2008. Total amortization
    expense related to these capitalized software amounts for fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007 was $4.7 million, $3.8 million and
    $1.8 million, respectively. The annual amortization of
    capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed
    using (a) the ratio that current gross revenues for a
    product bear to the total of current and anticipated future
    gross revenues for that product or (b) the straight-line
    method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
    product. Based on this policy, the useful lives over which we
    amortize costs of computer software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed range from three years to seven years.
    Amortization commences when the product is available for general
    release to customers. The capitalized costs, net of accumulated
    amortization, are reflected in the “Other non-current
    assets” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
    amortization of capitalized software is included in the
    “Cost of product sales” line item in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No current
    assets other than those already set forth in the line items in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our
    total current assets as of July 3, 2009 or June 27,
    2008. No assets within the “Other non-current assets”
    line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded
    5 percent of total assets as of July 3, 2009 or
    June 27, 2008. No accrued liabilities or expenses within
    the “Other accrued items” or “Other long-term
    liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    exceeded 5 percent of our total current liabilities or
    total liabilities, respectively, as of July 3, 2009 or
    June 27, 2008. Also, see the caption
    “Reclassifications” in this

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

for additional information
    regarding other assets and liabilities.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
    tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
    deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
    timing of the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning
    strategies. See

Note 23: Income Taxes

for additional
    information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production
    contract sales in our Government Communications Systems and RF
    Communications segments, the value or price of our warranty is
    generally included in the contract and funded by the customer. A
    provision for warranties is built into the estimated program
    costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when applying
    the

cost-to-cost

percentage-of-completion

revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are
    charged to the specific program’s cost, and both revenue
    and cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the
    estimated program cost for warranties include terms of the
    contract, complexity of the delivered product or service, number
    of installed units, historical experience and management’s
    judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost
    per claim.

On product sales in our RF Communications, Broadcast
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments,
    we provide for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The
    specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending
    upon the product sold, customer and country in which we do
    business. In the case of products sold by us, our warranties
    start from the shipment, delivery or customer acceptance date
    and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to twelve years

Broadcast Communications

One to five years

Government Communications Systems

One year

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
    customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
    those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
    warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, historical experience and
    management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
    warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
    our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
    adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
    Communications segment generally carry a

90-day

warranty from the date of shipment. Our liability under these
    warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of any portion
    of the software found not to be in substantial compliance with
    the specifications or, if we are unable to do so, to provide a
    full refund.

Software license agreements and sales contracts for products in
    our Broadcast Communications segment generally include
    provisions for indemnifying customers against certain specified
    liabilities should that segment’s products infringe certain
    intellectual property rights of third parties. Certain of our
    Broadcast Communications transmission systems customers have
    notified us of potential claims against us based on these
    standard indemnification provisions included in sales contracts
    between us and these customers. These indemnification claims
    arise from litigation brought by a third-party patent licensing
    company asserting alleged technology rights against these
    customers. We are cooperating with these customers in efforts to
    mitigate their litigation exposure. To date, we have not
    incurred material costs as a result of such indemnification and
    have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in
    our Consolidated Financial Statements. See

Note 10:
    Accrued Warranties

for additional information regarding
    warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
    currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
    currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
    of exchange and income and expense items are translated at the
    weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based
    Compensation

— In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“Statement 123R”), we
    measure compensation cost for all share-based payments
    (including employee stock options) at fair value and recognize
    cost over the vesting period. It is our policy to issue shares
    when options are exercised. We have also repurchased shares of
    our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued
    under our stock incentive plans. See

Note 14: Stock
    Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

for additional
    information regarding share-based compensation.

Restructuring Costs

— In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
    “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities” (“Statement 146”), we record
    restructuring charges for sales or terminations of product
    lines, closures or relocations of business activities, changes
    in management structure, and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fundamental reorganizations that affect the nature and focus of
    operations. Such costs include one-time termination benefits,
    contract termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities
    or relocate employees. We record these charges at their fair
    value when incurred. In cases where employees are required to
    render service until they are terminated in order to receive the
    termination benefits and will be retained beyond the minimum
    retention period, we record the expense ratably over the future
    service period. These charges are included as a component of the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, due to the global
    economic slowdown, pressure on Department of Defense
    (“DoD”) spending, and contract delays, we announced a
    number of cost-reduction actions across our business segments
    and at our corporate headquarters. In accordance with Statement
    146, we recorded charges, net of government cost reimbursement,
    of $17.8 million for severance and other employee-related
    exit costs and $4.5 million related to consolidation of
    facilities. As of the end of fiscal 2009, we have recorded
    liabilities associated with these restructuring activities of
    $26.5 million, of which the majority will be paid within
    the next twelve months.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
    following revenue recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
    segment:

Revenue in our Government Communications
    Systems segment primarily relates to development and production
    contracts. Revenue and anticipated profits under development and
    production contracts are recorded on a

percentage-of-completion

basis, generally using the

cost-to-cost

method of accounting where sales and profits are recorded based
    on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at
    completion. Recognition of profit on development and production
    fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the total contract
    value; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
    progress towards completion. Revenue and profits on
    cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized as allowable costs
    are incurred on the contract, and become billable to the
    customer, in an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the
    profit on those costs.

Contracts are combined when specific aggregation criteria stated
    in AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”)

are met. Criteria generally include closely interrelated
    activities performed for a single customer within the same
    economic environment. Contracts generally are not segmented. If
    contracts are segmented, we have determined that they meet the
    segmenting criteria stated in

SOP 81-1.

Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
    items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
    estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
    and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered
    in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there
    is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
    performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
    solely on a single significant event, are generally not
    recognized until the event occurs. When adjustments in contract
    value or estimated costs are determined, any changes from prior
    estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period.
    Anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are
    charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product sales other than
    development and production contracts and revenue from service
    arrangements, which are recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collection is probable, delivery of a product has occurred, and
    title has transferred or services have been rendered. Further,
    if an arrangement other than a development and production
    contract requires the delivery or performance of multiple
    deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we determine
    whether the individual elements represent “separate units
    of accounting” under the requirements of Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

00-21,

“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”

(“EITF 00-21”).

If the separate elements meet the requirements listed in

EITF 00-21,

we recognize the revenue associated with each element separately
    and contract revenue is allocated among elements based on
    relative fair value. If the elements within a bundled sale are
    not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an
    individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
    are undelivered elements that are essential to the
    functionality. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized
    by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts.
    Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance
    exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless
    these obligations are satisfied.

RF Communications segment:

Revenue in our RF
    Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
    sales. Revenue recognition from development and production
    contracts and product and services sales follows the same
    policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
    segment’s revenue recognition policy above except that our
    RF Communications segment also uses the

units-of-delivery

method of accounting as well as the

cost-to-cost

method of accounting for production contracts that call for the
    delivery of larger quantities



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of products. Under the

units-of-delivery

method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
    actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
    under the contract.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in
    our Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to
    product and services sales and software licenses. Revenue
    recognition from development and production contracts and
    product and services sales follows the same policies as stated
    under our Government Communications Systems segment’s
    revenue recognition policy above. This segment derives a portion
    of its revenue from the licensing of software with multi-year
    maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue allocated to
    undelivered elements under these bundled software licenses is
    based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual
    method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as
    indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as
    unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements
    is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned
    revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a
    straight-line basis over the maintenance agreement. In the case
    of software products for which we sell term-based licenses
    including multi-year maintenance agreements, but do not have
    vendor-specific objective evidence on the undelivered element,
    the entire arrangement is recognized ratably on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the license.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a
    component of the “Non-operating income (loss)” line
    item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized
    on the basis of terms specified in contractual agreements.
    Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in
    the “Revenue from product sales” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income and the associated costs are
    included in the “Cost of product sales” line item in
    our Consolidated Statement of Income. Also, we record taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from
    revenues.

Retirement Benefits

— As of July 3, 2009,
    we provide retirement benefits to substantially all

U.S.-based

employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
    plan having matching and savings elements. Contributions by us
    to the retirement plan are based on employees’ savings with
    no other funding requirements. Fiscal 2007 retirement plans
    included a profit sharing component of $38.4 million. We
    may make additional contributions to the retirement plan at our
    discretion. Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited
    healthcare plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and employees on long-term disability. We accrue the
    estimated cost of these medical benefits, which are not
    material, during an employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expenses amounted to $31.9 million in
    fiscal 2009, $33.2 million in fiscal 2008 and
    $81.1 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 profit
    sharing under our performance reward plan is recorded as
    compensation expense.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
    environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
    of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
    contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
    existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
    costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 14 sites
    where future liabilities could exist. These sites include 2
    sites owned by us, 8 sites associated with our former graphics
    or semiconductor locations and 4 treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
    attributable to us from past operations. Additionally, future
    liabilities could exist at 7 sites acquired by us as part of our
    acquisition of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems business.
    Based on an assessment of relevant factors, we have estimated
    that our discounted liability under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly
    known as the “Superfund Act”) and other environmental
    statutes and regulations for identified sites, using a
    6.5 percent discount rate, is approximately
    $6.3 million. The current portion of this liability is
    included in the “Other accrued items” line item and
    the non-current portion is included in the “Other long-term
    liabilities” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred
    over the next 15 to 20 years (depending on the number of
    years for each site) is approximately $9.1 million. The
    expected payments for the next five years are: fiscal
    2010 — $1.0 million; fiscal 2011 —
    $1.3 million; fiscal 2012 — $0.8 million;
    fiscal 2013 — $0.7 million;
    fiscal 2014 — $0.8 million; and the
    aggregate amount thereafter is approximately $4.5 million.
    The relevant factors we considered in estimating our potential
    liabilities under the Superfund Act and other environmental
    statutes and regulations include cost-sharing agreements with
    other parties and the potential indemnification from successor
    and predecessor owners of these sites. We do not believe that
    uncertainties with respect to these relevant factors would
    materially affect our potential liability under the Superfund
    Act and other environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
    Commitments

— Guarantees are contingent
    commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
    a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
    paper



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. At
    July 3, 2009, there are no such contingent commitments, nor
    are any guarantees accrued for in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. At July 3, 2009, we had total
    commercial commitments, including debt and performance
    guarantees, of $537.4 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

— In
    the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“Statement 133”) requires us to recognize all
    derivatives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.
    Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
    through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
    nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative
    are either offset against the change in fair value of assets,
    liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized
    in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
    in earnings. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading
    purposes. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

for additional information regarding our
    use of derivative instruments.

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is
    based upon the weighted average number of common and common
    equivalent shares outstanding during each year. See

Note 15: Income From Continuing Operations
    Per Diluted Share

for additional information regarding
    net income per share.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    to conform with current-year classifications. These
    reclassifications include:

•

Reclassifying $5.8 million and $63.1 million of
    investments associated with our non-qualified deferred
    compensation plans from the “Compensation and
    benefits” line item to the “Other current assets”
    and “Other non-current assets” line items,
    respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet;

•

Reclassifying $58.6 million of obligations to pay benefits
    under our non-qualified deferred compensation plans from the
    “Compensation and benefits” line item to the
    “Other long-term liabilities” line item in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet; and

•

Reclassifying $14.1 million of advance payments on extended
    warranty contracts from the “Advanced payments and unearned
    income” line item to the “Other long-term
    liabilities” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which sets out a consistent framework
    for preparers to use to determine the appropriate level of tax
    reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This
    interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“Statement 109”) uses a two-step approach wherein a
    tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not
    to be sustained. The amount of the benefit to be recognized is
    the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being ultimately sustained. FIN 48 also sets
    out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an
    entity’s tax reserves. We implemented FIN 48 effective
    June 30, 2007, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2008.
    See

Note 23: Income Taxes

for information regarding
    the impact on our financial position of implementing FIN 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“Statement 158”), which amends FASB
    Statements No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions;” No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
    Plans and for Termination Benefits;” No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions;” and No. 132(R),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pension and Other
    Postretirement Benefits.” In the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007, we adopted the portion of Statement 158 that requires the
    recognition and disclosure of the overfunded or underfunded
    status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or
    liability as described in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for our fiscal year ended June 29, 2007.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Statement 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded
    status of a plan as of the date of the employer’s year-end
    balance sheet, with limited exceptions. This portion of
    Statement 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008, which for us was fiscal 2009 (which
    ended July 3, 2009). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009,
    we adopted the portion of Statement 158 that requires an
    employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date
    of the employer’s year-end balance sheet. Certain of our
    plans had measurement dates that did not coincide with our
    fiscal year end and thus we were required to change their
    measurement dates in fiscal 2009. The change in measurement
    dates did not materially impact our financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“Statement 157”). Statement 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157
    applies under other accounting pronouncements that require fair
    value measurement in which the FASB concluded that fair value
    was the relevant measurement, but does not require any new fair
    value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”)

No. FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
    (“FSP

FAS 157-2”),

which defers the effective date of Statement 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, which
    for us is our fiscal 2010. We adopted Statement 157 in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and there was no impact to our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. In accordance
    with FSP

FAS 157-2,

we elected to defer until fiscal 2010 the adoption of Statement
    157 for nonfinancial assets (including items such as goodwill,
    other intangible assets and long-lived assets) and nonfinancial
    liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
    (at least annually). We do not currently anticipate that the
    adoption of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities will materially impact our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. See

Note 24: Fair Value Measurements

for disclosures
    required by Statement 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“Statement 159”). Statement 159 allows companies to
    voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure many
    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value (the
    “fair value option”). The election is made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
    for an instrument, all unrealized gains or losses in fair value
    for that instrument shall be reported in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. We adopted Statement 159 in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009 but have not elected the fair value
    option for any eligible financial instruments as of July 3,
    2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business
    Combinations” (“Statement 141R”). Statement 141R
    requires that, upon a business combination, the acquired assets,
    assumed liabilities, contractual contingencies and contingent
    liabilities be recognized and measured at their fair value at
    the acquisition date. Statement 141R also requires that
    acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the
    acquisition and expensed as incurred. In addition, Statement
    141R requires that acquired

in-process

research and development be measured at fair value and
    capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and it is
    therefore not subject to amortization until the project is
    completed or abandoned. Statement 141R also requires that
    changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired
    income tax uncertainties that are recognized after the
    measurement period be recognized in income tax expense.
    Statement 141R is to be applied prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or
    after December 15, 2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010,
    which started on July 4, 2009. While adoption of Statement
    141R is not expected to materially impact our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows directly,
    Statement 141R is expected to have a significant effect on the
    accounting for any acquisitions we make subsequent to
    July 3, 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133” (“Statement 161”).
    Statement 161 applies to all derivative instruments, including
    bifurcated derivative instruments (and to nonderivative
    instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
    instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of
    Statement 133) and related hedged items accounted for
    under Statement 133. Statement 161 amends and expands the
    disclosure requirements of Statement 133 to provide greater
    transparency as to (a) how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To
    meet those objectives, Statement 161 requires qualitative



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

disclosures about objectives and strategies for using
    derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the volume of
    derivative activity and fair value amounts of, and gains and
    losses on, derivative instruments including location of such
    amounts in the consolidated financial statements, and
    disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in
    derivative agreements. We adopted Statement 161 in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009, and there was no impact to our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

for disclosures required by Statement 161.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determining the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”
    (“FSP

FAS 142-3”).

FSP

FAS 142-3

amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal
    or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of
    recognized intangible assets accounted for pursuant to
    Statement 142. FSP

FAS 142-3

amends Statement 142 to require an entity to consider its own
    historical experience in renewing or extending similar
    arrangements, regardless of whether those arrangements have
    explicit renewal or extension provisions. In the absence of such
    experience, FSP

FAS 142-3

requires an entity to consider assumptions that market
    participants would use (consistent with the highest and best use
    of the asset by market participants), adjusted for
    entity-specific factors. FSP

FAS 142-3

also requires incremental disclosures for renewable intangible
    assets. FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010, which started on
    July 4, 2009. FSP

FAS 142-3

is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired
    after the effective date, and the incremental disclosure
    requirements for renewable intangible assets are to be applied
    prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and
    subsequent to, the effective date. While adoption of FSP FAS
    142-3 is not expected to materially impact our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows directly, the
    effect of FSP FAS 142-3 on the accounting for any acquisitions
    we make subsequent to July 3, 2009 will depend on the facts and
    circumstances of those acquisitions.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. Emerging Issues Task
    Force (“EITF”)

03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”
    (“FSP

EITF 03-6-1”).

FSP

EITF 03-6-1 states

that unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and,
    accordingly, should be included in the two-class method of
    calculating earnings per share (“EPS”) under Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings
    per Share.” FSP

EITF 03-6-1

also includes guidance on allocating earnings pursuant to the

two-class

method. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which for us is our fiscal 2010. All prior-period EPS data
    presented (including interim financial statements, summaries of
    earnings, and selected financial data) shall be adjusted
    retrospectively. We do not currently anticipate that the
    implementation of FSP

EITF 03-6-1

will materially impact our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 141R-1,

“Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in
    a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies”
    (“FSP

FAS 141R-1”).

Under FSP

FAS 141R-1,

assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination are to be recognized at fair value at the
    acquisition date if the acquisition-date fair value can be
    determined during the measurement period. In cases where
    acquisition-date fair values cannot be determined during the
    measurement period, an asset or liability shall be recognized at
    the acquisition date at amounts based on guidance in Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies” and FASB Interpretation No. 14,
    “Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss” if
    certain other criteria are met. FSP

FAS 141R-1

also expands the disclosure requirements of Statement 141R to
    provide additional information about business
    combination-related contingencies in footnotes describing
    business combinations. FSP

FAS 141R-1

is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for
    us is our fiscal 2010, which started on July 4, 2009. While
    adoption of FSP FAS 141R-1 is not expected to materially impact
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows
    directly, FSP FAS 141R-1 may have a significant effect on the
    accounting for any acquisitions we make subsequent to July 3,
    2009.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” (“FSP

FAS 107-1”).

FSP

FAS 107-1

extends the annual disclosure requirements of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, “Disclosures
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“Statement
    107”) to interim reporting periods. Statement 107 requires
    disclosures of the fair value of all financial instruments
    (whether recognized or not in the statement of financial
    position), except for those specifically listed in
    paragraph 8 of Statement 107, when practicable to do so. In
    addition, FSP

FAS 107-1

requires fair value information disclosed in the notes to
    financial statements to be presented together with the related
    carrying amount of the financial instruments in a form that
    clearly distinguishes between assets and liabilities and
    indicates how the carrying



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amounts relate to what is reported on the statement of financial
    position. An entity must also disclose the methods and
    significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
    financial instruments and describe any changes in these methods
    and significant assumptions. FSP

FAS 107-1

is effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, which for us is the first quarter of our
    fiscal 2010. We do not currently anticipate that the
    implementation of FSP

FAS 107-1

will materially impact our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 165, “Subsequent Events”
    (“Statement 165”). Statement 165 is intended to
    establish general standards of accounting for, and disclosure
    of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
    financial statements are issued, in the case of public entities.
    Specifically, Statement 165 sets forth the period after the
    balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity
    should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for
    potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements,
    the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events
    or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its
    financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should
    make about events or transactions that occurred after the
    balance sheet date. Statement 165 is effective for interim or
    annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, which
    for us was fiscal 2009 (which ended July 3, 2009). We
    adopted Statement 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and
    have evaluated any subsequent events through the date of filing
    of this Report (August 31, 2009), and there was no impact
    to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 168, “The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles — a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162” (“Statement 168”). Statement 168
    replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles” and establishes only two levels of
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”): authoritative and nonauthoritative. The FASB
    Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

(the “Codification”) will become the source of
    authoritative U.S. accounting principles recognized by the
    FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
    except for rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which continue to be
    sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All
    nongrandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in
    the Codification will become nonauthoritative. Statement 168 is
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after
    September 15, 2009, which for us is the first quarter of
    our fiscal 2010, at which time we will begin using the new
    guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the Codification
    when referring to GAAP. As the Codification is not intended to
    change existing GAAP for public entities, we do not currently
    anticipate that the implementation of Statement 168 will
    materially impact our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

NOTE 3:

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

On March 31, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved the Spin-off of all the shares of HSTX owned by us to
    our shareholders. On May 27, 2009, we completed the
    Spin-off through the distribution of our ownership of
    approximately 56 percent of the outstanding shares of HSTX
    in the form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders.
    Each of our shareholders received approximately 0.248418 of a
    share of HSTX Class A common stock for each share of our
    common stock such shareholder held as of 5:30 p.m. Eastern
    Time on May 13, 2009, the record date for the Spin-off. The
    distribution ratio was based on the number of shares of HSTX
    Class B common stock owned by us, which we exchanged for an
    equal number of shares of HSTX Class A common stock prior
    to the distribution in order to effect the Spin-off, divided by
    the number of shares of our common stock and common stock
    equivalents outstanding on the record date. Our shareholders of
    record on the record date received cash in lieu of any fraction
    of a HSTX share that they would have otherwise received in the
    Spin-off. In aggregate, we distributed 32,913,377 shares of
    HSTX Class A common stock to our shareholders. Based upon
    the $5.26 per share closing price for the HSTX Class A
    common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on May 26, 2009,
    the day prior to the date of the distribution, the aggregate
    market value of the shares distributed was $173.1 million.
    In accordance with Statement 144, our historical financial
    results have been restated to account for HSTX as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented in this Report.

Prior to the Spin-off of HSTX, as of the end of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009, based on the current global economic
    environment and the decline of the market capitalization of
    HSTX, we performed an interim review for impairment of
    HSTX’s goodwill and its other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, consisting solely of the Stratex trade name. To test for
    potential impairment of HSTX’s goodwill, we determined the
    fair value of HSTX based on projected discounted cash flows and
    market-based multiples applied to sales and earnings. The
    results indicated an impairment of goodwill because the current
    carrying value of the segment exceeded its fair value. We then
    allocated



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

this fair value to HSTX’s underlying assets and liabilities
    to determine the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a
    $279.0 million charge to write down all of HSTX’s
    goodwill. We determined the fair value of the Stratex trade name
    by performing a projected discounted cash flow analysis based on
    the relief-from-royalty approach, resulting in a
    $22.0 million charge to write down a majority of the
    carrying value of the Stratex trade name. Substantially all of
    the goodwill and the Stratex trade name were recorded in
    connection with the combination of Stratex and our Microwave
    Communications Division in January 2007.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2009 we made the following significant acquisition:

•

Acquisition of Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems
    Business

.  On May 29, 2009, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless
    systems business (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known
    as

M/A-COM),

an established provider of mission-critical wireless
    communications systems for law enforcement, fire and rescue,
    public service, utility and transportation markets. In
    connection with the acquisition, we assumed liabilities
    primarily related to Wireless Systems. We did not assume the
    State of New York wireless network contract awarded to Wireless
    Systems in December 2004. The purchase price for Wireless
    Systems was $665 million in cash, subject to further
    post-closing adjustments. We operate Wireless Systems, which we
    now call the Public Safety and Professional Communications
    business, within our RF Communications segment. We believe the
    acquisition creates a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market. Additional details, including calculation of the
    purchase price, identifiable intangible assets and Wireless
    Systems’ Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition
    date, are provided in the table and notes below.

The long-term contract liability recorded in the purchase price
    allocation is for a significant loss contract acquired with a
    single customer to build, deploy, own, operate and maintain a
    statewide network for 20 years, of which 12 years were
    remaining under the contract on the acquisition date.

In connection with our acquisition of Wireless Systems, we
    allocated $7.0 million of the purchase price to two
    in-process research and development projects. These allocations
    represent the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash
    flows related to these incomplete projects. In accordance with
    FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
    “Business Combinations,” these costs were expensed as
    a charge to earnings and are included in the “Engineering,
    selling and administrative expenses” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income. In making these purchase price
    allocations we relied on present value calculations of income,
    an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and
    an assessment of overall contribution and project risk. The
    value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
    development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
    the purchased in-process research and development into
    commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
    to their present value using a discount rate of 15 percent.
    The two in-process research and development



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

projects consisted of a new product platform and a new
    technology. As of the valuation date, the new product platform
    project was approximately 75 percent complete with a
    product launch expected at the end of calendar 2009 and had
    remaining costs until completion of approximately
    $2.1 million. As of the valuation date, the new technology
    project was approximately 80 percent complete with a
    product launch expected in early fiscal 2010 and had remaining
    costs until completion of approximately $1.1 million.

Pro
    Forma Results (Unaudited)

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
    our unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the
    acquisition of Wireless Systems had been completed as of the
    beginning of fiscal 2008, after including the impact of
    adjustments such as amortization of intangible assets, interest
    expense on related borrowings, and the related income tax
    effects. This pro forma presentation does not include any impact
    of transaction synergies.

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of our
    results of operations had we owned Wireless Systems for the
    entire periods presented. The decrease in Wireless Systems’
    contribution to our pro forma income from continuing operations
    in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 is primarily a result
    of higher radio sales in fiscal 2008 by Wireless Systems to
    Sprint Nextel related to the federally mandated 800 MHz band
    spectrum reconfiguration in order to reduce the frequency
    interference between public safety and commercial markets.
    Wireless Systems’ results for fiscal 2009 include after-tax
    charges of $0.8 million for integration costs associated
    with the acquisition.

During fiscal 2007 we made the following significant acquisition:

•

Acquisition of Multimax Incorporated.

On
    June 15, 2007, we acquired Multimax Incorporated
    (“Multimax”), a privately held provider of information
    technology and communications services for the
    U.S. Government. The acquisition of Multimax significantly
    expanded our information technology services
    business — providing greater scale, a broader customer
    base and new growth opportunities through key positions on
    Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts. We purchased Multimax for
    $402 million in cash. We recorded $115.0 million of
    identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a
    weighted average life of 10.0 years.

These business combinations have been accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, their results of
    operations have been included in our Consolidated Statement of
    Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows since their
    acquisition dates. The purchase price for Wireless Systems
    remains subject to further post-closing adjustments and the
    purchase price allocation is preliminary. The goodwill resulting
    from these business combinations was associated primarily with
    the acquired companies’ market presence and leading
    positions, growth opportunities in the markets in which the
    acquired companies operated, and experienced work forces and
    established operating infrastructures. The goodwill resulting
    from the Multimax acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes
    while the goodwill related to the Wireless Systems acquisition
    is deductible for tax purposes.

GOODWILL

As discussed in

Note 25: Business Segments

,
    effective upon the commencement of fiscal 2009, we changed our
    segment reporting structure, which resulted in changes in the
    goodwill balances by business segment as presented below. For
    those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, we
    applied the relative fair value method to determine the
    reallocation of goodwill to reporting units. Statement 142
    requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least
    annually and when reporting units are changed. During the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009, as a result of the changes to our
    segment reporting structure, we completed an assessment of any
    potential goodwill impairment under this new segment reporting
    structure and determined that no impairment existed.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with Statement 142, we also must test goodwill and
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets when events or
    circumstances indicate there may be an impairment charge. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for additional
    information regarding impairment of HSTX’s goodwill and its
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in fiscal

CREDIT
    ARRANGEMENTS

On September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any time and from time to time during the term of the
    2008 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
    time outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both
    revolving loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. This $750 million credit facility
    replaces our prior $500 million credit facility established
    pursuant to the five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit
    agreement we entered into on March 31, 2005 with a
    syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be
    guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We also may designate certain
    subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain
    of the covenants and representations in the 2008 Credit
    Agreement do not apply to such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on changes in the ratings of our
    senior, unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”) and on the degree of utilization under the 2008
    Credit Agreement (“Utilization”). The base rate is a
    fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate
    plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly
    announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest
    rate margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then the interest
    rate margin over the base rate will increase to either
    0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on Utilization.
    Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement denominated in a
    currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear interest at
    LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over LIBOR
    described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined based
    on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets; certain
    mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and
    leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing investments;
    and certain investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The 2008
    Credit Agreement also requires that we not permit our ratio of
    consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as
    defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and not permit our
    ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
    expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (measured
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). The 2008 Credit Agreement
    contains certain events of default, including: failure to make
    payments; failure to perform or observe terms, covenants and
    agreements; material inaccuracy of any representation or
    warranty; payment default under other indebtedness with a
    principal amount in excess of $75 million or acceleration
    of such indebtedness; occurrence of one or more final judgments
    or orders for the payment of money in excess of $75 million
    that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability
    in excess of $75 million; any bankruptcy or insolvency; or
    a change of control, including if a person or group becomes the
    beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock.
    If an event of default occurs the lenders may, among other
    things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 3, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had $105.7 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program, which is supported by the 2008 Credit Agreement.

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf registration
    statement, filed with the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to
    the potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $10.0 million from various international banks, the full
    amount of which was available on July 3, 2009. These lines
    provide for borrowings at various interest rates, typically may
    be terminated upon notice, may be used on such terms as mutually
    agreed to by the banks and us, and are reviewed annually for
    renewal or modification. These lines do not require compensating
    balances. We also have a short-term commercial paper program in
    place, which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash
    requirements and which is supported by our 2008 Credit
    Agreement. As of July 3, 2009, we had $105.7 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program.

NOTE 12:

SHORT-TERM

    Our short-term debt at June 27, 2008 was $0.3 million.
    The weighted-average interest rate for our short-term debt was

The potential maturities of long-term debt, including the
    current portion, for the five years following fiscal 2009 and,
    in total, thereafter are: $0.7 million in fiscal 2010;
    $0.7 million in fiscal 2011; $0.6 million in fiscal
    2012; $0.2 million in fiscal 2013; none in fiscal 2014; and
    $1,175.8 million thereafter. All of our outstanding
    long-term debt is unsubordinated and unsecured with equal
    ranking.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the
    notes, we entered into treasury lock agreements to protect
    against fluctuations in forecasted interest payments resulting
    from the issuance of ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in
    the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. In accordance with
    Statement 133, these agreements were determined to be highly
    effective in offsetting changes in forecasted interest payments
    as a result of changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate.
    Upon termination of these agreements on December 6, 2007,
    we recorded a loss of $5.5 million, net of income tax, in
    shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. This loss, along with $5.0 million in
    debt issuance costs, is being amortized on a straight-line basis
    over the life of the notes, which approximates the effective
    interest rate method, and is reflected as a portion of interest
    expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the
    option of the holders of the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

debentures. We may redeem the remaining $25.8 million in
    aggregate principal amount of the debentures in whole, or in
    part, at any time at a pre-determined redemption price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

STOCK
    OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of July 3, 2009, we had three shareholder-approved
    employee stock incentive plans (“SIPs”) under which
    options or other share-based compensation was outstanding, and
    we had the following types of share-based awards outstanding
    under our SIPs: stock options, performance share awards,
    performance share unit awards, restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock unit awards. We believe that such awards more
    closely align the interests of employees with those of
    shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated
    vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our
    SIPs).

Shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance
    under our SIPs totaled 21,531,236 as of July 3, 2009. In
    fiscal 2009, we issued an aggregate of 498,814 shares of
    common stock under the terms of our SIPs, which is net of shares
    withheld for tax purposes.

Stock
    Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under shareholder-approved SIPs. Option exercise
    prices are equal to or greater than the fair market value of our
    common stock on the date the options are granted, using the
    closing stock price of our common stock. Options may be
    exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally
    ranges from seven to ten years after the date of grant, and they
    generally become exercisable in installments, which are
    typically 50 percent one year from the grant date,
    25 percent two years from the grant date and
    25 percent three years from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which
    uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on
    our stock, historical volatility of our stock price over the
    last ten years and other factors. The expected term of the
    options is based on historical observations of our stock over
    the past ten years, considering average years to exercise for
    all options exercised, average years to cancellation for all
    options cancelled and average years remaining for outstanding
    options, which is calculated based on the weighted-average
    vesting period plus the weighted-average of the difference
    between the vesting period and average years to exercise and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

cancellation. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

    awards before and after the Spin-off. This was accounted for as
    a modification, and $4.1 million was recorded as non-cash
    compensation in fiscal 2009. The remaining $0.8 million of
    non-cash compensation will be recognized over the remaining
    vesting period.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value was $11.38 per share,
    $14.88 per share and $11.59 per share for options granted during
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total intrinsic
    value of options exercised during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $4.0 million, $46.8 million and $49.4 million,
    respectively, at the time of exercise.

    The total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $12.3 million,
    $12.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
    under our SIPs. The restricted stock and restricted stock units
    are not transferable until vested and the restrictions lapse
    upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified
    time period.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
    closing price of our stock on the date of grant and is amortized
    to compensation expense over its vesting period. At July 3,
    2009, there were 360,181 shares of restricted stock
    outstanding.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 3, 2009, we had 37,116 restricted stock units
    outstanding.

    1.18 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share
    of restricted stock and per unit of restricted stock units
    granted during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $50.57, $57.47 and
    $45.92, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that vested during fiscal 2009, 2008
    and 2007 was approximately $5.1 million, $3.5 million
    and $1.6 million, respectively.

Performance
    Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares and performance share units that have been granted to
    employees under our SIPs. Generally, performance share and
    performance share unit awards are subject to performance
    criteria such as meeting predetermined earnings and return on
    invested capital targets for a three-year plan period. These
    awards also generally vest at the expiration of the same
    three-year period. The final determination of the number of
    shares to be issued in respect of an award is determined by our
    Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of Directors.

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of our stock on the date of grant and is amortized to
    compensation expense over its vesting period, if achievement of
    the performance measures is considered probable. At July 3,
    2009, there were 662,216 performance shares outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 3, 2009, there were 53,552 performance share units
    outstanding.

employees were able to select an option to invest in
    Harris’ common stock at 70 percent of current market
    value limited to the lesser of (a) one percent of their
    eligible compensation and (b) 20 percent of a
    participant’s total contribution to the plan, which was
    matched by us. The discount from fair market value on common
    stock purchased by employees under our U.S. retirement
    plans was charged to compensation expense in the period of the
    related purchase. Effective in fiscal 2008, we no longer
    provided a discount to invest in our common stock.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due August
    2022. Holders of the debentures had the right to convert each of
    their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the
    stated maturity. During fiscal 2008, each holder received
    44.2404 shares of our common stock for each $1,000 of
    debentures surrendered for conversion. This represented a
    conversion price of $22.625 per share of our common stock. All
    outstanding debentures were either converted or redeemed during
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Potential dilutive common shares primarily consist of employee
    stock options. Employee stock options to purchase approximately
    4,113,850, 1,027,350 and zero shares of our stock were
    outstanding at the end of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, but were not included in the computation of net
    income per diluted share because the effect would have been
    antidilutive as the options’ exercise prices exceeded the
    average market price.

    incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require
    us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined
    performance or other specifications (such as designs).
    Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $759.2 million in fiscal 2009, $731.8 million in

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

We account for leases in accordance with the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases” and other related
    authoritative guidance. Total rental expense amounted to
    $33.4 million in fiscal 2009, $33.4 million in fiscal
    2008 and $27.2 million in fiscal 2007. Future minimum
    rental commitments under leases with an initial lease term in
    excess of one year, primarily for land and buildings, amounted
    to approximately $120.7 million at July 3, 2009. These
    commitments for the years following fiscal 2009 and, in total,
    thereafter are: fiscal 2010 — $29.5 million;
    fiscal 2011 — $20.1 million; fiscal
    2012 — $16.9 million; fiscal 2013 —
    $14.1 million; fiscal 2014 — $10.9 million;
    and $29.2 million thereafter. These commitments do not
    contain any material rent escalations, rent holidays, contingent
    rent, rent concessions, leasehold improvement incentives or
    unusual provisions or conditions. We do not consider any of
    these individual leases material to our operations. Leasehold
    improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during
    the lease term are amortized over the current lease term, or
    estimated life, if shorter.

NOTE 19:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. Statement 133 requires us to
    recognize all derivatives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    fair value. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading
    purposes.

At July 3, 2009, we had open foreign exchange contracts
    with a notional amount of $47.6 million, of which
    $20.2 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
    $27.4 million were classified as fair value hedges under
    the provisions of Statement 133. This compares with open foreign
    exchange contracts with a notional amount of $47.4 million
    at June 27, 2008, of which $30.7 million were
    classified as cash flow hedges and $16.7 million were
    classified as fair value hedges under the provisions of
    Statement 133. At July 3, 2009, contract expiration dates
    ranged from less than one month to 12 months with a
    weighted average contract life of 2 months.

Balance
    Sheet Hedges

To manage the exposure in our balance sheet to risks from
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we implement fair
    value hedges. We use foreign currency forward contracts and
    options to hedge certain balance sheet items, including foreign
    currency denominated accounts receivable and inventory. Changes
    in the value of the derivatives and the related hedged items are
    reflected in income, in the “Cost of product sales and
    services” line item in our Consolidated Statement of
    Income. As of July 3, 2009, we had outstanding foreign
    currency forward contracts denominated in the Euro, British
    Pound, Canadian Dollar and Singapore Dollar to hedge certain
    balance sheet items. The net gains on foreign exchange contracts
    designated as fair value hedges were not material in fiscal
    2009, 2008 or 2007. In addition, no amounts were recognized in
    our income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007 related to hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify
    as fair value hedges.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

To manage the exposure in our income statement to currency risk
    and market fluctuation risk associated with anticipated or
    forecasted cash flows that are probable of occurring in the
    future, we implement cash flow hedges. More specifically, we use
    foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge
    off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments, including
    purchase commitments from suppliers, future committed sales to
    customers and intercompany transactions. These derivatives are
    primarily being used to hedge currency exposures from cash flows
    anticipated in our RF Communications segment related to programs
    in the U.K., the Netherlands, Japan and China. We also have
    hedged U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
    anticipated profit margins in our international operations. As
    of July 3, 2009, we had outstanding foreign currency
    forward contracts and options denominated in the Euro, British
    Pound, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan Renminbi to hedge certain
    forecasted transactions.

These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
    of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
    anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
    effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
    anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives

impact of our derivatives is included in the same category in
    our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of
    the item being hedged.

A net gain of $2.0 million related to the effective portion
    of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash
    flow hedges was recognized in the “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss)” line item in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of July 3, 2009, which we estimate will be
    reclassified into net income from comprehensive income within
    the next 12 months. A net loss of $7.2 million was
    reclassified from the “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss)” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    to the “Cost of product sales and services” line item
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income in fiscal year 2009. The
    amount of gains or losses included in our income from continuing
    operations related to the ineffective portion of our cash flow
    hedges was not material in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Credit
    Risk

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
    by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
    based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single
    counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
    position with each counterparty.

IMPAIRMENT
    OF GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

In accordance with Statement 142, we test our goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as
    well as when we change reporting segments and when events or
    circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our annual review for
    impairment of our reporting units’ goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets. To test for potential
    impairment, we determined the fair



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value of our reporting units based on projected discounted cash
    flows and market-based multiples applied to sales and earnings.
    Because of the global recession and postponement of capital
    projects which significantly weakened demand, and the general
    decline of peer company valuations impacting our valuation, it
    appeared that goodwill in our Broadcast Communications segment
    was impaired, as the results of step one testing indicated the
    adjusted net book value of this segment exceeded its fair value.
    We then allocated this fair value to the Broadcast
    Communications segment’s underlying assets and liabilities
    to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.

In conjunction with the above-described impairment review, we
    conducted a review for impairment of Broadcast
    Communications’ other long-lived assets, including
    amortizable intangible assets and capitalized software, in
    accordance with Statement 144, as any impairment of these assets
    must be considered prior to the conclusion of the impairment
    review under Statement 142. The fair value of Broadcast
    Communications’ other long-lived assets were determined
    based on projected discounted cash flows based on future sales
    and operating costs, except for product trade names, in which
    case we projected discounted cash flows based on the
    relief-from-royalty method.

As a result of these impairment reviews, we determined that the
    goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and capitalized software
    for the Broadcast Communications segment were impaired.
    Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the
    Broadcast Communications segment recorded a $255.5 million
    impairment charge, consisting of charges of $160.9 million,
    $70.2 million and $24.4 million for impairment of
    goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and capitalized
    software, respectively.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    $338.5 million of undistributed earnings of international
    subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest those earnings
    indefinitely. Determination of unrecognized deferred
    U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and
    credit carryforwards as of July 3, 2009 have expiration
    dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
    instances. The amount of Federal, international, and state and
    local tax loss carryforwards as of July 3, 2009 were
    $4.7 million, $53.8 million and $7.7 million,
    respectively. Income (loss) from continuing operations before
    income taxes of international subsidiaries was
    $(59.3) million in fiscal 2009, $30.0 million in
    fiscal 2008 and $32.2 million in fiscal 2007. Income taxes
    paid were $308.4 million in fiscal 2009,
    $208.8 million in fiscal 2008 and $154.2 million in
    fiscal 2007. The valuation allowance decreased
    $11.9 million from $84.4 million at the end of fiscal
    2008 to $72.5 million at the end of fiscal 2009. The
    valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting
    purposes, to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax
    assets due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them
    in the future.

We adopted FIN 48 effective for fiscal 2008 (which began
    June 30, 2007). FIN 48 generally clarifies and sets
    forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain income tax
    positions in accordance with Statement 109. We recognized an
    immaterial cumulative effect adjustment reducing our liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties and
    increasing the June 30, 2007 balance of our retained
    earnings. The adoption also resulted in a reclassification of
    certain tax liabilities from current to non-current. A

As of July 3, 2009, we had $23.1 million of

    favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax
    benefits are eventually recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. We
    had accrued $2.7 million for the potential payment of
    interest and penalties as of June 27, 2008 (and this amount
    was not included in the $42.9 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits balance at June 27, 2008 shown above) and
    $1.9 million of this total could favorably impact future
    tax rates. We had accrued $3.4 million for the potential
    payment of interest and penalties as of July 3, 2009 (and
    this amount was not included in the $23.1 million

of unrecognized tax benefits balance at July 3, 2009 shown
    above) and $2.3 million of this total could favorably
    impact future tax rates.

We file numerous separate and consolidated income tax returns
    reporting our financial results and, where appropriate, those of
    our subsidiaries and affiliates, in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign
    jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Compliance Assurance Process, the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2010. We are currently under examination by the
    Canadian Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2003 through 2007, and
    we are appealing portions of a Canadian assessment relating to
    fiscal years 2000 through 2002. We are currently under
    examination by various state and international tax authorities
    for fiscal years ranging from 1990 through 2006. It is
    reasonably possible that there could be a significant decrease
    or increase to our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the
    course of the next twelve months as these examinations continue,
    other tax examinations commence or various statutes of
    limitations expire. An estimate of the range of possible changes
    cannot be made because of the significant number of
    jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax
    periods.

NOTE 24:

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

We adopted Statement 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and
    there was no impact to our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. In accordance with FSP

FAS 157-2,

we elected to defer until fiscal 2010 the adoption of Statement
    157 for nonfinancial assets (including items such as goodwill,
    other intangible assets and long-lived assets) and nonfinancial
    liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
    (at least annually). Statement 157 defines fair value as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in the principal market (or most
    advantageous market, in the absence of a principal market) for
    the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date. Statement 157 requires
    entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
    the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value and
    establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
    the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of
    inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted
    prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for
    similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
    for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
    are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are
    observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by,
    observable market data by correlation or other means.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities, and reflect our own
    assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best
    information available in the circumstances.

The following table represents the fair value hierarchy of our
    financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis (at least annually) as of
    July 3, 2009:

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our continuing operations in the following
    three business segments — RF Communications,
    Government Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications.
    Our RF Communications segment is a global supplier of secure
    tactical radio communications and embedded high-grade encryption
    solutions for military and government organizations and also of
    secured communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. Our Government
    Communications Systems segment conducts advanced research
    studies and produces, integrates and supports highly reliable,
    net-centric communications and information technology that solve
    the mission-critical challenges of our defense, intelligence and
    civilian U.S. Government customers. Our Broadcast
    Communications segment serves the global digital and analog
    media markets, providing infrastructure and networking products
    and solutions, media and workflow solutions, and television and
    radio transmission equipment and systems. Within each of our
    business segments, there are multiple program areas and product
    lines that aggregate into our three business segments described
    above.

Our segment reporting structure for fiscal 2009 reflects that,
    effective upon commencement of fiscal 2009, our RF
    Communications business (part of our Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment for fiscal 2008) is reported as its own
    separate segment, and our Defense Programs business (the other
    part of our Defense Communications and Electronics segment for
    fiscal 2008) is reported as part of our Government
    Communications Systems segment. Our Broadcast Communications
    segment did not change as a result of those adjustments to our
    segment reporting structure. The historical results, discussion
    and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Report reflect the impact of those adjustments to our segment
    reporting structure for all periods presented in this Report.

Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in
    connection with the May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a
    taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all the shares
    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting
    segment our former HSTX segment, which is reported as
    discontinued operations in this Report. Until the Spin-off, HSTX
    (formerly our Microwave Communications segment), a provider of
    wireless network solutions, was our majority-owned subsidiary,
    and HSTX’s results of operations and financial position
    were consolidated into our financial statements. Subsequent to
    the Spin-off, we no longer own an equity interest in HSTX and,
    therefore, HSTX no longer constitutes part of our business
    operations. In accordance with Statement 144, our historical
    financial results have been restated to account for HSTX as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in this
    Report. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for
    additional information regarding discontinued operations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

. We evaluate each segment’s performance based
    on its “operating income (loss),” which we define as
    profit or loss from operations before income taxes excluding
    interest income and expense, royalties and related intellectual
    property expenses, equity income and gains or losses from
    securities and other investments. Intersegment sales among our
    segments are transferred at cost to the buying segment and the
    sourcing segment recognizes a normal profit that is eliminated.
    The “Corporate eliminations” line item in the tables
    below represents the elimination of intersegment sales and their
    related profits. The “Unallocated corporate expense”
    line item in the tables below represents the portion of
    corporate expenses not allocated to the business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
    States with international revenue derived primarily from
    exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
    exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2009,
    2008 or 2007.

Sales made to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, by all segments (primarily our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments)
    as a percentage of total revenue were 79.4 percent in
    fiscal 2009, 78.9 percent in fiscal 2008 and
    74.8 percent in fiscal 2007. Revenue from services in
    fiscal 2009 was approximately 4.0 percent,
    35.1 percent and 11.4 percent of total revenue in our
    RF Communications, Government Communications Systems and
    Broadcast Communications segments, respectively.

NOTE 26:

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
    of businesses in which we are, or were, engaged, various claims
    or charges are asserted and litigation commenced by or against
    us arising from or related to matters including, but not limited
    to: product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks,
    trade secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee
    disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
    products containing asbestos or other restricted materials;
    breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed amounts
    against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable
    relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any
    real risk of court or arbitral awards. We typically record
    accruals for losses related to those matters against us that we
    consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated.
    Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are
    realized and legal costs are expensed when incurred. While it is
    not feasible to predict the outcome of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or
    proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us,
    based upon available information, in the opinion of management,
    settlements and final judgments, if any, which are considered
    probable of being rendered against us in litigation or
    arbitration in existence at July 3, 2009 are reserved for,
    covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in
    jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result
    in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently
    resolved with the authorities or ultimately through established
    legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any
    ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits;
    however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the
    amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
    the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the
    effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
    procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
    circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
    Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
    can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control
    objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures. As required by

Rule 13a-15

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2009, we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This
    evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this work
    and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has
    concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2009 our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We
    periodically review our internal control over financial
    reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal
    control over financial reporting to identify potential changes
    to our processes and systems that may improve controls and
    increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an
    effective internal control environment. Changes may include such
    activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
    consolidating the activities of business units, migrating
    certain processes to our shared services organizations,
    formalizing policies and procedures, improving segregation of
    duties, and adding additional monitoring controls. In addition,
    when we acquire new businesses, we incorporate our controls and
    procedures into the acquired business as part of our integration
    activities. There have been no changes in our internal control
    over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    July 3, 2009 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
    assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of the end of fiscal 2009 and concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of the end of fiscal 2009. “Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included
    within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report. The effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting was audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm. Their unqualified report is included within
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report.

    be granted under the Harris Corporation Stock Incentive Plan or
    the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

Under the Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in
    addition to options, we have granted share-based compensation
    awards in the form of performance shares, restricted stock,
    performance share units, restricted stock units, or other
    similar types of share awards. As of July 3, 2009, there
    were 1,113,065 such awards outstanding under that plan. The
    outstanding awards consisted of (i) 1,022,397 performance
    share awards and restricted stock awards, for which all
    1,022,397 shares were issued and outstanding; and
    (ii) 90,668 performance share unit awards and restricted
    stock unit awards, for which all 90,668 were payable in shares
    but for which no shares were yet issued and outstanding. The
    6,017,226 shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding
    options, warrants and rights as listed in column
    (a) consisted of shares to be issued in respect of the
    exercise of 5,926,558 outstanding options and in respect of the
    90,668 performance share unit awards and restricted stock units
    awards payable in shares. Because there is no exercise price
    associated with performance share awards or restricted stock
    awards or with performance share units awards or restricted
    stock unit awards, all of which are granted to employees at no
    cost, such awards are not included in the weighted average
    exercise price calculation in column (b).
