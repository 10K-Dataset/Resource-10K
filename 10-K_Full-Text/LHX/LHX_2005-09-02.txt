PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is an
international communications and information technology company
focused on providing assured communications products, systems
and services for government and commercial customers. Our
operating divisions serve markets for government communications,
secure tactical radio, microwave and broadcast systems.

Harris was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to
three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal executive
offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne,
Florida 32919, and our telephone number is (321) 727-9100.
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol “HRS.” On August 19, 2005, we employed
approximately 12,600 people. We sell products in more than
150 countries. Unless the context otherwise requires, the
terms “we,” “our,” “us,”
“Company,” and “Harris” as used in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Harris and its
subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations around the following four business
segments: (1) Government Communications Systems,
(2) RF Communications, (3) Microwave Communications,
and (4) Broadcast Communications. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, in conjunction with the sale of our tools and test
systems (“TTS”) product line, we changed our segment
reporting structure by eliminating the Network Support segment
as a separate reportable segment. The TTS product line is
reported as a discontinued operation, and the NetBoss®
network operations software business, which was part of the
Network Support segment, has been consolidated into the
Microwave Communications segment. Segment information for all
periods presented has been reclassified to reflect such segment
reporting structure. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K relate only to our continuing
operations. Financial information with respect to all of our
other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
part of Headquarters Expense or Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Each of our business segments, which we also refer to as
“divisions,” has been organized on the basis of
specific communications markets. Each operating segment has its
own marketing, engineering, manufacturing and product service
and maintenance organization. We produce most of the products we
sell.

Our total revenue in fiscal 2005 was approximately
$3.0 billion compared to approximately $2.5 billion in
fiscal 2004. Total revenue in the United States increased
approximately 19 percent from fiscal 2004 while
international revenue, which amounted to approximately
19 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2005, increased



approximately 10 percent from fiscal 2004. Our net income
from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was
$202.2 million compared to $125.7 million in fiscal
2004, an increase of 61 percent.

Recent Developments

Acquisition of The Orkand Corporation.

On July 6,
2004, which was the first business day of our 2005 fiscal year,
we acquired The Orkand Corporation (“Orkand”), a
privately-held provider of technical services and information
technology for U.S. Government agencies, including the
Department of State, Department of Labor, Department of the
Interior, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
Energy and the U.S. Postal Service. The purchase price for
Orkand, including assumed liabilities, was approximately
$80.6 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. The Orkand business is being operated within our
Government Communications Systems segment.

Acquisition of Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc.

On
November 3, 2004, we acquired Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc.
(“Encoda”), a privately-held, global supplier of
enterprise software solutions and services for the broadcast
media industry, with television, radio, cable, satellite and
advertising agency customers around the world. Encoda’s
end-to-end workflow solutions include traffic and billing
systems, program-scheduling systems, and automation and media
asset management solutions that are complementary to our
existing automation business. The purchase price for Encoda,
including assumed liabilities, was approximately
$411.6 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. The Encoda business is being operated within our
Broadcast Communications segment.

Subsequent Event — Agreement with Leitch Technology
Corporation

On August 31, 2005, we announced that we entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares of Leitch
Technology Corporation (“Leitch”), a provider of
high-performance video systems for the television broadcast
industry, including routers and distribution equipment, signal
processing, signal management and monitoring, servers and
storage area networks, branding software and post-production
editing systems. Total price consideration, net of cash on hand,
will be approximately $450 million excluding acquisition
costs. The acquisition is to be completed by way of a statutory
plan of arrangement and is subject to approval by Leitch
shareholders, customary regulatory and court approvals, and
other closing conditions. Following the consummation of the
transaction, Leitch will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harris.
The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter
of our 2006 fiscal year. The amount of consideration to the
former shareholders and option holders of Leitch will be paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents as well as
borrowings under our available credit arrangements. Leitch
reported revenue of approximately $183 million for its
fiscal year ended April 30, 2005. We expect that Leitch
will be operated within our Broadcast Communications segment.

Description of Business by Segment

Government Communications Systems

Government Communications Systems designs, develops and supports
state-of-the-art communications and information networks and
equipment; plays a key role in developing intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance solutions; designs and supports
information systems for image and other data collection,
processing, interpretation, storage and retrieval; and offers
engineering, operations and support services. This segment
serves a diversified customer base within the
U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense,
Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Census
Bureau, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(“NGA”), Department of State, Department of Homeland
Security, National Security Agency (“NSA”), National
Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”), and other government
agencies. Government Communications Systems also provides
services, systems and products for other aerospace and defense
companies. The Government Communications Systems segment serves
four strategic program areas:

Department of Defense Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a major supplier of spaceborne communications and
information processing systems, including large deployable
satellite antenna systems, and flat-panel, phased-array and
single-mission antennas. Harris is a supplier of high-frequency
satellite



ground terminals for the U.S. Department of Defense,
supplying the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. Currently in
the design phase is the U.S. Air Force’s Family of
Beyond Line-of-Sight (“FAB-T”) program, awarded to us
in 2002, with Harris providing terminal and antenna hardware
integration and operator interface development for both aircraft
and ground satellite terminals. The FAB-T program will provide
the warfighter with protected, wideband satellite communications
on strategic aircraft and at remote ground, fixed and mobile
command and control centers. The FAB-T terminals employ the
innovative software-defined radio architecture employed in the
Joint Tactical Radio System program. During fiscal 2005,
Government Communications Systems was awarded contracts on two
next-generation aerial surveillance platforms — the
Battle Management Command and Control segment for the
U.S. Air Force E-10A aircraft, and the
U.S. Army’s Aerial Common Sensor (“ACS”)
program. As part of the ACS program, we were awarded a
$75 million, three-year, communications integration
contract, with a follow-on potential value of $500 million
over 20 years. U.S. Department of Defense programs
awarded in fiscal 2005 also include a potential
$350 million, 10-year program to provide tactical common
data links for the U.S. Navy LAMPS helicopters, and a
three-year contract to provide large unfurlable spaceborne
antennas for the Mobile User Objective System, a narrowband
tactical satellite communications system that will enhance the
U.S. Navy’s existing satellite tactical communications
system. Ongoing programs also include: a contract with the
U.S. Navy for multi-band shipboard satellite terminals
(“MSSCT”); a contract to develop four prototypes for
the next-generation Advanced Extremely High Frequency
(“AEHF”) Multi-Band Terminals for the U.S. Navy;
contracts for portions of the communications systems for the
Ground-based Midcourse Defense (“GMD”) program
(formerly known as National Missile Defense); follow-on awards
for the U.S. Army’s Multiple Launch Rocket System
program; a contract for Multi-function Information Distribution
Systems (“MIDS”) terminals for aircraft such as the
U.S. Navy’s F/ A-18 and U.S. Air Force’s
F-16 as well as ground-based applications; and contracts for the
F/ A-22 Raptor, F/ A-18E/ F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft platforms to provide
high-performance avionics such as high-speed fiber optic
networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image
processing, digital map software and other electronic components.

National Security Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a provider of communications equipment and systems,
and image and information processing solutions to national
intelligence and security agencies and customers. We provide
comprehensive solutions for intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance. A significant portion of this program area
involves classified programs. While classified programs
generally are not discussed in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the operating results relating to classified
programs are included in our consolidated financial statements,
and the business risks associated with such programs do not
differ materially from those of other programs for the
U.S. Government. During fiscal 2005, Harris was awarded a
three-year, potential $77 million program for the NSA to
develop a new system for its analysts. Government Communications
Systems is also supplying geospatial and imagery-derived
products for the NGA under the Global Geospatial Intelligence
program, including foundation data products, mapping and
charting production services, surveying services and production
management.

Civil Programs:

Government Communications Systems is a
supplier to civilian agencies of the U.S. Government,
supplying these agencies with custom systems and software
designed to collect, store, retrieve, process, analyze,
interpret, display and distribute information, including
meteorological data processing systems, electronic archival
systems, graphic information systems, and telecommunication
services systems. Government Communications Systems is assisting
the FAA in modernizing the U.S. air traffic control system
and infrastructure. We are the prime contractor on a 15-year,
$1.9 billion contract to integrate and modernize the
FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure (“FTI”).
This program will consolidate telecommunications at more than
5,000 FAA facilities nationwide, while reducing operating costs,
enhancing network security and improving service. During fiscal
2005, we were awarded a further contract by the FAA valued at
$275 million to add mission support services to the FTI
program as well as a follow-on contract for the FAA’s
Weather and Advanced Radar Processing System. The total contract
amount for the FTI program, including options, could reach
$3.5 billion through 2017. We are also working with the FAA
on other programs, including the Voice Switching and Control
System program, which allows air traffic controllers to
establish critical air-to-ground and ground-to-ground
communications with pilots as well as other air traffic
controllers. Government Communications Systems is the prime
contractor for the U.S. Census Bureau’s Master Address
File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project
(“MAF/TIGER”). Currently anticipated to provide total
revenue of $210 million over an eight-year period ending in
2010, the MAF/ TIGER program will provide a computer database of
all addresses and locations where people live or work, covering
an estimated 115 million residences and 60 million
businesses in the U.S. During fiscal 2005, Government
Communications Systems, together with Broadcast Communications,
completed a contract to rebuild the Iraqi



Media Network (“IMN”), which is bringing modern radio,
TV broadcast and newspaper infrastructure and media content to
the people of Iraq.

Technical Services Programs:

Government Communications
Systems is a leader in providing technical engineering,
operations and services to the U.S. Government. Such
services include information technology outsourcing, enterprise
management, and systems design. During fiscal 2005, we were
selected by the NRO to provide operations, maintenance and
support services for the agency’s global communications and
information systems (“Patriot” program). This program
has a potential value of $1 billion over 10 years. We
were also awarded a contract with a potential value of
$175 million, over nine years, from the Defense Information
Systems Agency in support of its Crisis Management System. Under
the Mission Communications Operations and Maintenance
(“MCOM”) program, operations and maintenance services
are provided for the U.S. Air Force Satellite Control
Network’s communications functions at Schriever AFB,
Colorado, and Onizuka AFS, California. Under the Operational
Space Services and Support program (“OSSS”),
operations and maintenance are provided to the Air Force
Satellite Control Network remote tracking stations and global
positioning satellite sites worldwide. During the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, Harris completed the acquisition of Orkand, a
privately-held provider of technical services and information
technology for U.S. Government agencies, including the
Department of State, Department of Labor, Department of the
Interior, Department of Health and Human Services, and
Department of Energy. The acquisition of Orkand is providing
insight into additional opportunities with these new customers.

Revenue, Backlog and Contracts:

Revenue in fiscal 2005
for the Government Communications Systems segment increased
20 percent to $1,805 million from $1,506 million
in fiscal 2004. Segment operating income increased
33 percent to $203.4 million from $153.4 million
in fiscal 2004. This segment contributed 60 percent of our
total revenue in fiscal 2005, 60 percent in fiscal 2004 and
55 percent in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2005, approximately
28 percent of the revenue for this segment was under
contracts with prime contractors and approximately
72 percent was under direct contracts with customers. Some
of this segment’s significant programs in terms of revenue
in fiscal 2005 included the FTI program, the Patriot program,
the IMN program and various technical services programs acquired
as part of the Orkand acquisition. Other programs contributing
to revenue included the ACS, AEHF, F/ A-18E/F, IFCS, MAF/ TIGER,
MIDS, MSSCT and several classified programs. The largest program
by revenue represented approximately 6 percent of this
segment’s revenue for fiscal 2005 and approximately
5 percent for fiscal 2004. The 10 largest programs by
revenue represented approximately 31 percent of this
segment’s revenue in fiscal 2005 and approximately
30 percent for fiscal 2004. This segment currently has a
diverse portfolio of approximately 300 programs, each having a
value over $1 million. In fiscal 2005, U.S. Government
customers, whether directly or through prime contractors,
accounted for approximately 91 percent of this
segment’s total revenue.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$410 million at July 29, 2005, compared with
$463 million at July 30, 2004. Substantially all this
backlog is expected to be filled during fiscal 2006.

Most of the sales of Government Communications Systems are made
directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under
contracts or subcontracts containing standard government
contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if
applicable, and for termination at the convenience of the
U.S. Government or for default of the contractor. This
segment’s contracts include both cost-reimbursement and
fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for
the reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee.
These contracts fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus
fixed-fee contracts, which provide for the payment of a fixed
fee irrespective of the final cost of performance;
(ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for
increases or decreases in the fee, within specified limits,
based upon actual results compared to contractual targets
relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery
schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which
provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
contractor against pre-established performance criteria. Under
cost-reimbursement contracts, this segment is reimbursed
periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the
fee based on contract progress.

This segment’s fixed-price contracts are either firm
fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
firm fixed-price contracts, this segment agrees to perform a
specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result,
benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of cost
overruns. Under fixed-price incentive contracts, this segment
shares with the U.S. Government both savings accrued from
contracts performed for less than target costs as well as costs
incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price
(which is higher than the target cost), but carries the entire
burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be
adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified



performance objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and
fixed-price incentive contracts, this segment usually receives
either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the
contract price or monthly progress payments from the
U.S. Government in amounts equaling 75 percent of
costs incurred under U.S. Government contracts. The
remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are
billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and
deliverables under the contract. Fixed-price contracts generally
have higher profit margins than cost-reimbursement contracts.
Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and
development contracts are generally cost-reimbursement
contracts. For fiscal 2005, 60 percent of the revenue of
this segment were generated from cost-reimbursement contracts
and 40 percent were generated from fixed-price contracts
compared to 68 percent and 32 percent, respectively,
in fiscal 2004. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this
segment, see “Business — Principal Customers;
Government Contracts,” “Legal Proceedings” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

RF Communications

RF Communications is a worldwide supplier of secure voice and
data radio communications products, systems and networks to the
U.S. Department of Defense, Federal and state agencies, and
government defense agencies. RF Communications offers a
comprehensive line of secure radio products and systems for
manpack, handheld, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
applications. These radio systems are highly flexible,
interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission
requirements.

RF Communications’ Falcon® II family of secure
high-frequency, very high-frequency and ultra high-frequency and
multiband software-defined tactical radios is built on a
software-defined radio platform that is reprogrammable to add
features or software upgrades. Software-defined radio technology
offers significantly increased flexibility in support of a
variety of wireless communications protocols. These radios also
have military-strength embedded encryption and can be linked to
computers, providing network capabilities on the battlefield.

RF Communications provides embedded encryption. Its
Sierra

tm

II
cryptographic subsystem is a miniaturized programmable module
that can be integrated into radios and other voice and data
communications devices to encrypt classified information prior
to transmission and storage.
Sierra

tm

II
was certified in fiscal 2005 by the NSA. RF Communications
encryption modules currently meet or exceed the highest security
standards established by the U.S. Government.

The ongoing war on terror and the resulting worldwide
transformation to modernize tactical communications to provide
secure, interoperable and reliable communications are driving
strong demand and positive results for this segment. Force
modernization efforts including ground force restructuring and
expansion have gained increasing momentum and funding as the
U.S. Department of Defense seeks to deliver enhanced
command, control and communications to more and smaller
operating units. In fiscal 2005, RF Communications responded to
requirements for its industry-leading Falcon® II
radios from a broad base of U.S. Government customers. For
example, the U.S. Army’s Modularity program is a major
force-transformation initiative that includes smaller, more
agile and rapidly deployable fighting units. The smaller units
are more independent and require greater capabilities for
communications up and down the command structure, which has
created demand for our Falcon II® radios. Similar
communications modernization programs are under way by the
U.S. Marines, the Army Reserve and the National Guard.
Internationally, RF Communications’ radios are the standard
of NATO and Partnership for Peace countries. Sales in fiscal
2005 were made to NATO members, including Romania, Denmark,
Estonia, Canada, Latvia, Bulgaria, Norway, and Netherlands.
Additionally, sales in fiscal 2005 were made to the following
countries: Pakistan, Philippines, United Arab Emirates, Malawi,
Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Macedonia, and Sweden.

RF Communications has a key position on the next-generation,
U.K. Ministry of Defence Bowman Tactical Radio Programme
(“Bowman”). Under the terms of the Bowman contract
with General Dynamics United Kingdom Limited, valued at
approximately $245 million, this segment is expected to
provide more than 10,000 high-frequency radio units over
the course of the five-year program. Production for Bowman began
in fiscal 2003. Although the program, which is in early
development, has been delayed, RF Communications has a key
position on the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Tactical
Radio System (“JTRS”) program.

Revenue in fiscal 2005 for the RF Communications segment
increased 25 percent over fiscal 2004 to $537 million
from $430 million. Segment operating income increased
40 percent to $166.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared
to $118.9 million in fiscal 2004. The RF Communications
segment contributed 17 percent of our total revenue in
fiscal 2005, 17 percent in fiscal 2004 and 16 percent
in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2005, approximately



45 percent of the sales of this segment were made outside
of the United States, compared to 47 percent
in fiscal 2004.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
serviced directly to customers through its sales organizations
and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
this segment markets and sells its products and services through
regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
See “Business — International Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$427 million at July 29, 2005, compared with
$331 million at July 30, 2004. Approximately
75 percent of this backlog of unfilled orders is expected
to be filled during fiscal 2006. For a discussion of certain
risks affecting this segment, see “Business —
Principal Customers; Government Contracts”, “Legal
Proceedings” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

our TTS business during fiscal 2004, the NetBoss® network
operations software product line has become part of the
Microwave Communications segment and prior periods have been
restated to reflect this change.

Principal customers for Microwave Communications’ products
and services include domestic and international cellular/mobile
service providers, original equipment manufacturers, as well as
private network users such as public safety agencies, utilities,
pipelines, railroads and other industrial enterprises.
Approximately 46 percent of the sales of this segment were
made outside of North America in fiscal 2005 compared to
52 percent in fiscal 2004. In general, this segment’s
North American products and services are sold directly to
customers through its sales organizations and through
established distribution channels. Internationally, this segment
markets and sells its products and services through regional
sales offices and established distribution channels. See
“Business — International Business.”



Revenue in fiscal 2005 for the Microwave Communications segment
decreased 3 percent from $330 million in fiscal 2004
to $320 million in fiscal 2005. This segment’s
operating income was $7.7 million in fiscal 2005, compared
to an operating loss of $12.1 million in fiscal 2004. The
Microwave Communications segment contributed 11 percent of
our total revenue in fiscal 2005, 13 percent in fiscal 2004
and 14 percent in fiscal 2003.

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$94 million at July 29, 2005, compared with
$81 million at July 30, 2004. Substantially all of
this backlog is expected to be filled during fiscal 2006. For a
discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, see
“Legal Proceedings” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

Broadcast Communications

Broadcast Communications’ hardware and software solutions
support the entire content creation, management, distribution,
and delivery process for broadcast, cable, satellite, and other
media content providers. The segment serves the global digital
and analog markets, providing enterprise software, studio,
network management, and transmission equipment and systems.

The future of broadcast media involves digitizing content and
transporting it simultaneously over many different networks to
many types of devices. This transition from analog to digital
technology enables content owners and service providers to
consolidate and automate their operations. As a result, this
need to create, manage, and ultimately deliver digital media
content is driving an infrastructure upgrade cycle for the
media industry.

Broadcast Communications develops, manufactures, and supplies
digital and analog television transmission equipment for
over-the-air broadcasters and for the emerging mobile television
market. In addition to high definition picture clarity, digital
technology gives broadcasters the opportunity to expand channel
and service offerings. In response to the
U.S. Government-mandated transition from analog to digital
transmission, Broadcast Communications provided the
nation’s first advanced digital television transmitter as
well as the first commercial digital television application and
is a leader with respect to the U.S. digital standard known
as “ATSC.” Among others, innovations have included the
development of a line of analog transmitters that can be
upgraded for digital operation in the field. Additionally, we
continue to develop next-generation transmission equipment to
provide broadcasters with a smooth path from analog to digital
broadcasting and in fiscal 2005 introduced
PowerCD

tm

,
a new family of high-power UHF ATSC transmitters designed to
deliver maximum in-band RF power per watt of electricity. The
segment is also a provider of European-standard digital
“DVB-T” transmission equipment supported by a
technology development center in Austria that focuses on
European-standard DVB-T transmissions systems. We are also
expanding our efforts to reach the emerging mobile television
market under the concept of transmitting real-time television to
personal devices such as cell phones or PDAs. In fiscal 2005 the
segment began development and provided transmission equipment
for various mobile video broadcasting trials in the U.S., UK,
Australia, and China.

Broadcast Communications develops, manufactures, and supplies
end-to-end products, systems, and services for the radio
broadcast market. Product offerings include digital and analog
transmission equipment, audio and networking consoles, studio
products, monitoring and control solutions, and systems that
range from single radio studios to consolidated operations and
complete nationwide networks with hundreds of radio sites. We
are a leader in the transition from analog to digital radio.
Product offerings address the U.S. digital standard called
IBOC (In-Band/ On-Channel), which is referred to in the market
as HD
Radio

tm

,
as well as international digital standards including DAB
(digital audio broadcasting) and DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale).
The rollout of HD Radio in the U.S. is progressing
with approximately 2,500 of 13,000 radio stations committing to
implement HD Radio over the next several years and
approximately 400 stations currently on-air. During fiscal 2005,
the segment introduced its second-generation transmission
product family called
FLEXSTAR

tm

,
which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so broadcasters
can offer supplemental audio and data capability along with the
main program stream. This enables broadcasters to develop new
revenue-generating opportunities including multiple programs on
the same channel, 5.1 surround sound, on-demand traffic, weather
and sports reports, store-and-play capabilities, and real-time
navigation.

Broadcast Communications’ software systems offering, which
was significantly expanded with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of
Encoda Systems, enables customers to better manage their digital
media workflow through a portfolio of software products for
traffic, scheduling and billing, as well as for complementary
automation and digital asset management solutions. Initial
modules of the next-generation digital content delivery
platform, called H-Class, were also launched during fiscal 2005.
The H-Class software system is an enterprise platform



which can intelligently manage delivery of rich digital media
across multiple networks, channels, formats, and devices.
H-Class provides broadcasters and other media, entertainment,
and content distribution customers with a means to integrate
disparate processes from creation to consumption into a single,
modular system.

Networking solutions provide routing and distribution, signal
processing, and network monitoring and management tools for
multiple markets. In addition to providing solutions to the
traditional broadcast and cable markets, customers also include
the U.S. Government and public safety organizations for
mission-critical, first-response scenarios. For example,
Broadcast Communications, in conjunction with Government
Communications Systems, is providing extensive networking
solutions for the FTI program. Rapidly growing demand for
content over an increasing number of devices is driving a
transition from single, dedicated networks to flexible systems
that automatically deliver content over the most appropriate and
cost-effective network, transporting the right content to the
right person on the right device.

Principal customers for Broadcast Communications’ products
and services include domestic and international television and
radio broadcast networks and content originators. Revenue for
the Broadcast Communications segment increased 34 percent
from $287 million in fiscal 2004 to $384 million in
fiscal 2005. Segment operating income was $18.1 million in
fiscal 2005 compared to $8.1 million in fiscal 2004. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Broadcast Communications
segment decided to exit its unprofitable TV systems integration
business, which contributed approximately $13 million in
revenue in fiscal 2004. The Broadcast Communications segment
contributed 12 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2005,
11 percent in fiscal 2004 and 15 percent in fiscal
2003. Approximately 34 percent of the sales of this segment
were made outside of the United States in fiscal 2005, compared
to 39 percent in fiscal 2004.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
serviced directly to customers through its sales organizations
and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
this segment markets and sells its products and services through
regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
See “Business — International Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
$210 million at July 29, 2005, compared with
$105 million at July 30, 2004. Approximately
70 percent of this backlog is expected to be filled during
fiscal 2006. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this
segment, see “Legal Proceedings” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

International Business

Revenue in fiscal 2005 from products exported from the United
States (including foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad
was $559.0 million (19 percent of our total revenue),
compared with $507.5 million (20 percent of our total
revenue) in fiscal 2004 and $422.8 million (21 percent
of our total revenue) in fiscal 2003. Our international sales
include both direct exports from the United States and sales
from foreign subsidiaries. Most of the international sales are
derived from the Microwave Communications, RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments. Direct export sales are
primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from
foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local
currency of the subsidiary. Exports from the United States,
principally to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, totaled
$326.6 million (58 percent of our international sales)
in fiscal 2005, $308.6 million (61 percent of our
international sales) in fiscal 2004 and $222.7 million
(53 percent of our international sales) in fiscal 2003.
Foreign operations represented 8 percent of revenue in
fiscal 2005, 8 percent of revenue in fiscal 2004 and
10 percent of revenue in fiscal 2003, and 9 percent of
long-lived assets as of July 1, 2005 and 16 percent of
long-lived assets as of July 2, 2004. Financial information
regarding our domestic and international operations is contained
in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Principal international manufacturing facilities are located in
Canada, China and the United Kingdom. International marketing
activities are conducted through subsidiaries which operate in
Canada, Europe, Central and South America and Asia. We have also
established international marketing organizations and several
regional sales offices. Reference is made to Exhibit 21
“Subsidiaries of the Registrant” for further
information regarding our foreign subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
established by the independent representative and may be above
or below our list prices. These independent representatives
generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark
up those prices in setting the final sales prices



paid by the customer. During fiscal 2005, revenue from indirect
sales channels represented 6 percent of our total revenue
and 32 percent of our international revenue, compared to
revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2004 representing
6 percent of our total revenue and 30 percent of our
international revenue.

Fiscal 2005 revenue came from a large number of foreign
countries, no one of which accounted for 3 percent or more
of our total revenue. Certain of our exports are paid for by
letters of credit, with the balance carried either on an open
account or installment note basis. Advance payments, progress
payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon
shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
Performance guarantees by us are generally required on
significant foreign government contracts. In order to stay
competitive in international markets, we also enter into
recourse and vendor financing to facilitate sales to certain
customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
the overall business risk for the international business as a
whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
which we are subject in international business is contained in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.” Nevertheless, in the
opinion of our management, these risks are offset by the
diversification of the international business and the protection
provided by letters of credit and advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
technological advances. Although successful product and systems
development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
financial resources, some of our competitors in each of our
businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness, product
quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service,
ability to meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of
dealers in international areas.

In the Government Communications Systems segment principal
competitors include: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics,
Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, L-3 Communications, ITT Industries,
Computer Sciences and SAIC. Consolidation among
U.S. defense and aerospace companies has resulted in a
reduction in the number of principal prime contractors. As a
result of this consolidation, we frequently “partner”
or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
programs.

In the RF Communications segment principal competitors include:
Thales, ITT Industries, General Dynamics, Raytheon,
Rohde & Schwarz, and Tadiran.

In the Microwave Communications segment principal competitors
include: Alcatel, Stratex Networks, Ericsson, NEC, Nera,
Siemens, Nokia and Fujitsu, as well as other smaller companies.
Several of our competitors are original equipment manufacturers
through which we sometimes distribute and sell products and
services to end-users.

In the Broadcast Communications segment principal competitors
include: Broadcast Electronics, Omnibus, NEC, Rohde &
Schwarz, Thompson, Thales, as well as other smaller companies
and divisions of large companies.

Principal Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only customer
accounting for 3 percent or more of our total revenue, were
66 percent, 66 percent and 62 percent of our
total revenue in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our
U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from
contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the
U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
terminable at the convenience of the U.S. Government, as
well as for default. Companies engaged in supplying goods and
services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
policies resulting from various military, political and
international developments. Long-term government contracts and
related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for
subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under
contracts terminable at the convenience of the
U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
and may require the contractor to pay



for the incremental cost of reprocurement and may hold the
contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also
uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for
design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and
schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated
technical work. Under many U.S. Government contracts, we
are required to maintain facility and personnel security
clearances complying with Department of Defense and other
Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of risks
relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Legal
Proceedings” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Backlog

Our funded backlog of unfilled orders was approximately
$1,141 million at July 29, 2005, $962 million at
July 30, 2004 and $891 million at July 25, 2003.
The determination of backlog involves substantial estimating,
particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and
long-term contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as the value of contract awards
received from the U.S. Government for which the
U.S. Government has appropriated funds and the
appropriating agency has given us authorization to spend these
funds under the contract, plus the amount of contract awards and
orders received from customers other than the
U.S. Government that have yet to be recognized as revenue.
We expect to fill in fiscal 2006 approximately 85 percent
of our funded backlog as of July 29, 2005. However, there
can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become revenue
in any particular period, if at all. Our funded backlog does not
include the full amount of our contract awards, including those
pertaining to multi-year, cost-reimbursable contracts, which are
generally funded on an annual basis. Funded backlog also
excludes the sales amount of unexercised contract options that
may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the
sales amount of purchase orders that may be issued under
indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements.
Backlog is subject to delivery delays and program cancellations,
which are beyond our control. Additional information with regard
to the backlog of each of our segments is provided under
“Description of Business by Segment.”

Research, Development and Engineering

Our businesses require substantial commitment of resources to
maintain significant positions in the markets we serve.
Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
approximately $870 million in fiscal 2005,
$841 million in fiscal 2004 and $600 million in fiscal
2003.

Company-sponsored research and product development costs, which
included research and development for commercial products and
independent research and development related to government
products and services, were approximately $137 million in
fiscal 2005, $111 million in fiscal 2004 and
$100 million in fiscal 2003. The portion of total research,
development and engineering expenditures not company-sponsored
was funded by U.S. Government and commercial customers and
is included in our revenue. Company-funded research is directed
to the development of new products and to building technological
capability in selected communications and electronic systems
markets. U.S. Government-funded research helps strengthen
and broaden our technical capabilities. Almost all of our
segments maintain their own engineering and new product
development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
advanced-technology departments. As of July 1, 2005 we
employed approximately 5,500 engineers and scientists and are
continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
our business segments available for all other business segments.

Patents and Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property rights,
in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a
large and valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets,
know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and
other intellectual property. We also license intellectual
property to and from third parties. As of July 1, 2005, we
held approximately 729 U.S. patents and 191 foreign
patents, and had approximately 364 U.S. patent applications
pending and 856 foreign patent applications pending. However, we
do not consider our business or any business segment to be
materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other
intellectual property right, or any group of related patents or
other intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a
proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a
number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which
generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements
have generated income in past years and may do so in the future,
there can be no assurances we will enter into additional
income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage
in litigation to protect our patents and intellectual property.
Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, and
other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. With
regard to patents relating to our Government Communications
Systems segment, the U.S. Government often has an
irrevocable,



non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the
U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the
inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar
arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of
inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous
trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also
considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations, in common with those of industry
in general, are subject to numerous domestic and international
laws and regulations designed to protect the environment,
particularly with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe
that we have complied with these requirements and that such
compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business
or financial condition. Based upon currently available
information, we do not expect expenditures to protect the
environment and to comply with current environmental laws and
regulations over the next several years to have a material
impact on our competitive or financial position. If future laws
and regulations contain more stringent requirements than
presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than
our present estimates of those expenditures. We have installed
waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to
satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization
and prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
environmental capital projects in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003. A
portion of our environmental expenditures relates to
discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
material in fiscal 2006. These amounts may increase in future
years. Additional information regarding environmental and
regulatory matters is set forth in “Legal Proceedings”
and in

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Radio communications are also subject to governmental
regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments, in particular, is subject
to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference
among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit
interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to
our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules
and regulations with respect to our future products.
Reallocation of frequency spectrum also could impact our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
of components and the ability of our suppliers and
subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications
and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
of a particular item or because of domestic preference
requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
materials or products.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be
seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
U.S. Government awards, the availability of funding,
product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

As of July 1, 2005, we employed approximately 12,600 people
compared with approximately 10,900 employees at the end of
fiscal 2004. The increase is mainly due to the acquisitions of
Orkand and Encoda. Approximately 11,600 employees are located in
the United States. As of July 1, 2005, approximately 8,000
employees were employed in the Government Communications Systems
segment, 1,500 in the RF Communications segment, 1,100 in the
Microwave Communications segment and 1,600 in the Broadcast
Communications segment, with the remainder employed in
headquarters or other support or service functions. We also
utilize a number of independent contractors. None of our
employees in the United States is represented by a labor union.
In certain international subsidiaries, our employees are
represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions.
In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are
good.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act as exhibits to this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In addition, an annual CEO certification was
submitted by our CEO to the New York Stock Exchange in 2004 in
accordance with the NYSE’s listing standards.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
in Melbourne, Florida. As of July 1, 2005, we operated
approximately 108 facilities in the United States, Canada,
Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
5.7 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
space, of which approximately 4.2 million square feet are
owned and approximately 1.5 million square feet are leased.
There are no major encumbrances on any of our facilities. Our
leased facilities are for the most part occupied under leases
for terms ranging from one month to 12 years, a majority of
which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than five-year
intervals at our option. As of July 1,



2005, the locations and approximate floor space of our principal
offices and facilities in productive use were as follows:



In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
not considered significant. We continuously review our
anticipated requirements for facilities and will, from time to
time, acquire additional facilities, expand existing facilities,
and dispose of existing facilities or parts thereof, as
management deems necessary. For more information about our lease
obligations, see

Note 19: Lease Commitments

in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our facilities and
other properties are generally maintained in good operating
condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal incident of the
nature and kind of businesses in which we are engaged, various
claims or charges are asserted and litigation commenced against
us arising from or related to: product liability; personal
injury; patents, trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee
disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
products containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or
environmental matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but
may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the
claim or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral
awards. We have recorded accruals for losses related to those
matters that we consider to be probable and that can be
reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized
when they are realized and legal costs are generally expensed
when incurred. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome
of these matters with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or
proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us,
based upon available information, in the opinion of management,
settlements and final judgments, if any, which are considered
probable of being rendered against us in litigation or
arbitration in existence at July 1, 2005 are reserved
against, covered by insurance or would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

U.S. Government Business.

U.S. Government
contractors, such as us, engaged in supplying goods and services
to the U.S. Government and its various agencies, depend on
Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
policies. U.S. Government contracts typically involve long
lead times for design and development, are subject to
significant changes in contract scheduling and may be
unilaterally modified or cancelled by the U.S. Government.
Often these contracts call for successful design and production
of complex and technologically advanced products or systems. We
may participate in supplying goods and services to the
U.S. Government as either a prime contractor or as a
subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes may arise between
the prime contractor and the U.S. Government and the prime
contractor and its subcontractors and may result in litigation
between the contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
U.S. Government, and specific acquisition regulations that
implement or supplement the FAR such as the Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulations. As a government contractor, our
contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by
the Defense Contract Audit Agency. In addition to these routine
audits, from time to time, we may, either individually or in
conjunction with other U.S. Government contractors, be the
subject of audits and investigations by other agencies of the
U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are
conducted to determine if our performance and administration of
our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable
contractual requirements, procurement and other applicable
Federal statutes and regulations. These investigations may be
conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict the
outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
against us, our officers or employees. Under present
U.S. Government procurement regulations, if indicted or
adjudged in violation of procurement or other Federal civil
laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating
divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines, penalties,
repayments, or compensatory or treble damages.
U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain
findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
debarment from eligibility for awards of new
U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. In
addition, a U.S. Government contractor’s export
privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension or
debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of
our reliance on U.S. Government contracts.

International.

As an international company, we are, from
time to time, the subject of investigations relating to our
international operations, including under the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.



Environmental.

We are subject to numerous Federal, state
and foreign environmental laws and regulatory requirements and
are involved from time to time in investigations or litigation
of various potential environmental issues concerning activities
at our facilities or former facilities or remediation as a
result of past activities. From time to time, we receive notices
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
equivalent state or foreign environmental agencies that we are a
potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly
known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent laws.
Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup costs at
various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites we
previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by
us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us
from past operations. We have been named as a potentially
responsible party at 13 such sites, excluding sites as to which
our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability
has been finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict
the outcome of many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our
management, any payments we may be required to make as a result
of such claims in existence at July 1, 2005 will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or our
business taken as a whole. Additional information regarding
environmental matters is set forth in

Note 1:
Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which Note is incorporated herein by
reference.

Other Matters.

On August 17, 1998, we filed a patent
infringement claim against Ericsson, Inc. (“Ericsson”)
in the U.S. Federal District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia and on November 5, 1998, the Court transferred
the case to the Northern District of Texas (“District
Court”). On October 29, 2002, a jury rendered a
verdict in our favor against Ericsson and its parent company.
The jury awarded us approximately $61 million in
compensatory damages and found that Ericsson’s conduct was
“willful.” Following the rendering of such verdict, we
filed a motion to enhance the damages based upon the finding of
willfulness, and Ericsson filed motions: (i) to decrease
the damage award, (ii) to order a new trial, and
(iii) for non-infringement and invalidity of the relevant
patent notwithstanding the jury’s verdict. On July 17,
2003, the District Court issued a ruling on these motions
denying Ericsson’s motions for non-infringement and
invalidity of the patent, but ruled that unless we agreed to a
lowered damage award of $43 million in compensatory
damages, it was granting Ericsson’s motion for a new trial
on the issue of damages. We agreed to the lowered damages and
thus, a judgment was entered for us in the amount of
$43 million plus $1 million for enhanced damages and
$1 million for attorneys’ fees, as well as
pre-judgment interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004,
Ericsson appealed the judgment of the District Court to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(“CAFC”). We filed a cross appeal seeking to increase
the amount of enhanced damages. The briefing for the appeal was
completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and oral
arguments were held during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. On
August 5, 2005, the CAFC issued an opinion vacating the
jury’s finding of infringement on one of the four patent
claims; vacating the District Court’s denial of post-trial
briefs by Ericsson; and remanding the case to the District Court
for further proceedings. A dissenting opinion was also
published. On August 19, 2005, we filed a petition for
reconsideration and, in the alternative, a petition for
rehearing by the CAFC. We anticipate a decision on these
petitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

On July 29, 2002, we received a demand letter from Bourdex
Telecommunications Limited (“Bourdex”), a
Nigerian-based customer for a product of our former analog base
station business and related services, alleging (i) breach
of contract, and (ii) deceit based upon misrepresentation.
In accordance with the contract, we submitted an arbitration
request pursuant to the International Chamber of Commerce’s
Procedural Rules asking for a determination that we fully
complied with the contract and that we owed no further duty to
Bourdex. In January 2003, Bourdex restated its demand at
$22.3 million. The arbitration hearing took place beginning
in March 2004 and concluded in July 2004. Based on that hearing,
the parties received a decision from the arbitration panel in
January 2005 indicating that we breached a duty to Bourdex,
based on a special relationship that developed between the
parties. According to the decision, other issues still need to
be considered, subject to further pleadings on the topic of
appropriate remedies, if any. After the January 2005 decision,
Bourdex continued to revise its demands. The current demand is
for approximately $35 million. A hearing on the issue of
remedies and damages is scheduled to be held during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. We intend to continue the vigorous
defense of this claim and consider appropriate appellate relief.
We believe that the potential losses related to this case range
from no liability to the amount of Bourdex’s demand and
accordingly we have not accrued any liability for this item as
of July 1, 2005.



ITEM 4.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted by us to a vote of our security
holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

The name, age, executive office, position held with us, and
principal occupation and employment during at least the past
5 years for each of our executive officers as of
August 27, 2005, are as follows:



There is no family relationship between any of our executive
officers or directors, and there are no arrangements or
understandings between any of our executive officers or
directors and any other person pursuant to which any of them was
appointed or elected as an officer or director, other than
arrangements or understandings with our directors or officers
acting solely in their capacities as such. All of our executive
officers are elected annually and serve at the pleasure of our
Board of Directors.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
    STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Market Information

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and
primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS.”
According to the records of our transfer agent, as of
August 19, 2005, there were approximately 7,445 holders of
record of our common stock. On February 25, 2005 our Board
of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common
stock. The stock split was effected in the form of a
100 percent stock dividend distributed on March 30,
2005 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2005. All share
and per share amounts and information presented in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively restated to
reflect the effect of this stock split for all periods
presented. The high and low sales prices of our common stock as
reported on the NYSE composite transactions reporting system and
the dividends paid on our common stock for each quarterly period
in our last two fiscal years are reported below:

On August 19, 2005, the last sale price of our common stock
as reported in the NYSE composite transactions reporting system
was $37.00 per share.



Dividends

The dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in our
last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
August 27, 2005 our Board of Directors increased our annual
dividend rate from $0.24 per share to $0.32 per share and
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which
will be paid on September 16, 2005 to holders of record on
September 7, 2005. Our annual common stock dividend rate,
on a post-stock split basis, was $0.24, $0.20, and
$0.16 per share in fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in
March, June, September and December. We have paid cash dividends
every year since 1941 and currently expect that cash dividends
will continue to be paid in the near future; however, there can
be no assurances that this will be the case. The declaration of
dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of
factors, including our financial condition, capital
requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities

During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 1,874,000 shares of our
common stock at an average price per share of $30.10. During
fiscal 2004, we repurchased 2,608,800 shares of our common
stock at an average price per share of $21.63. We currently
expect that we will repurchase shares of our common stock to
offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock
incentive plans. Additionally, if warranted, we will consider
accelerating our repurchases.

The following table sets forth information, on a post-stock
split basis, with respect to repurchases by us of our common
stock during the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005:

*

Periods represent our fiscal months.

(1)

On April 27, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved a share repurchase program that authorizes us to
    repurchase, on a post-stock split basis, up to 6 million
    shares through open-market transactions, or in negotiated block
    transactions. This program does not have an expiration date. The
    maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under our
    currently authorized repurchase program as of July 1, 2005
    is 4,566,000. All repurchases made in the quarter ended
    July 1, 2005 under this program were made in open-market
    transactions. As a matter of policy, we do not repurchase shares
    during the period beginning on the

th

day
    of the third month of a fiscal quarter and ending two days
    following the public release of earnings and financial results
    for such fiscal quarter.

(2)

Represents a combination of (a) shares of our common stock
    delivered to us in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax
    withholding obligation by holders of employee stock options who
    exercised stock options, (b) shares of our common stock
    delivered to us in satisfaction of the tax withholding
    obligation of holders of performance shares or restricted shares
    which vested during the quarter, (c) performance or
    restricted shares returned to us upon retirement or termination
    of employment, or (d) shares of our common stock purchased
    by the trustee of the Harris Corporation Master Rabbi Trust to
    fund obligations under our deferred compensation plans. Our
    equity incentive plans provide that the value of shares
    delivered to us to pay the exercise price of options or withheld
    to cover tax obligations shall be the closing price of our
    common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs.

BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
technology company focused on providing assured communications
products, systems and services for government and commercial
customers. Our four segments serve markets for government
communications, secure tactical radio, microwave and broadcast
systems. Our company generates revenue, income and cash flows by
developing, manufacturing and selling communications products
and software as well as providing related services. We generally
sell products and services directly to our customers, the
largest of which is the U.S. Government and its prime
contractors; however, we utilize agents and distributors to sell
some products and services, especially in international markets.

We operate in four business segments: (1) Government
Communications Systems, (2) RF Communications,
(3) Microwave Communications, and (4) Broadcast
Communications. Financial information with respect to all of our
other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
part of Headquarters Expense or Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
Corporation will be the best-in-class global provider of
mission-critical assured communications systems and services to
both government and commercial customers, combining advanced
technology and application knowledge to offer a superior value
proposition.”

tm

HD
    radio transmitter, and the next-generation H-Class software
    solution to replace legacy systems; and

•

Expand the localized regional strategy in international markets
    by utilizing service support teams to face customers locally.

Leveraging key corporate initiatives across business
segments and making strategic acquisitions:

One of our
strengths is our ability to transfer technology between segments
and focus our research and development projects in ways that
benefit Harris as a whole. Another area of focus is
cross-selling through division sales channels such as selling
our microwave network management software through our Broadcast
Communications and Government Communications Systems segments,
selling our Broadcast Communications segment’s portable
broadcast transmission equipment to the customers of our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications segments
and selling our Microwave Communications segment’s
microwave radios to our Broadcast Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments’ customers. Other corporate
initiatives include utilizing corporate-wide supply chain
programs and joint international market channel development such
as shared distributors and coordinated go-to-market strategies.

Strategies for continued profitable growth also include
effective capital allocation by following macro-economic market
and technology trends and by making effective acquisitions and
investments to build or complement the strengths in our base
businesses. Acquisitions could also serve to balance and enhance
our portfolio of businesses.

Continuing focus on lower costs:

Our principal
focus areas for cost management are to drive down procurement
costs with an emphasis on coordinated supply chain management,
to improve our manufacturing efficiencies across all segments,
to optimize our facility utilization and to dedicate engineering
resources to focus on continuous product cost reductions. The
recent development of our lower-cost
TRuepoint

tm

microwave radios and the proposed move of our European
manufacturing operations in our Broadcast Communications segment
to the U.S. are prime examples of how we continue to
implement cost-management initiatives.

Maintaining an efficient capital structure:

Our
capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital.
We believe our strong capital position, our access to key
financial markets, our ability to raise funds at low effective
cost and our overall low cost of borrowing provide a competitive
advantage. We had $377.6 million in cash as of July 1,
2005 and have experienced increased operating cash flows over
the last fiscal year. Our cash is not restricted and can be used
to invest in capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions,
repurchase our common stock or pay dividends to our shareholders.

Fiscal 2005 Financial Measure Highlights

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will:
(1) increase our income from continuing operations per
diluted share; (2) improve our gross profit margin;
(3) provide additional leverage over time through reduced
engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenue; and (4) optimize our cost of capital. The
measure of our success will be reflected in our results of
operations and liquidity and capital resources:

Results of Operations Highlights:

Income from
continuing operations; income from continuing operations per
diluted share; revenue; gross margin; and engineering, selling
and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue represent
key measurements of our value drivers:

•

Income from continuing operations increased 61 percent from
    $126 million in fiscal 2004 to $202 million in fiscal
    2005;

•

Income from continuing operations per diluted share increased
    59 percent from $0.92 in fiscal 2004 to $1.46 in fiscal
    2005;

•

Revenue increased 19 percent from $2.5 billion in
    fiscal 2004 to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2005;

•

Gross margin was 25.0 percent of revenue in fiscal 2004
    compared to 27.5 percent of revenue in fiscal 2005; and

•

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of revenue remained constant at 16.7 percent in both fiscal
    2004 and fiscal 2005.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” for more
information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights:

In
fiscal 2005, our net cash provided by operating activities was
$301 million, a 12 percent increase from fiscal 2004,
and we expect to generate from $275 to $300 million of net
cash from operating activities in fiscal 2006. We believe this
ability to generate significant cash flows to



reinvest in our businesses demonstrates one of Harris’
strengths. It enables us to utilize cash in ways that our
management believes provide the greatest value. Principal uses
of our cash flows in fiscal 2005 were:

•

Acquisitions: $427 million;

•

Capital expenditures: $75 million;

•

Share repurchases: $56 million; and

•

Dividends: $32 million or $0.24 per common share.

Refer to MD&A heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and
Financial Strategies” for more information.

Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Government and Defense Industry:

The markets for
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications continue
to be affected by the war on terror. The U.S. and its allies
have undertaken a move toward a more communications-centric and
more capabilities-based structure. This provides for a more
flexible response through greater force mobility, stronger space
capabilities, enhanced missile defense, greater intelligence
gathering, and improved information systems capabilities and
security. The requirement to upgrade and modernize
communications capabilities and provide more secure,
interoperable and reliable communications has moved to the
forefront of funding priorities. It has also focused greater
attention on the security of our homeland and better
communications interplay between law enforcement, civil
government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military
services.

The Future Years Defense Plan (“FYDP”) submitted with
the President’s budget request for government fiscal year
(“GFY”) 2006 projects a strong commitment to research
and development of transformational communications capabilities
across military services. The budget request for GFY 2006
includes $419.3 billion for overall defense spending. It
also proposes some reductions in funding for a number of
existing defense programs. In addition to the annual defense
budget process, on May 11, 2005, President Bush signed into
law legislation that provides $82 billion in supplemental
GFY 2005 funding, most of it to help cover the cost of
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The measure provided
$75.9 billion for the U.S. Department of Defense,
including funds for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi
Freedom. Significant funding in both the annual defense budget
and supplemental spending has been earmarked for force
modernization efforts that are driving strong demand for
tactical radio procurements. Modernization efforts by
international defense forces to provide secure, reliable, and
interoperable communications are also increasing tactical radio
demand.

The $419.3 billion U.S. Department of Defense GFY 2006
budget request is 4.8 percent above the
U.S. Department of Defense budget for its 2005 fiscal year,
excluding supplemental appropriations. While the
U.S. Department of Defense budget increase can be a
positive indicator of growth for the defense industry, we
believe that the level of growth and amount of budget ultimately
allocated to the U.S. Department of Defense procurement
(“Procurement”) along with research, development, test
and evaluation (“RDT&E”) components of the
U.S. Department of Defense budget, are a better indicator
of U.S. Department of Defense spending. These accounts are
applicable to defense contractors because they generally
represent the amounts that are expended for military hardware
and technology. The Procurement and RDT&E components of the
GFY 2006 budget request, which does not reflect any potential
supplemental funding, are essentially flat when compared to GFY
2005. For GFYs 2007 through 2009 the GFY 2006 budget request
includes a 6 to 8 percent annual increase in these accounts.

We are subject to U.S. Government oversight. Therefore, the
U.S. Government may investigate our business practices and
audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations.
Depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the
U.S. Government could make claims against us. Under
U.S. Government procurement regulations and practices, an
indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result
in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able
to bid on, or be awarded, new U.S. Government contracts for
a period of time. Similar government oversight exists in most
other countries where we conduct business. We are currently not
aware of any compliance audits or investigations that could
result in a significant impact to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

While recent developments in the government and defense industry
have had a positive impact on our Government Communications
Systems and RF Communications segments, we remain subject to
other risks associated with U.S. Government business,
including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual
appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and
other risks, which are discussed under Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings” and under “Forward-Looking Statements and
Factors that May Affect Future Results” in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.



Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications
Industry:

Global economic growth rates continue at
modest but stable levels in the microwave and broadcast
communications industries and are being primarily driven by the
following factors:

•

Accelerating demand for bandwidth continues, driven by the next
    wave of emerging technologies and applications (e.g., WiMax,
    mobile video and wireless data), wireless subscriber growth in
    developing countries, and continuing fixed-to-mobile
    substitution;

•

Market growth is expected for microwave products in Eastern
    Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, Central Africa and the
    Middle East;

•

In North America, mobile service providers continue to expand
    their cellular coverage and capacity in their cellular networks.
    Also, many domestic private network infrastructures are aging
    and require upgrades. Because of heightened awareness of public
    safety and interoperability issues, funding continues to be
    available for upgrades, including from the Department of
    Homeland Security;

•

Digital media content and programming continues to reshape the
    broadcast markets with transitions to new technologies such as
    digital TV, HD
    Radio

tm

,
    mobile television, and software systems to manage and distribute
    digital content;

•

Domestic radio broadcasters are taking steps to transition from
    analog to digital technology. There are approximately 14,000
    radio stations in the United States and 2,500 of these stations
    have committed to convert to digital technology over the next
    few years;

•

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has
    mandated a digital television roll out. Stations in the top one
    hundred markets had until July 2005 to comply with full-power
    DTV transmission requirements and all other markets will have
    until July 2006. Congress is considering legislation that will
    require the return of all analog frequencies from the
    broadcasters by January 1, 2009. The returned analog
    spectrum will be available for auction by the FCC for new
    commercial uses;

•

The international transition to digital technologies, for both
    radio and television, is in various stages of implementation.
    Consequently, many international markets remain primarily analog
    replacement markets;

•

Global consolidation continues in both the telecommunications
    and broadcast communications markets, creating larger players
    who need global partners; and

•

The demand for more end-to-end solutions and outsourcing
    continues to grow in the microwave and broadcast communications
    markets.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
well aligned with, and that we are poised to take advantage of,
the market trends noted above. While we believe that these
developments generally will have a positive impact on us, we
remain subject to general economic conditions that could
adversely affect our customers. We also remain subject to other
risks associated with these markets, including technological
uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s regulations for the
roll out of digital television, slow market adoption of digital
radio or any of our new products and other risks which are
discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors
that May Affect Future Results” in this Annual Report on

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our revenue
for fiscal 2005 was $3,000.6 million, an increase of
19.1 percent compared to fiscal 2004. Revenue increased in
our Government Communications Systems, RF Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments. Our Government Communications
Systems and Broadcast Communications segments’ revenue
increases included the impact of the Orkand and Encoda
acquisitions, respectively. Income from continuing operations
for fiscal 2005 was $202.2 million, or $1.46 per
diluted share, compared to $125.7 million, or
$0.92 per diluted share in fiscal 2004.



Operating income from all four of our segments improved in
fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004. Our RF Communications
and Government Communications Systems segments led this
improvement with 40.0 percent and 32.6 percent
increases, respectively. Our Microwave Communications segment
generated operating income of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005
compared to an operating loss of $12.1 million in fiscal
2004. Our Broadcast Communications segment’s operating
income increased to $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared
with $8.1 million in fiscal 2004 and its results for fiscal
2005 reflect the contribution from the Encoda acquisition, which
included a $4.8 million impairment of capitalized software
and a $3.8 million write-off of in-process research and
development. These improvements in income were offset by an
increase in headquarters expense and corporate eliminations in
fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we had
a non-operating loss of $6.3 million compared to a
non-operating loss of $11.0 million in fiscal 2004. See the
“Discussion of Business Segments” section of this
MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our revenue
for fiscal 2004 was $2,518.6 million, an increase of
22.2 percent compared to fiscal 2003. Increased revenue in
our Government Communications Systems, RF Communications and
Microwave Communications segments were partially offset by
decreased revenue in our Broadcast Communications segment.
Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was
$125.7 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared to
$70.3 million, or $.53 per diluted share in fiscal
2003.

The increase in income from continuing operations resulted
primarily from increased operating income in our Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments in fiscal
2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. Our Microwave Communications
segment also experienced lower operating losses in fiscal 2004
when compared to fiscal 2003, and our corporate headquarters
expense and eliminations were lower in fiscal 2004 at
$59.0 million compared to $69.6 million in fiscal
2003. In fiscal 2004, we had a non-operating loss of
$11.0 million compared to $23.7 million of
non-operating income in fiscal 2003.

Our two government businesses continued to deliver strong
revenue growth and strong operating performance. The Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments benefited
from a diverse customer base and broad portfolio of tactical and
strategic programs that supported the U.S. Government and
international customers. Income from continuing operations was
impacted by $8.0 million of after-tax charges associated
with cost-reduction actions aimed at reducing expenses in our
Microwave Communications and Broadcast Communications segments
in fiscal 2004. See the “Discussion of Business
Segments” section of this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our gross
margin (revenue less cost of product sales and services) as a
percentage of revenue was 27.5 percent in fiscal 2005
compared to 25.0 percent in fiscal 2004. Gross margin as a
percent of revenue increased across all segments. The increase
in gross margin in fiscal 2005 was significantly enhanced by
additional software sales as a result of our acquisition of
Encoda and margin leverage associated with higher sales volume
in our RF Communications segment. These improvements in gross
margin were partially offset by a $4.8 million write-off
related to the impairment of capitalized software development
costs associated with our acquisition of Encoda and a larger mix
of sales from our Government Communications segment, which
carries a lower gross margin than our other three business
segments due to the high level of cost-reimbursable programs it
performs for the U.S. Government. See the “Discussion
of Business Segments” section of this MD&A for further
information.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our gross
margin as a percentage of revenue was 25.0 percent in
fiscal 2004 compared to 25.1 percent in fiscal 2003. Fiscal
2003 gross margin was impacted by $8.6 million of inventory
write-offs associated with the exit from our Microwave
Communications segment’s WinRoLL and RapidNet wireless
local loop products ($5.8 million) and MDL microwave radio
products ($1.3 million) and the shut-down of our
manufacturing plant in Brazil ($1.5 million).



Gross margins as a percentage of revenue improved in our RF
Communications, Microwave Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments in fiscal 2004 when compared to
fiscal 2003. The gross margin improvements as a percentage of
revenue in these three segments were offset by a larger mix of
sales from our Government Communications Systems segment which
carries a lower gross margin than our RF Communications segment
and our two commercial segments due to the high level of
cost-reimbursable programs it performs for the
U.S. Government. Also, the Broadcast Communications segment
experienced lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. See the
“Discussion of Business Segments” section of this

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased from
$421.0 million in fiscal 2004 to $502.6 million in
fiscal 2005. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses were
flat at 16.7 percent. The increase in our engineering,
selling, and administrative expenses is primarily related to our
acquisition of Encoda. This business typically has higher
engineering, selling and administrative expenses than other
Harris businesses. Fiscal 2005 engineering, selling and
administrative expenses include a $3.8 million write-off of
in-process research and development related to our acquisition
of Encoda. Additionally, our Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments had higher research and
development costs in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004.
The rate of increase in the Government Communications Systems
and RF Communications segments’ revenue, however, outpaced
the rate of increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses. Corporate eliminations and headquarters expense, which
are included in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses, also increased by $9.2 million and
$6.3 million, respectively. See the “Discussion of
Business Segments” section of this MD&A for further
information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
administrative expenses, were $137.3 million in fiscal
2005, compared to $111.3 million in fiscal 2004. The
increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of
spending on the development of our Falcon® III radio
in the RF Communications segment and an increased level of
independent research and development projects and bids and
proposals in our Government Communications Systems segment.

Customer-sponsored research and development, which does not
impact engineering, selling and administrative expenses, was
$733.0 million in fiscal 2005 compared to
$729.9 million in fiscal 2004. Customer-sponsored research
and development is included in our revenue and cost of product
sales and services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our
engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased from
$414.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $421.0 million in
fiscal 2004. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses
decreased from 20.1 percent in fiscal 2003 to
16.7 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in revenue
outpaced the increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses primarily due to the impact of cost-reduction actions
taken in fiscal 2003 at our corporate headquarters and separate
cost-reduction actions taken in our Microwave Communications and
Broadcast Communications segments.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were impacted
by expenses associated with cost-reduction actions of
$7.3 million and $4.4 million in our Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments,
respectively, in fiscal 2004 and $8.3 million and
$4.4 million in our Microwave Communications and Broadcast
Communications segments, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Fiscal
2004 engineering, selling and administrative expenses were also
impacted by a $4.0 million reversal of a previously
established reserve for the consolidation of our Broadcast
Communications segment’s European operations.

Headquarters expense, which is included in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses, decreased in fiscal 2004 when
compared to fiscal 2003 due mostly to $12.4 million of
write-downs in fiscal 2003 related to the disposal of assets
remaining from our previously exited telephone switch business
and expenses associated with fiscal 2003 cost-reduction actions
of $4.0 million.

Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
our Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments to support significant growth in these businesses and
included a higher level



of selling and marketing and research and development
activities. The rate of increase in revenue in these segments,
however, exceeded the rate of increase in engineering, selling
and administrative expenses. See the “Discussion of
Business Segments” section of this MD&A for further
information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
administrative expenses, were $111.3 million in fiscal
2004, compared to $99.8 million in fiscal 2003. The
increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of
spending on the development of our Falcon® III radio
in the RF Communications segment and an increased level of
independent research and development projects and bids and
proposals in our Government Communications Systems segment.

Customer-sponsored research and development, which does not
impact engineering, selling and administrative expenses,
increased from $499.9 million in fiscal 2003 to
$729.9 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the
U.S. Government’s increased spending on research and
development projects. Customer-sponsored research and
development is included in our revenue and cost of product sales
and services.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Our
non-operating loss was $6.3 million for fiscal 2005,
compared to a non-operating loss of $11.0 million in fiscal
2004. The decrease in non-operating loss was primarily due to an
$8.5 million gain in fiscal 2005 from our execution of a
patent cross-licensing agreement. See

Note 21:
Non-Operating Income (Loss)

in the Notes for further
information.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

In fiscal
2004, the non-operating loss was $11.0 million compared to
$23.7 million of non-operating income in fiscal 2003. Most
of the change between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was due to a
decrease in gains from the sale of securities available-for-sale
from $21.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $2.3 million in
fiscal 2004 as well as an $18.8 million gain from the sale
of our minority interest in our LiveTV, LLC joint venture in
fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 non-operating loss also included a
$5.0 million write-down of our interest in Teltronics, Inc.
related to impairment of this investment that was other than
temporary and an $8.5 million pre-tax loss and a
$6.4 million pre-tax gain in two unrelated patent
infringement cases. Fiscal 2004 non-operating loss included
$1.9 million of investment impairments compared to
$9.1 million in fiscal 2003. Expenses and fees associated
with selected investments were $0.6 million in fiscal 2004
and $5.1 million in fiscal 2003.

earned on our cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by
lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of Encoda
and Orkand. Our interest expense decreased from
$24.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $24.0 million in
fiscal 2005 due to lower short-term debt balances.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from
continuing operations before income taxes was 32.2 percent
in fiscal 2005 and 30.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The
increase in the rate is primarily due to the settlement of a
foreign tax audit in fiscal 2004 that resulted in an income tax
benefit of $3.3 million. The fiscal 2005 rate, however, was
also affected by a $3.5 million reduction in taxes from the
resolution of certain tax issues for which liabilities had
previously been established, as well as a $3.8 million
non-deductible write-off of in-process research and development
related to our Encoda acquisition. The remaining increase in the
rate was mainly driven by the increase in our earnings and the
fixed nature of tax credits and other benefits we received in
both years related to export sales and the use of state, local
and foreign income tax loss carryforwards.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre-tax income was
30.2 percent in fiscal 2004 and 35.0 percent in fiscal
2003. The decrease in the rate in fiscal 2004 is primarily due
to the settlement of a foreign tax audit that resulted in an
income tax benefit of $3.3 million. The fiscal 2004 rate
also includes a larger benefit from the use of state, local and
foreign income tax loss carryforwards. In both fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003, the impact of export sales reduced our total tax
rate below the statutory rate, including state income taxes.
Fiscal 2003 benefited from research and development tax credits.
The mix of foreign tax rates and sources of foreign income and
losses increased our tax rates in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Government
Communications Systems segment revenue increased
19.9 percent and operating income increased
32.6 percent from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Revenue
growth was attributable to both the acquisition of Orkand and
organic revenue growth, which was driven by the FTI program, the
Patriot technical services program for the NRO, and the IMN
program. Other programs contributing to revenue growth included
the AEHF, F/ A-18 E/ F Super Hornet, MIDS, ACS and MAF/TIGER
programs.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
improved during fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 due to
the revenue growth discussed above and excellent program
execution. Government Communications Systems operating income
also benefited from the final settlement of fiscal 2001 and an
anticipated settlement of fiscal 2002 government overhead rates,
which totaled $10.7 million. This benefit resulted from a
more favorable outcome than what we previously estimated and
reflected in our reserve position. Engineering, selling and
administrative expenses increased in our Government
Communications Systems segment in fiscal 2005 when compared to
fiscal 2004 due to additional research and development, the
acquisition of Orkand and headcount increases in administrative
positions needed to support this segment’s growth in
revenue. The rate of increase in revenue, however, exceeded the
rate of increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses.



The following highlights occurred during fiscal 2005 in our
Government Communications Systems segment:

•

We acquired Orkand, a privately-held provider of technical
    services and information technology for U.S. Government
    agencies, including the Department of State, Department of
    Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Health and
    Human Services, Department of Energy and the U.S. Postal
    Service. The amount of consideration to the former shareholders
    and option holders of Orkand was $67.3 million and was paid
    out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The Orkand
    acquisition resulted in goodwill of $49.7 million and
    identifiable intangible assets of $9.2 million. The
    identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods of 10 and 5 years. Orkand
    sales for the 12 months ended June 2004 were approximately
    $84 million. For further information, see

Note 4:
    Business Combinations

in the Notes.

•

We were selected by the NRO for a potential $1 billion,
    10-year contract (Patriot program) to provide operations,
    maintenance and support services for the agency’s global
    communications and information systems.

•

We were awarded contracts on two next-generation aerial
    surveillance platforms — the Battle Management Command
    and Control portion for the U.S. Air Force E-10A aircraft,
    and the U.S. Army’s ACS aircraft. As part of the ACS
    program, we were awarded a $75 million, three-year,
    communications integration contract with a potential value of
    $500 million over 20 years.

•

We were awarded a $275 million contract by the FAA to add
    mission support services to the FTI program scope. Total
    estimated value of the FTI program for us is now
    $2.2 billion through 2017.

•

We were awarded a contract with a potential value of
    $175 million over nine years from the Defense Information
    Systems Agency in support of its Crisis Management System.

•

We were awarded a contract with a potential value of
    $350 million over 10 years with the U.S. Navy to
    provide tactical common data links for helicopter-to-ship
    communications.

•

We were also awarded several major classified programs during
    fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Government
Communications Systems segment revenue increased
32.4 percent, and operating income increased
46.2 percent, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. Revenue
growth was all organic and was evident in each of this
segment’s primary U.S. Government customer groups.
Gross margins improved in this segment as a result of
outstanding performance on defense, intelligence, civil and
technical service programs; higher award fees, including a
seldom-awarded incentive fee on a classified program for
excellent schedule performance in the third quarter of fiscal
2004; and a successful contract resolution in the second quarter
of fiscal 2004. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our Government Communications Systems segment to
support the significant growth in revenue, which drove a higher
level of selling and marketing and research and development
activities. In this segment, however, the increase in revenue
exceeded the increase in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses.

Classified programs and previously awarded non-classified
contracts contributed to fiscal 2004 growth, including the JSF
program for the U.S. Air Force, the FTI program for the
FAA, the MAF/ TIGER database modernization program for the
U.S. Census Bureau and the MCOM program for the
U.S. Air Force. Wins also contributing to the growth in
fiscal 2004 included the IMN program, avionics on the F/ A-18 E/
F Super Hornet aircraft for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps,
the FAB-T program for the U.S. Air Force and the AEHF
program for the U.S. Navy.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

RF
Communications segment revenue increased 24.8 percent and
operating income increased 40.0 percent from fiscal 2004 to
fiscal 2005. Domestic revenue drivers included deliveries for
both multiband and HF Falcon® II radios to support the
U.S. Army Modularity initiative, Army Reserve, National
Guard and Marine Corps. International revenue benefited from the
continuing ramp up of the Bowman Tactical Radio Programme for
the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the initial deliveries of
Falcon® II radios



to Pakistan under a $68 million contract awarded in fiscal
2005 and other deliveries within the international market.

The operating income improvement in our RF Communications
segment was driven by improved gross margin on higher sales
volume and cost savings from successful negotiations with
contract manufacturers on the UK Bowman Tactical Radio
Programme. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses
increased in our RF Communications segment during fiscal 2005
when compared to fiscal 2004 due to additional research and
development costs associated with the development of our
Falcon® III products and expenses needed to sustain
the growth in this segment’s revenue. The rate of increase
in revenue, however, exceeded the rate of increase in
engineering, selling and administrative expenses.

Orders during the year were significantly greater than sales.
Tactical radio demand from U.S. Department of Defense
customers continued to be strong. Force modernization efforts
gained increased momentum and funding. This initiative delivers
enhanced command, control and communications to more and smaller
operating units. Significant domestic orders secured during
fiscal 2005 include:

•

Two contracts awarded from the U.S. Army to provide our
    Falcon® II HF and multiband radios and related
    services for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for the
    U.S. Army’s Modularity program. Each contract was
    worth approximately $30 million.

•

An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract awarded from
    the U.S. Marine Corps for HF radios valued at up to
    $75 million.

•

A $33 million order from the U.S. Army for HF radios,
    which included $16 million in support of
    Army Modularity.

•

A $50 million order for high-frequency radios and a
    $22 million order for multiband radios to support the
    U.S. Army Modularity Initiative, Army Reserve and National
    Guard.

•

A $55 million contract to a Boeing-led team, which includes
    our RF Communications segment, for the Airborne, Maritime/
    Fixed-Station cluster of the JTRS program for the
    U.S. Department of Defense.

Demand in international markets also remained strong as the need
for communications that are secure, interoperable and reliable
has grown. International orders were received from NATO members
and other countries, including a $68 million order from
Pakistan and large orders from Algeria, Philippines, Ethiopia,
Republic of Georgia, Denmark, Estonia, Sweden, Azerbaijan, and
Netherlands.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

RF
Communications segment revenue increased 32.1 percent and
operating income increased 41.0 percent from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004. This segment had exceptional growth due to strong
demand for the Falcon® II secure tactical radio from
both U.S. and international defense forces. Domestically, the
upgrade of tactical radio equipment was accelerated by
continuing troop deployments overseas. Increased demand
internationally was driven by efforts to combat terrorism and
increase national security around the world, communications
technology standardization programs in the Partnership for Peace
countries and requirements from coalition forces deployed in
both Iraq and Afghanistan. Revenue growth in the RF
Communications segment was also driven by our successful
participation in two long-term advanced radio development
contracts — the Bowman program for the U.K. Ministry
of Defence and the JTRS program for the U.S. Department of
Defense.

Operating margins increased in this segment in fiscal 2004 when
compared to fiscal 2003 as a result of improved manufacturing
efficiencies related to increased tactical product sales and
program execution largely driven by Bowman. Engineering, selling
and administrative expenses increased in the RF Communications
segment to support significant revenue growth and included a
higher level of selling and marketing and increased spending on
the development of our Falcon® III radio. The
Falcon® III is being developed for
U.S. Government customers and incorporates JTRS technology
and waveforms. It also will be compatible with radios currently
in the field. The increase in revenue, however, outpaced the
increase in engineering, selling and
administrative expenses.

The interoperability of the Falcon® family of radios became
increasingly important as countries sought communications
superiority for joint missions. Fiscal 2004 orders included
contracts to provide tactical radios for forces deployed to Iraq
and Afghanistan. International orders were received from NATO
members and other countries, including Albania, Kuwait, Norway,
Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Philippines,
Tunisia, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Microwave
Communications segment revenue decreased 2.9 percent from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The segment improved from an
operating loss of $12.1 million in fiscal 2004 to operating
income of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005. North American sales
remained strong. Strength in international markets came from the
Middle East, Africa, Europe and improving Latin American
markets. The slight decline in revenue is primarily attributable
to the revenue generated in fiscal 2004 from the build out of a
large mobile telecom network for MTN Nigeria, which was only
partially offset by an increase in North American revenue and
new international contracts won during fiscal 2005.

Gross margins in the Microwave Communications segment improved
in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased shipments of
TRuepoint

tm

,
a new family of lower-cost microwave radios, and a shift away
from lower-margin international projects. Engineering, selling
and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal 2005 when
compared to fiscal 2004 due to cost-reduction actions taken
during fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2004 operating loss of
$12.1 million includes a charge of $7.3 million
associated with cost-reduction actions related to the successful
transfer of
TRuepoint

tm

production from Montreal, Canada to San Antonio, Texas as
well as the consolidation of administrative and support
functions at this segment’s Durham, North Carolina
location.
TRuepoint

tm

orders and sales accelerated during fiscal 2005.
TRuepoint

tm

orders were significantly greater than sales of $45 million
for fiscal 2005, which exceeded our goal of $30 million in
sales of
TRuepoint

tm

for the year.

Significant orders during the year included an on-going network
project for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a major order
with a large defense contractor in support of an international
communications project, and various private network and mobile
telecommunications providers in North America. In addition to
North America, major new international orders included Vee
Networks Limited in Nigeria, MTN Nigeria, Nextel Brazil and
Mexico, Loteny Telecom in the Ivory Coast, Umniah Mobile Company
in Jordan, and PT Alvarid in Indonesia. We expanded our customer
base in the Middle East and Africa and received orders from
several new channel partners, including IRTE in Italy and ZTE
and Huawei in China, which has served to expand our
international presence. During fiscal 2005 we also signed a
long-term preferred supplier agreement with Sprint to provide
TRuepoint

tm

radios for its nationwide mobile services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Microwave
Communications segment revenue increased 10.9 percent from
fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. The segment’s operating loss
decreased from $24.3 million in fiscal 2003 to
$12.1 million in fiscal 2004. As a result of the sale of
our TTS business, the NetBoss® network operations software
business, which was part of the Network Support segment, was
consolidated into the Microwave Communications segment. North
American sales remained strong. After recent declines, revenue
increased in international markets. The revenue growth
internationally was driven by growth in the Middle East and
Africa as this segment solidified its position in this emerging
market. This included a project with MTN Nigeria, one of the
largest cellular network operations in Africa, to supply, design
and implement Harris MegaStar® radios for its high-capacity
GSM network. In fiscal 2004, the Microwave Communications
segment received contracts valued at $56 million from MTN
Nigeria.

The fiscal 2004 operating loss was impacted by $7.3 million
of expenses related to cost-reduction actions. The actions
include a net workforce reduction of 98 positions worldwide and
the transfer of 110 jobs related to administration and support
functions from Redwood Shores, California to lower-cost
operations in Durham, North Carolina. The segment also
established production and support for the new
TRuepoint

tm

microwave radio family at its San Antonio, Texas facility,
where the successful Constellation® and MegaStar®
product lines are manufactured.

The segment’s fiscal 2003 operating loss was impacted by
$16.9 million of inventory write-offs and cost-reduction
actions associated with the exit from its WinRoLL and RapidNet
wireless local loop products ($5.8 million), the exit from
its MDL microwave radio products ($1.3 million), the
shut-down of its Brazilian manufacturing plant
($1.5 million), and the consolidation of its research and
development activities in the



U.S. from three locations to one location in Durham, North
Carolina and the reduction of infrastructure costs in some of
its international locations ($8.3 million).

Microwave Communications segment’s gross margins improved
in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due to the
write-downs mentioned above, as well as cost reductions and
efficiencies gained in the production of its Constellation®
radios sold in the North American market. This segment’s
engineering, selling and administrative expenses decreased in
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due to the impact of
expenses related to the cost-reduction actions and the savings
realized from the actions taken in fiscal 2003.

Harris introduced
TRuepoint

tm

,
its next-generation microwave radio platform, in fiscal 2004.
The
TRuepoint

tm

product family will eventually cover operating frequencies from
6 to 38 GHz, with capacity scalable from 4 to 180
Mbits/sec.
TRuepoint

tm

supports multiple communications interfaces, including Internet
Protocol, which allows for maximum operator flexibility. In
addition,
TRuepoint

tm

production costs are significantly lower than production costs
for its predecessor radio family. Product shipments began in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

During fiscal 2004 Harris also continued to expand its
NetBoss® network operation software platform with the
release of an Element Manager version of the software.
NetBoss® was selected in fiscal 2004 by several large
international network operators, including MTC-Vodafone in
Kuwait and Telecom Americas and Claro, two of the largest mobile
operators in Brazil.

The $7.3 million of expenses related to cost-reduction
actions taken in fiscal 2004 included severance, relocation and
facility shutdown costs of $5.2 million, $0.9 million
and $1.2 million, respectively. The severance costs in
fiscal 2004 resulted from the layoff of 208 employees from the
following functions: manufacturing — 98; management
and administration — 39; sales and
marketing — 38; engineering — 22; and
services — 11. Geographically, the individuals were
from our locations in: Montreal, Canada — 120; Redwood
Shores, California — 74; Latin America — 8;
and other — 6. All of these individuals were notified
of their employment status and the terms of their severance
benefits prior to July 2, 2004, and they received severance
benefits prior to August 31, 2004.

The facility shut-down costs in fiscal 2004 of $1.2 million
related to vacating a portion of our facilities in Redwood
Shores, California ($1.0 million) and vacating our facility
in Bellevue, Washington ($0.2 million) and included the
write-off of assets such as leasehold improvements
($0.5 million) and lease termination costs
($0.7 million). These facilities were vacated prior to
July 2, 2004.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Broadcast
Communications segment revenue increased 33.7 percent from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The segment also had operating
income of $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared to
$8.1 million in fiscal 2004.

Encoda, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2005,
made significant contributions to segment revenue. Revenue
drivers also included increased sales in the U.S. of HD
Radio

tm

transmission equipment. The roll out of HD
Radio

tm

continues to gain momentum with 2,500 radio stations committed
to begin their digital broadcasts during the next four years.
U.S. digital television (“HDTV”) transmission
equipment sales increased in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal
2004 as broadcasters moved to meet FCC deadlines for full-power
transmission digital signals. This segment also experienced a
growing demand for its Intraplex products on our FTI program
with the FAA to carry high volumes of real-time,
mission-critical data. Revenue growth was dampened, however, by
weakness in international market conditions for both analog and
European-standard digital broadcasting equipment and for legacy
automation systems as we transition customers to our new
H-Class

tm

enterprise software system.

Operating income increased from $8.1 million in fiscal 2004
to $18.1 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in operating
income in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily
due to the acquisition of Encoda.



Encoda sells software solution products and services that carry
higher gross margins than most of this segment’s other
products and services. Engineering, selling and administrative
expenses increased significantly, which is also primarily due to
the Encoda acquisition. Encoda’s products and services
require a higher investment in research and development than
most of our other products in this segment. Research and
development costs in this segment were also higher because we
continue to invest in new product development. During fiscal
2005 we introduced the first module in our next-generation
H-Class broadcast enterprise software systems solutions. We also
introduced the new
PowerCD

tm

UHF digital transmitter that allows broadcasters to transition
quickly to HDTV while reducing energy costs. We also developed
transmission equipment for use in mobile video broadcasting
trials in the U.S., U.K., Australia and China and we continue to
invest in our second-generation
FLEXSTAR

tm

HD radio transmission product line.

The fiscal 2005 segment operating income of $18.1 million
also includes $8.6 million of acquisition-related costs
including a $4.8 million impairment of capitalized software
costs related to a software product that is sold by our
Broadcast Communications segment and is being displaced by a
product offered by Encoda and a $3.8 million write-off of
in-process research and development.

The following highlights occurred during fiscal 2005 in our
Broadcast Communications segment:

•

We acquired Encoda, a global supplier of software solutions and
    services for the broadcast media industry, including television,
    radio, cable, satellite and advertising agency customers.
    Encoda’s end-to-end workflow solutions include traffic and
    billing and program-scheduling systems, and automation and media
    asset management solutions that are complementary to our
    existing automation business. The amount of cash consideration
    paid to the former shareholders and option holders of Encoda and
    debt repaid at closing, including the impact of post-closing
    adjustments, totaled $355.1 million and was paid out of
    interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The purchase price
    allocation from the Encoda acquisition resulted in goodwill of
    $291.2 million and identifiable intangible assets of
    $91.0 million. The identifiable intangible assets are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over periods between 7 and
    10 years. Encoda sales for the 12 months ended
    September 2004 were approximately $128 million. For further
    information, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the Notes.

•

Significant domestic digital TV equipment orders were received
    from Gray Communications, Entravision Communications, Belo
    Corporation, Quincy Newspapers Networks, the Tri-State Christian
    Network, and Liberty Corporation as well as international orders
    from TV Azteca in Mexico, and other customers in Australia,
    Bulgaria and China.

•

Numerous HD
    Radio

tm

transmission orders were booked for National Public Radio, Cox
    Communications and Clear Channel Communications, among others.

•

We also received a large order from British Sky Broadcasting
    (“BSkyB”) for our software systems products. BSkyB
    will use the software as part of its forthcoming high-definition
    television services.

•

We were awarded a contract to provide FM radio transmission
    systems and equipment to the International Broadcasting Bureau.

•

We also received major orders from Turner Broadcasting and Sony
    Corporation for our software systems products.

To address the international market weakness, and to further
improve profitability, we plan to implement a series of
cost-reduction actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2006:

•

European-standard transmitter production will be moved from the
    Huntingdon, U.K. facility to the segment’s Quincy, Illinois
    facility, creating a single global transmitter manufacturing
    operation for both U.S. and European-standard products;

•

Radio console assembly and related products will be moved from
    the Mason, Ohio, facility to an outside supplier; and

•

New synergies arising from the Encoda acquisition have been
    identified, allowing for the elimination of staffing
    duplications.

In total these actions could result in the elimination of 150 to
200 positions within the Broadcast Communications segment and
the costs associated with these actions could total
approximately $27 million.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Broadcast
Communications segment revenue decreased 8.9 percent from
fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, and operating income increased from
$8.0 million in fiscal 2003 to $8.1 million in fiscal
2004. HDTV revenue declined from fiscal 2003, as
U.S. station owners continued to delay their next round of
investment while awaiting an FCC mandate for full HDTV
conversion. Analog radio shipments were also lower as the major
infrastructure project in Romania neared completion. Studio
products



and systems revenue increased in fiscal 2004, principally as a
result of the Broadcast Communications segment’s
participation in the IMN program with the Government
Communications Systems segment.

Fiscal 2004 operating income includes $4.4 million of costs
associated with cost-reduction actions, which included the
layoff of 81 employees in the U.S. and Europe. The
segment’s fiscal 2004 operating income also included a
$4 million reversal of a previously established reserve for
the consolidation of this segment’s European operations. In
addition to cost-reduction actions, we also realigned this
segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 into five
market-focused, customer-facing business units to drive revenue
growth and improve customer responsiveness. Fiscal 2003
operating income also included a $4.4 million charge
associated with cost-reduction actions aimed at reducing
infrastructure costs. Fiscal 2004 operating income was also
negatively impacted by poor manufacturing productivity
associated with the implementation of a new segment-wide IT
enterprise system and the relocation of European manufacturing
from Rankweil, Austria to Huntingdon, U.K.

Digital radio, also known as HD
Radio

tm

,
continued to gain momentum in the U.S. market. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we received an order from the
largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., Clear Channel
Communications, for 17 HD
Radio

tm

transmitters. Clear Channel also announced that over the next
three years it will roll out digital broadcasting equipment to
1,000 of its radio stations.

During 2004 we released additional modules for the Harris
Resource
Suite

tm

,
a powerful workflow management software tool that extends the
benefits of Master Control automation across the entire
ingest-to-broadcast process. The modules released were:
Broadcast Presentation Manager, which allows the management of
networks from both local and remote locations; Media Asset
Management, which has the capability to segment, index and
distribute digital content for future playback; and Digital
Ingest 1.1, which automates the front-end media ingest and
transfer process. Each of these solutions is focused on
improving productivity for our broadcast customers.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Broadcast
Communications segment decided to exit its unprofitable TV
systems integration business, which contributed approximately
$13 million in revenue in fiscal 2004.

The $4.4 million of expenses related to cost-reduction
actions taken in fiscal 2004 all related to severance costs. The
severance costs resulted from the layoff of 81 employees from
the following functions: management and
administration — 24; engineering — 23; sales
and marketing — 22; and manufacturing — 12.
Geographically, the individuals were from our locations in:
France — 27; Mason, Ohio — 27;
Austria — 15; Quincy, Illinois — 5;
Sunnyvale, California — 3; and other — 4.
All of these individuals were notified of their employment
status prior to July 2, 2004, and received severance
benefits prior to August 31, 2004.

Fiscal 2005 Compared With Fiscal 2004:

Headquarters expense increased 12.2 percent from
$51.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $58.0 million in
fiscal 2005. The increase in headquarters expense was primarily
due to higher compensation expense related to stock-based
compensation as a result of the increased price for Harris stock
as well as additional costs associated with the implementation
of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 and initiatives related
to supply chain management, strategic acquisitions and
technology transfers. Corporate eliminations increased
126.0 percent from $7.3 million in fiscal 2004 to
$16.5 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of revenue,
headquarters expense decreased from 2.1 percent in fiscal
2004 to 1.9 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase in
corporate eliminations was due to an increase in intersegment
sales between our Broadcast Communications and Government
Communications Systems segments related to our FTI program.

Fiscal 2004 Compared With Fiscal 2003:

Headquarters expense decreased 25.7 percent from
$69.6 million in fiscal 2003 to $51.7 million in
fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 headquarters expense included severance
costs associated with cost-reduction actions aimed at reducing
infrastructure costs ($4.0 million) and write-downs related
to the disposal of assets remaining from our previously exited
telephone switch business ($12.4 million). Fiscal 2003
headquarters expense also included a $4.2 million
contribution to our retiring Chief Executive Officer’s
supplemental executive retirement plan account.



In fiscal 2003, intersegment sales were transferred at prices
comparable to those provided to unaffiliated customers. In
fiscal 2004, intersegment sales were transferred at cost to the
buying segment and the sourcing segment recognized a normal
profit that was eliminated in the “corporate
eliminations” line item in our segment reporting set forth
in

Note 23: Business Segments

in the Notes. This
change in the intersegment policy resulted in an elimination of
intercompany profit, which was $7.3 million in fiscal 2004.

In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the Encoda acquisition, we allocated
$3.8 million of the purchase price to an in-process
research and development project. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete product. At the date of acquisition, the
development of this project had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the second quarter of fiscal
2005 and are included in engineering, selling and administrative
expenses.

In making this purchase price allocation we relied on present
value calculations of income, an analysis of project
accomplishments and completion costs and an assessment of
overall contribution and project risk. The amounts assigned to
the in-process research and development were associated with one
research project for which technological feasibility had not
been established. This project was for the development of a
next-generation product line, that is expected to encompass some
of the latest research applicable to media technologies such as
emergence and learning theory.

The value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
the purchased in-process research and development into
commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value using a discount rate of 25 percent.
As of the valuation date, the project was considered to be
approximately 30 to 40 percent complete and had remaining
costs until completion of approximately $6.2 million.

Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we completed the sale of
our TTS product line to a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation for
$43.1 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. The gain on the sale that has been recorded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $18.9 million pre-tax and
$9.1 million after-tax. This transaction, along with the
results of the TTS product line, has been reported as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented. Revenue from
the TTS product line was $40.3 million and
$32.1 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
product line also had pre-tax operating losses of
$3.5 million and $18.1 million in fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively. Discontinued operations are more fully
discussed in

Note 2: Discontinued Operations

in the
Notes.

We changed our segment reporting structure effective
May 28, 2004 in conjunction with the sale of our TTS
product line. The TTS product line was formerly part of the
Network Support segment. As a result of the sale, our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes report the TTS
product line as a discontinued operation, and accordingly, prior
periods have been restated. We also have eliminated the Network
Support segment as a separate reportable segment. The
NetBoss® network operations product line, which was also
part of the Network Support segment, was not included in the
sale and is now consolidated in the Microwave Communications
segment for all periods presented. The NetBoss® management
team reports to the President of the Microwave Communications
Division.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Our cash and cash
equivalents decreased $250 million to $378 million in
fiscal 2005, primarily due to the $427 million paid for the
acquisitions of Orkand and Encoda, $75 million of plant and
equipment additions, $56 million of common stock
repurchases and $32 million of cash dividends. These
decreases were partially offset by $301 million of cash
flow generated from operating activities.

Management currently believes that existing cash, funds
generated from operations, sales of marketable securities, our
credit facilities and access to the public and private debt
markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated
requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases under the current repurchase program for the next
12 months and the foreseeable future. We expect tax
payments over the next three years to approximate our tax
expense during the same period. We anticipate that our fiscal
2006 cash payments will include strategic acquisitions. With the
exception of potential acquisitions, no other significant cash
payments are anticipated in fiscal 2006 and thereafter, other
than those noted in the “Contractual Obligations”
discussion below.

On August 31, 2005, we announced that we entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares of Leitch.
Total price consideration, net of cash on hand, will be
approximately $450 million excluding acquisition costs. We
expect that the amount of consideration will be paid out of both
interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under
our available credit arrangements.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
continue to generate cash flow at current levels, or that
anticipated operational improvements will be achieved. If we are
unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash
flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be
required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, terminate
our stock repurchase program, refinance all or a portion of our
existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our ability to
make scheduled principal payments or pay interest on or
refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and
financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to
general conditions in or affecting the defense, microwave
communications and broadcast communications markets and to
general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative
and regulatory factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities:

Our net
cash provided by operating activities was $301.4 million in
fiscal 2005 compared to $270.3 million in fiscal 2004,
which represents a 12 percent increase. The positive cash
flows from operating activities in fiscal 2005 are primarily due
to improved profitability in all four of our business segments,
improved capital management in our Broadcast Communications
segment, and tax refunds collected in fiscal 2005 related to the
settlement of an audit. These cash flow improvements were
partially offset by an increase in working capital needed to
support the growth in our Government Communications Systems and
RF Communications segments, the funding of our supplemental
executive retirement program and the timing of payroll tax
payments. Our Government Communications Systems, RF
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments each
contributed positive cash flows from operations and each had
higher cash flows from operations during fiscal 2005 when
compared to fiscal 2004. The Microwave Communications segment
had lower cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 when compared
to fiscal 2004 and was cash neutral during fiscal 2005 due to
the building of inventory as we ramp up production of our
TRuepoint

tm

products while continuing to support and ship the products
TRuepoint

tm

will eventually replace. We expect cash flow provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2006 to be in the
$275 million to $300 million range.

Net cash used in investing activities:

Our net
cash used in investing activities was $488.9 million in
fiscal 2005 compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$16.6 million in fiscal 2004. Net cash used in investing
activities in fiscal 2005 was due to cash paid for business
acquisitions of $427.3 million and additions of plant and
equipment of $75.0 million, which was partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of securities available-for-sale of
$13.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities in
fiscal 2004 was due to additions of plant and equipment of
$66.4 million and cash paid for selected investment of
$2.8 million, which was offset partially by proceeds from
the sale of securities available-for-sale of $7.9 million
and proceeds from the sale of our TTS product line of
$44.7 million.

The increase in our additions of plant and equipment from
$66.4 million in fiscal 2004 to $75.0 million in
fiscal 2005 was related to spending on programs that are driving
the revenue growth in our Government Communications Systems and
RF Communications segments. Our total additions of plant and
equipment in fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the
$80 million to $90 million range.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities:

Our net cash used in financing activities in
fiscal 2005 was $63.3 million compared to net cash used in
financing activities in fiscal 2004 of $69.7 million. The
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 was
primarily due to repurchases of our common stock of
$56.4 million



and $31.9 million of cash dividends paid. Net payments of
borrowings in fiscal 2005 were $8.4 million. Proceeds from
the exercise of employee stock options of $33.4 million in
fiscal 2005 partially offset these payments. In fiscal 2005, we
issued 2,224,816 shares of common stock, on a post-split
basis, to employees under the terms of our option and incentive
plans.

Our net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 was
$69.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing
activities in fiscal 2003 of $95.0 million. The net cash
used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to
repurchases of our common stock of $56.5 million and
$26.6 million of cash dividends paid. Net payments of
borrowings in fiscal 2004 were $23.6 million, as we reduced
short-term debt in our foreign subsidiaries. Proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options of $37.0 million in
fiscal 2004 partially offset these payments. In fiscal 2004, we
issued 2,625,678 shares of common stock, on a post-split
basis, to employees under the terms of our option and incentive
plans.

Common Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2005, we used $56.4 million to
repurchase 1,874,000 shares of our common stock at an
average price per share of $30.10 including commissions. In
fiscal 2004, we used $56.5 million to
repurchase 2,608,800 shares of our common stock at an
average price per share of $21.65 including commissions. We
currently expect that we will repurchase shares of common stock
to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock
incentive plans. Additionally, if warranted, we will consider
accelerating our purchases. Additional information regarding
repurchases made during fiscal 2005 and our repurchase programs
is set forth under Part II, Item 5, “Market For
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Dividend Policy

On August 27, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.08 per share, on a
post-stock split basis, for an annualized rate of $0.32 per
share, which was our fourth consecutive annual increase. Our
annual common stock dividend, on a post-stock split basis, was
$0.24, $0.20, and $0.16 per share in fiscal 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Additional information concerning our
dividends is set forth under Part II, Item 5,
“Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities.”

Capital Structure and Resources

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
Agreement replaces our prior $300 million four-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement, dated October 15,
2003. The Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit
to us in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit
issuances at any time and from time to time during the term of
the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to exceed $500 million (we may request
an increase not to exceed $250 million). The Credit
Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes and to support any commercial paper that we
may issue. At our election, borrowings under the Credit
Agreement will bear interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable
margin or at the base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate
equal to the higher of the Federal funds rate plus
0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced
prime lending rate. The Credit Agreement provides that the
interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set at
0.50 percent, will increase or decrease within certain
limits based on changes in the ratings of our senior, unsecured
long-term debt securities. We are also permitted to request
borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set
pursuant to competitive bid procedures or directly negotiated
with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
covenants limiting liens on our assets; limiting certain
mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; limiting certain
sale and leaseback transactions; limiting certain vendor
financing investments; and limiting the use of proceeds for
hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also prohibits our
consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total capital from
being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our consolidated
ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense from being less
than 3.00 to 1.00 for any four-quarter period. The Credit
Agreement contains certain events of default, including payment
defaults; failure to perform or observe terms and covenants;
material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; default
under other indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
$50 million; the occurrence of one or more judgments or
orders for the payment of money in excess of $50 million
that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability
in excess of $50 million; failure to pay debts as they come
due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of control, including if a
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent
or more of our voting stock. If an event of default occurs the
lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments



and declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued
interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. All
amounts borrowed or outstanding under the Credit Agreement are
due and mature on March 31, 2010, unless the commitments
are terminated earlier either at our request or if certain
events of default occur. At July 1, 2005, no borrowings
were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

We have a “universal shelf” registration statement
related to the potential future issuance of up to
$500 million of securities, including debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock, fractional interests in preferred
stock represented by depositary shares and warrants to purchase
debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million of
3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022. These debentures are
convertible at a conversion price of $22.625 during any calendar
quarter if the closing price of our common stock, for at least
20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
on the last trading day of the prior calendar quarter, is more
than $24.8875, and in certain other circumstances as described
in

Note 16: Net Income Per Share

in the Notes. Based
upon satisfaction of the market price trigger as of the end of
the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2005, these debentures
are convertible during the calendar quarter ended
September 30, 2005 into shares of our common stock. In
addition to our $150 million 3.5% Convertible
Debentures, we have outstanding unsecured long-term debt of
$251.4 million. The earliest material maturity date of any
long-term debt is fiscal 2008.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
$15.9 million from various international banks, all of
which was available on July 1, 2005. These lines provide
for borrowings at various interest rates, may typically be
terminated upon notice, may be used on such terms as mutually
agreed to by the banks and us and are reviewed annually for
renewal or modification. These lines do not require compensating
balances. We have a short-term commercial paper program in
place, which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash
requirements. There were no borrowings under the commercial
paper program at July 1, 2005.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB” by Standard and
Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by Moody’s
Investors Service. We currently expect to maintain operating
ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios
sufficient for retention of these debt ratings. There are no
assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in the
future. If our credit rating is lowered below “investment
grade,” then we may not be able to issue short-term
commercial paper, but would instead need to borrow under our
other credit facilities or pursue other alternatives. We do not
currently foresee losing our investment-grade debt ratings. If
our debt ratings were downgraded, however, it could adversely
impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and
access to capital markets.

Contractual Obligations

At July 1, 2005, we had contractual cash obligations to
repay debt (including capital lease obligations, which are
immaterial), to purchase goods and services and to make payments
under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term
obligations are as follows:

The purchase obligations of $425.8 million noted above
    include $348.0 million of purchase obligations related to
    our Government Communications Systems segment, which are fully
    funded under contracts with the U.S. Government.
    $135.0 million of these purchase obligations relate to
    cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following
qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and



•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as
defined above. As of the end of fiscal 2005, we did not have
material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In
addition, we are not currently a party to any related party
transactions that materially affect our results of operations,
cash flows or financial condition.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover
various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental
liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot estimate the
potential liability from such representations, warranties and
indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. We do not
believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these
representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
the event any of these third parties vacates any of these
premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not
material to our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Commercial Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
performance on certain contracts to provide products and
services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with our
insurance carriers. At July 1, 2005, we had commercial
commitments on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and
other arrangements, as follows:

Financial Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use foreign
exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and
off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments.
Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign
currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from
suppliers, accounts receivable



from and future committed sales to customers and intercompany
loans. We believe the use of foreign currency financial
instruments should reduce the risks that arise from doing
business in international markets. At July 1, 2005, we had
open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
$73.3 million, of which $48.6 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $24.7 million were classified as
fair value hedges. This compares to total foreign exchange
contracts with a notional amount of $93.9 million as of
July 2, 2004, of which $30.0 million were classified
as cash flow hedges and $63.9 million were classified as
fair value hedges. At July 1, 2005, contract expiration
dates range from less than one month to 17 months with a
weighted average contract life of 6 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
exposures from cash flows anticipated from the Bowman program in
our RF Communications segment, operating expenses in our
Microwave Communications segment’s Canadian operations and
payments to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of our
government contracts in our Government Communications Systems
segment. The Bowman contract is for our tactical radio products
and was awarded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the
contract, the customer pays in Pounds Sterling. We have hedged
the forecasted cash flows related to payments made to our
U.S. operations to maintain our anticipated profit margins.
We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to
maintain our anticipated profit margins in our U.K. operations.
As of July 1, 2005, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
$0.7 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next month related to the cash
flow hedges for the Bowman program. As of July 1, 2005, we
estimated that pre-tax income of $0.3 million would be
reclassified into earnings from comprehensive income within the
next 12 months related to the cash flow hedges for the
operating expenses of our Microwave Communications
segment’s Canadian operations. As of July 1, 2005, we
estimated that a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million would be
reclassified into earnings from comprehensive income within the
next 17 months related to the cash flow hedges for payments
to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of our government
contracts in our Government Communications Systems segment. No
pretax income or loss would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income over the next 15 months from the other
transactions we are hedging as of July 1, 2005.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No amounts were
recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 related
to the component of the derivative instruments’ gain or
loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In
addition, no amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 related to hedged firm commitments that no
longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of these derivatives
were recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (“Statement 133”).

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging
programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
derivatives held at July 1, 2005 would have an impact of
approximately $5.7 million on the fair value of such
instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and
firm commitments.

Interest Rates:

We utilize a balanced mix of debt
maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and
available lines of credit to manage our exposure to changes in
interest rates. We do not expect changes in interest rates to
have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal 2006,
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
change significantly.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 42 percent of our international business was
transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2005,
compared to 39 percent in fiscal 2004. The impact of
translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
U.S. dollars is included as a component of
shareholders’ equity. At July 1, 2005, the cumulative
translation adjustment reduced shareholders’ equity by
$3.3 million compared to a reduction of $6.1 million
at July 2, 2004. We utilize foreign currency hedging
instruments to minimize the currency risk of international
transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate
fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in
fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.



Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
cost of purchased materials and services.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies
are more fully described in

Note 1: Significant
Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing our financial
statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and
balances, we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the
Notes. We consider the policies discussed below as critical to
an understanding of our financial statements because their
application places the most significant demands on our judgment,
with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks
for these critical accounting policies are described in the
following paragraphs. The impact and any associated risks
related to these policies on our business operations are
discussed throughout this MD&A where such policies affect
our reported and expected financial results. Senior management
has discussed the development and selection of the critical
accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
policy criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
based on experience and other information available prior to the
issuance of the financial statements. Materially different
results can occur as circumstances change and additional
information becomes known, including for estimates that we do
not deem “critical.”

Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Contracts and Contract
Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from long-term
development and production contracts, which are accounted for
under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position
No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP 81-1”), and cost-reimbursable contracts
with the U.S. Government also are specifically accounted
for in accordance with Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 11, Section A,
“Government Contracts, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee Contracts”
(“ARB 43”).

Revenue related to long-term contracts are recorded using the
percentage-of-completion method generally measured by the costs
incurred on each contract to-date against estimated total
contract costs at completion (“cost-to-cost”) with
consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
profit. The percentage-of-completion method of revenue
recognition is primarily used in our Government Communications
Systems and RF Communications segments. Revenue is recorded on
certain long-term production contracts within our RF
Communications segment using the units of delivery method rather
than the cost-to-cost method. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract. Amounts representing contract change orders,
claims or other items that may change the scope of a contract
are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated
and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award
fees applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally
are not recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally
are not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the
segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1.

Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a
single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit
for each contract over its entire period of performance.
Recognition of profit on long-term fixed-price contracts
requires estimates of: the contract value or total contract
revenue, the total cost at completion, and the measurement of
progress toward completion. The estimated profit or loss on a
contract is equal to the difference between the estimated
contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. Due
to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the
estimated total cost at completion often requires significant
judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work
to be completed include labor



productivity and availability of labor, the nature and
complexity of the work to be performed, availability and cost of
materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of delayed
performance, availability and timing of funding from the
customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
contract included in any estimate to complete. We review cost
performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts
at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a
change in estimated cost to complete a contract is determined to
have an impact on contract earnings, we will record a positive
or negative adjustment to estimated earnings when identified.
Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable contract are
recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal
to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. These
profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of allowable
costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement. Thus,
cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to the
same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We have
not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
recognize revenue on long-term contracts or to estimate our
costs related to long-term contracts in the past three fiscal
years.

As of July 1, 2005, the amount of unbilled costs and
accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet was $119.7 million compared to
$111.1 million as of July 2, 2004. These amounts
include gross costs and accrued income, which is netted against
billings and progress payments. A significant change in an
estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on
our statement of financial position and results of operations.
For example, a one percent variance in our estimate of accrued
income booked as of July 1, 2005 on all open fixed-price
contracts would impact our pre-tax income and our cost of
product sales and services by $5.4 million.

Provisions for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. The review of excess and obsolete
inventory primarily relates to our Microwave Communications,
Broadcast Communications and RF Communications segments. Several
factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories,
including our decisions to exit a product line, technological
change and new product development. These factors could result
in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on
hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may
prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or
overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete
inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is
overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in
“Cost of product sales” in our Consolidated Statement
of Income at the time of such determination. Likewise, if we
determine our inventory is undervalued, we may have overstated
“Cost of product sales” in previous periods and would
be required to recognize such additional income. We have not
made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to
establish our inventory loss reserves during the past three
fiscal years.

As of July 1, 2005, our reserve for obsolete and excess
inventory was $56.7 million, or 19.8 percent of our
gross inventory balance, which compares to our reserve of
$52.7 million, or 19.3 percent of the gross inventory
balance as of July 2, 2004. We recorded $4.0 million,
$5.0 million and $15.4 million in inventory write-down
charges during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
fiscal 2003, inventory write-downs of $8.6 million related
to our exit from unprofitable products and the shutdown of our
Brazilian manufacturing plant in the Microwave Communications
segment. Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the
accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, including
the impact of planned future product launches, any significant
unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments
could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
and our reported operating results.

Valuation of Selected Investments

Selected investments are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting and are evaluated for impairment if cost exceeds fair
value. For those investments that are illiquid and privately
held securities that do not have readily determinable fair
values, the determination of fair value requires management to
obtain independent appraisals, or to estimate the value of the
securities without an independent appraisal based upon available
information such as projected cash flows, comparable market
prices of similar companies, recent acquisitions of similar
companies made in the marketplace and a review of the financial
and market conditions of the underlying company. We use judgment
in estimating the fair value based on our evaluation of the
investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate, terminal
value and long-term growth rate to apply in our calculations. In
instances where a security is subject to liquidation preferences
or transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based
primarily on the quoted price of the same security without
liquidation preferences or



transfer restrictions but may be reduced by an amount estimated
to reflect such preferences or restrictions. In addition, even
where the value of a selected investment is derived from an
independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain
assumptions may be required to determine whether our selected
investment is more or less marketable than those investments
being quoted. We evaluate our selected investments for
“other than temporary” impairment. Impairment may
exist when the fair value of a selected investment has been, or
is expected to be, below the carrying value for an extended
period of time. If an “other than temporary”
impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the
value of the selected investment recorded on the financial
statements and fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings
in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other
than temporary. We have not made any material changes in the
methodology used to determine the valuation of our selected
investments during the past three fiscal years.

As of July 1, 2005, the carrying amount of our selected
investments that are included in the “Other assets”
caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet is $39.3 million,
which compares to $37.8 million as of July 2, 2004.
Independent appraisals were obtained to derive the fair value of
these investments and $7.7 million other than temporary
impairment was recognized on these investments in fiscal 2005.
We make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our
estimate of the value of our selected investments. Any
significant unanticipated changes in the underlying assumptions
used by independent appraisers or us could have a significant
impact on these estimates.

Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”), we are required
to perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more
frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment
is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as one of our business segments, with its net
book value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second
step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
to acquire the reporting unit. We have not made any material
changes in the methodology used to determine the valuation of
our goodwill or the assessment of whether or not goodwill is
impaired during the past three fiscal years.

There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the
determination of the fair value of a reporting unit. These
assumptions include projected cash flows, discount rates,
comparable market prices of similar businesses, recent
acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace and a
review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying
business. We completed impairment tests as of April 1,
2005, with no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1,
2005 and July 2, 2004 was $569.9 million and
$223.3 million, respectively. Although we make every
reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the
fair value of our reporting units, future changes in the
assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the
recording of an impairment loss. A 10 percent variance,
however, in our estimate of any of our reporting units’
fair value would not lead to any further tests for impairment as
described above.

Income Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of



existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We
have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three
fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1, 2005 includes
a current deferred tax asset of $96.0 million and a
non-current deferred tax liability of $26.7 million. This
compares to a current deferred tax liability of
$114.1 million and a non-current deferred tax asset of
$2.8 million as of July 2, 2004. The variance between
these balances was primarily due to the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities related to identifiable intangible assets
acquired in our Encoda and Orkand acquisitions. For all
jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we
expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are
sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income
needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance
related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $47.7 million as of
July 1, 2005 and $38.7 million as of July 2,
2004. $8.3 million of the $47.7 million valuation
allowance as of July 1, 2005, is attributable to acquired
deferred tax assets any recognition of which will be reflected
as a change in goodwill. Although we make every reasonable
effort to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we
continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are
unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there
is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time
period within which the underlying temporary differences become
taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the
valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our
deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our
effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our
operating results.

Other Management Estimates

The majority of our revenue and, consequently, our outstanding
accounts receivable, are directly or indirectly with the
U.S. Government. Therefore, our risk of not collecting
amounts due us under such arrangements is minimal. We generally
require letters of credit or deposit payments prior to the
commencement of work or obtain progress payments upon the
achievement of certain milestones from our international
commercial customers. In addition, our revenue is supported by
contractual arrangements specifying the timing and amounts of
payments. We historically have experienced and expect to
continue to experience a minimal amount of uncollectible
accounts receivable. We have not made any material changes in
the methodologies used to determine our allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable during the past three fiscal
years. Changes in the underlying financial condition of our
customers or changes in the industries in which we operate
necessitating revisions to our standard contractual terms and
conditions could have an impact on our results of operations and
cash flows in the future.

We record a liability pertaining to pending litigation or
contingencies based on our best estimate of probable loss, if
any, or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances
where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of
uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the cost
to us, if any, of litigation we continually revise our estimated
losses as additional facts become known. We have not made any
material changes in the methodologies used to estimate
liabilities pertaining to pending litigation during the past
three fiscal years.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

As described in

Note 3: Accounting Changes or Recent
Pronouncements

in the Notes, there are accounting
pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet
been implemented by us. Note 3 describes the potential
impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE
RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
actual results to differ materially from expected and historical
results. Other factors besides those listed here also could
adversely affect us.

We participate in markets that are often subject to
uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to
estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income
and expenditures.

We participate in markets that are subject to uncertain economic
conditions. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level
of growth in some of the markets in which we participate.
Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are
dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the
uncertainty renders estimates of future income and expenditures
even more difficult than usual. As a result, we may make
significant investments and expenditures but never realize the
anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our results
of operations. The future direction of the overall domestic and
global economies also will have a significant impact on our
overall performance.



We depend on the U.S. Government for a significant
portion of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a
shift in U.S. Government funding could have adverse
consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the U.S. Government.
Approximately 66 percent, 66 percent and
62 percent of our net revenue in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, was derived from sales to the
U.S. Government. Therefore, any significant disruption or
deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government
could significantly reduce our revenue. Our U.S. Government
programs must compete with programs managed by other government
contractors for a limited number of programs and for uncertain
levels of funding. Our competitors continuously engage in
efforts to expand their business relationships with the
U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
future. The U.S. Government may choose to use other
contractors for its limited number of programs. In addition, the
funding of defense programs also competes with nondefense
spending of the U.S. Government. Budget decisions made by
the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have
long-term consequences for our business. A shift in
U.S. Government spending to other programs in which we are
not involved, or a reduction in U.S. Government spending
generally, could have material adverse consequences for our
business.

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government
contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to
immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The
termination or failure to fund one or more of these contracts
could have an adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
contracts may be planned or authorized in connection with major
procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal
year basis even though a program may continue for several years.
Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress
makes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a
U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenue attributable to that program. That
could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
funds to a program that already has been started could result in
lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment only
for work done and commitments made at the time of termination.
We can give no assurance that one or more of our
U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other
requirements. These requirements, although customary in
U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
debarment are violations of various statutes, including those
related to procurement integrity, export control,
U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the
recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
could have an adverse effect on our reputation and ability to
procure other U.S. Government contracts in the future.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us
to losses in the event of cost overruns.

Sometimes, we enter into contracts on a firm, fixed-price basis.
During fiscal 2005 and 2004, approximately 34 percent and
27 percent, respectively, of our total Government
Communications Systems and RF Communications segments’
sales were from fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit
from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost
overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial
estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts.
U.S. Government contracts can expose us to potentially
large losses because the U.S. Government can compel us to
complete a project or, in certain circumstances, pay the entire
cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the
size or foreseeability of any cost overruns



that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these
projects involve new technologies and applications and can last
for years, unforeseen events, such as technological
difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials,
problems with other contractors and cost overruns, can result in
the contractual price becoming less favorable or even
unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet
project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate
contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or
liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer
exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our
contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit
rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those
contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of
operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings
from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and
cost controls would have an adverse impact on our financial
results.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
business in foreign countries, including fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

We are highly dependent on sales to customers outside the United
States. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, revenue for products
exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad were
19 percent, 20 percent and 21 percent,
respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
42 percent of our international business in fiscal 2005 was
transacted in local currency environments. Losses resulting from
currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We
expect that international revenue will continue to account for a
significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant
portion of our international revenue is in less developed
countries. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing
business internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives
    and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult
to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our
operations in the future.

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop
new products that achieve market acceptance.

Both our commercial and defense businesses are characterized by
rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards.
Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of
factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our products by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Manufacture and bring cost-effective products to market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
we will need to continue to develop new products, which will
require the investment of significant financial resources in new
product development. The need to make these expenditures could
divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we
cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to
the timely development of new products. Due to the design
complexity of some of our products, we may experience delays in
completing development and introducing new products in the
future. Any delays could result in increased costs of
development or redirect resources from other projects. In
addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our
products will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of
our products to gain market acceptance could reduce
significantly our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we
cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing
products that gain market acceptance in advance of our products
or that our competitors will not develop new



products that cause our existing products to become obsolete. If
we fail in our new product development efforts or our products
fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than those of our
competitors, our revenue will decline and our business,
financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
affected.

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
events, but they may affect adversely the markets in which we
operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
our profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11,
2001, the subsequent U.S.-led military response and the
potential for future terrorist activities and other recent
geo-political events have created economic and political
uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our
business and the prices of our securities. These matters have
caused uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance
markets and may increase significantly the political, economic
and social instability in the geographic areas in which we
operate. These matters also have caused the premiums charged for
our insurance coverages to increase and may cause some coverages
to be unavailable altogether. While our government businesses
have benefited from homeland defense initiatives and the war on
terror, these developments may affect adversely our business and
profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we
cannot predict at this time.

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and
uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

The inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key
suppliers to manufacture and timely deliver our components or
products, could cause our products to be produced in an untimely
or unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. In addition,
there are certain parts or components, which we source from
other manufacturers. Some of our suppliers, from time to time,
experience financial and operational difficulties, which may
impact their ability to supply the materials, components and
subsystems that we require. Any inability to develop alternative
sources of supply on a cost-effective basis could materially
impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to
customers in a timely manner. We cannot give assurances that we
will not experience material supply problems or component or
subsystems problems in the future. Also, our subcontractors and
other suppliers may not be able to maintain the quality of the
materials, components and subsystems they supply, which might
result in greater product returns and could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in
the future that we are infringing upon their intellectual
property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our
intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and
we may be found to be infringing or to have infringed those
intellectual property rights. We do not believe that existing
claims of infringement will have a material impact on us;
however, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of
others that may cover some of our technology, products and
services. Claims of intellectual property infringement might
also require us to enter into costly royalty or license
agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or
license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also
may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against
development and sale of certain of our products. Our success
depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on
a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements
to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to
successfully protect and enforce our intellectual property
rights, our competitive position could suffer. Our pending
patent and trademark registration applications may not be
allowed, or competitors



may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or
trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not
provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be
required to spend significant resources to monitor and police
our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect
infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before
we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our
technology or develop competing technologies.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
matter could have a material adverse affect on our financial
position and results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are
involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert
financial and management resources that would otherwise be used
to benefit our operations. Although we believe that we have
meritorious defenses to the claims made in each and all of the
litigation or arbitration matters to which we are a party, and
intend to contest each lawsuit and proceeding vigorously, no
assurances can be given that the results of these matters will
be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these
lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse affect on
our financial position.

We are subject to customer credit risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term customer
financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been able to
place a portion of our customer financings with third-party
lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this risk, a
portion of these financings is provided directly by us. There
can be higher risks associated with some of these financings,
particularly when provided to start-up operations such as local
network providers, to customers in developing countries or to
customers in specific financing-intensive areas of the
telecommunications industry. If customers fail to meet their
obligations, losses could be incurred and such losses could have
an adverse effect on us. Our losses could be much greater if it
becomes more difficult to place or insure against these risks
with third parties. We have various programs in place to monitor
and mitigate customer credit risk; however, we cannot provide
assurances that such measures will be effective in reducing our
exposure to our customers’ credit risk.

The fair values of our portfolio of passive investments
are subject to significant price volatility or erosion.

We have investments in securities of privately-held companies,
many of which still can be considered in the start-up or
developmental stages. These investments are illiquid and are
inherently risky as the markets for the technologies or products
they have under development are typically in the early stages
and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment
in these companies.

Developing new technologies entails significant risks and
uncertainties.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
associated with these systems and products may be untested or
unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control systems,
homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
circumstances we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
insurance coverage could harm our financial condition and
operating results. Moreover, any accident or incident for which
we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect
our reputation among our customers and the public, thereby
making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
insurance in the future.

We have significant operations in Florida that could be
impacted in the event of a hurricane and operations in
California that could be impacted in the event of an
earthquake.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
Government Communications Systems segment are located in
Florida. In addition, our Broadcast Communications and Microwave
Communications segments have locations near major earthquake
fault lines in California. In the event of a major hurricane,
earthquake or other natural disaster we could experience
business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or loss of
life, all of which could materially adversely affect our
business.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates,
fluctuations in the market value of our marketable equity
securities available-for-sale and changes in interest rates. We
employ established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. For
a discussion of such policies and procedures and the related
risks, see “Financial Risk Management” in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated
by reference into this Item 7A.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance, based on an appropriate cost benefit analysis,
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
condition, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of July 1,
2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s
assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of July 1, 2005.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
internal controls of Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc.
(“Encoda”) acquired by the Company during 2005, which
is included in the 2005 consolidated financial statements of the
Company and constituted $405 million and $360 million
of total and net assets, respectively, as of July 1, 2005.
The amounts of Encoda’s revenue and income before income
taxes for the year ended July 1, 2005 were immaterial.
Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting at Encoda because of the timing of the
acquisition, which was completed in November 2004.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on
management’s assessment and the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This
report appears on page 52.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Harris Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 1, 2005 and
July 2, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows, and comprehensive income and
shareholders’ equity, for each of the three years in the
period ended July 1, 2005. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries at
July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended July 1, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Harris Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of July 1, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Harris Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
July 1, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Harris Corporation’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc. (Encoda) acquired
during 2005, which is included in the 2005 consolidated
financial statements of Harris Corporation and constituted
$405 million and $360 million of total and net assets,
respectively, as of July 1, 2005. The amounts of
Encoda’s revenue and income before income taxes for the
year ended July 1, 2005 were immaterial. Management did not
assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting at Encoda because of the timing of the acquisition,
which was completed in November 2004. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting of Harris Corporation also did
not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial
reporting of Encoda.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Harris
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of July 1, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of July 1, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation and
subsidiaries as of July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity, for each of
the three years in the period ended July 1, 2005 and our
report dated August 23, 2005, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation —

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
and its subsidiaries. As used in these notes, the terms
“Harris,” “we,” “our” and
“us” refer to Harris Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts
have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates —

These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based
on experience and other information available prior to issuance
of the financial statements. Materially different results can
occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes
known.

Fiscal Year —

Our fiscal year ends on the
Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2005 includes 52 weeks,
fiscal 2004 includes 53 weeks, and fiscal 2003 includes
52 weeks.

Common Stock Split —

On February 25, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a 100 percent stock dividend to our stockholders of
record on March 14, 2005. The distribution of shares was
completed on March 30, 2005. The total number of authorized
shares and associated par value were unchanged by this action.
As required, we transferred on our books the par value of
$1 per share for each share distributed on March 30,
2005 from other capital to common stock. All share and per-share
amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated
Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
and Shareholders’ Equity and these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements reflect the stock split, applied
retroactively, for all periods presented.

Cash Equivalents —

Cash equivalents are
temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
months when purchased. These investments include accrued
interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable securities
are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net
of tax, included as a separate component of shareholders’
equity. Realized gains and losses from marketable securities are
determined using the specific identification method. If an
“other than temporary” impairment is determined to
exist, the difference between the value of the investment
security recorded on the financial statements and our current
estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in
the period in which the impairment is determined.

The marketable securities had no cost basis at July 1, 2005
and a cost basis of $17.2 million at July 2, 2004. The
proceeds from the sale of marketable securities were
$13.4 million in fiscal 2005, $7.9 million in fiscal
2004 and $30.1 million in fiscal 2003. The amount of
realized gains (losses) included in “Non-operating income
(loss)” was $(3.7) million in fiscal 2005,
$2.3 million in fiscal 2004 and $21.2 million in
fiscal 2003. Included in these realized gains (losses) were
write-downs for other than temporary decreases in the market
value of $0.7 million in fiscal 2003.

As of July 2, 2004, we had one marketable security that was
in an unrealized loss position. The investment is in
Barclay’s Global Investors S&P 500 Fund, which is a
mutual fund that tracks the Standard and Poors 500 index.
As of July 2, 2004, our carrying value in this investment
was $15.5 million, the market value of the investment was
$12.0 million and the unrealized loss was
$3.5 million. The investment has been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for over 12 months. Based on the
diversified nature of this investment and the Fund’s direct
correlation with the U.S. economy, we believe that this
investment’s carrying amount is recoverable within a
reasonable period of time.

Selected Investments —

Selected investments are
investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
estimate the value of the securities without an independent
appraisal based upon available information such as projected
cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
underlying company. In fiscal 2005, “Non-operating income
(loss)” in our Consolidated Statement of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Income included impairment write-downs of $3.8 million
related to our investment in AuthenTec, $2.9 million
related to our investment in Terion and $1.0 million
related to our interest in Teltronics, Inc. In 2004, a
$5.0 million write-down was recorded as an impairment of
our interest in Teltronics, Inc. We have $39.3 million of
selected investments at July 1, 2005 and $37.8 million
at July 2, 2004 that are included in the “Other
assets” caption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, for
which we have obtained independent appraisals. See Note 9:
Selected Investments for additional information.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments —

The
carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cost method
investments, receivables, notes receivable and short-term and
long-term debt approximate their fair values, except for our
3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022, which have a fair value in
excess of their carrying value. Fair values are based primarily
on quoted market prices for those or similar instruments or
independent appraisals. A discussion of fair values for our
derivative financial instruments is included under the caption
“Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this
Significant Accounting Policies note.

Accounts Receivable —

We record receivables at
net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for
estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated
on the accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision
for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our
history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic
status of the customers. See Note 5: Receivables for
additional information.

Inventories —

Inventories are valued at the
lower of cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out
methods) or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. See Note 6: Inventories and
Unbilled Costs for additional information regarding inventories.

Plant and Equipment —

Plant and equipment are
carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of buildings,
machinery and equipment is computed by the straight-line and
accelerated methods. The estimated useful lives of buildings
range between 5 and 50 years. The estimated useful lives of
machinery and equipment range between 3 and 10 years. See
Note 7: Plant and Equipment for additional information
regarding plant and equipment.

Income Taxes —

We follow the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
tax planning strategies. See Note 22: Income Taxes for
additional information regarding income taxes.

Goodwill —

Goodwill represents the excess cost
of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”), indefinite-life
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
which we define as our business segments, with its net book
value or carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any
unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the
reporting unit. See Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets for additional information regarding goodwill.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangible
Assets —

We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between
the fair value and the carrying amount. See Note 7: Plant
and Equipment and Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets for additional information regarding long-lived assets
and identifiable intangible assets.

Other Accrued Items and Other Assets —

No
accrued liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other
accrued items” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceed
5 percent of our total current liabilities as of
July 1, 2005 or as of July 2, 2004. No current assets
other than those already disclosed on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet exceed 5 percent of our total current assets as of
July 1, 2005 or as of July 2, 2004. No assets within
the caption “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet exceed 5 percent of total assets as of July 1,
2005 or as of July 2, 2004.

Warranties —

On long-term contract sales in our
Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
segments, the value or price of our warranty is generally
included in the contract and funded by the customer. A provision
for warranties is built into the estimated program costs when
determining the profit rate to accrue when applying the
cost-to-cost percentage of completion revenue recognition
method. Warranty costs, if incurred, are charged to the specific
program’s cost and both revenue and cost are recognized at
that time. Factors that affect the estimated program cost for
warranty include terms of the contract, number of installed
units, historical experience and management’s judgment
regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per
claim.

On product sales in our RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications segments, we provide
for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific
terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
product sold and country in which we do business. In the case of
products sold by us, our warranties generally start from the
delivery date and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to ten years

Microwave Communications

Two to three years

Broadcast Communications

One to five years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of installed units, historical experience and
management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
Communications segment and network management software products
sold by our Microwave Communications segment generally carry a
30 to 90 day warranty from the date of acceptance. Our
liability under these warranties is either to provide a
corrected copy of any portion of the software found not to be in
substantial compliance with the agreed upon specifications, or
to provide a full refund.

Our software license agreements in our Broadcast Communications
and Microwave Communications segments generally include certain
provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities should
our software products infringe a third party’s intellectual
property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material
costs as a result of such indemnification and have not accrued
any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated
financial statements. See Note 10: Accrued Warranties for
additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation —

The functional
currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
of exchange and income and expense items are translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Unearned Compensation —

Compensation resulting
from performance shares granted under our stock incentive plan
is amortized to expense over the performance period and is
adjusted for changes in the market value of our common stock.

Compensation resulting from restricted shares granted under our
stock incentive plan is amortized to expense over the vesting
period based on the price of our common stock on the grant date.

Stock Options and Stock-Based Compensation —

In
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” we use the
intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option awards to
employees and, accordingly, do not recognize compensation
expense for our stock option awards to employees in the
Consolidated Statement of Income, as all option exercise prices
are 100 percent of market value on the date the options are
granted. Options may be exercised for a period set at the time
of initial grant, which ranges from 7 to 10 years after the
date of grant.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net
income and earnings per share assuming we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to all previously granted
stock-based awards after giving consideration to potential
forfeitures. The fair value of each option grant is estimated at
the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
estimated fair value of options granted is amortized to expense
over their vesting period, which is generally three years.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the grant
date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions:




Expected dividend yield

0.7

%

1.0

%

0.8

%

Expected stock price volatility

35.2

%

37.1

%

36.4

%

Risk-free interest rate

3.0

%

1.9

%

2.2

%

Expected life (years)




The weighted average fair value of options at their grant date
during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, where the
exercise price equaled the market price on the grant date, was
$7.87, $4.89 and $4.84, respectively. The weighted average fair
values of restricted and performance shares at their grant date
during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, were $25.47,
$16.57 and $15.91, respectively. See Note 15: Stock Options
and Awards for additional information regarding stock options,
performance shares and restricted shares.

Revenue Recognition

Our segments have the following revenue recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems segment:

Revenue in our
Government Communications Systems segment primarily relates to
long-term contracts. Recognition of profit on long-term
fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the total contract
value; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
progress towards completion. Revenue and profits on
cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized as allowable costs are



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

incurred on the contract and become billable to the customer, in
an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the profit on those
costs. Revenue and anticipated profits under long-term contracts
are recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally
using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales and
profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to
estimated total costs at completion. Contracts are combined when
specific aggregation criteria stated in the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountant’s Statement of Position
No. 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
(“SOP 81-1”), are met. Criteria generally include
closely interrelated activities performed for a single customer
within the same economic environment. Contracts generally are
not segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the
segmenting criteria stated in SOP 81-1. Amounts
representing contract change orders, claims or other items are
included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and
realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and awards
applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is
sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
performance. Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease
earnings based solely on a single significant event, are
generally not recognized until the event occurs. When
adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product and service sales
other than long-term contracts, which is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed
or determinable, collectibility is probable and delivery of a
product has occurred and title has transferred or services have
been rendered. Further, if an arrangement other than a long-term
contract requires the delivery or performance of multiple
deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we determine
whether the individual elements represent “separate units
of accounting” under the requirements of Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue 00-21, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements” (“EITF 00-21”). If the
separate elements meet the requirements listed in
EITF 00-21, we recognize the revenue associated with each
element separately. If the elements within a bundled sale are
not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an
individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
are undelivered elements that are essential to the
functionality. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized
by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts.
Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance
exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless
these obligations are satisfied.

RF Communications segment:

Revenue in our RF
Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
sales. Revenue recognition from long-term contracts and other
than long-term contracts sales follows the same policies as
stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above except that our
RF Communications segment sometimes uses the units of delivery
method of accounting rather than the cost-to-cost method of
accounting for production contracts that call for the delivery
of larger quantities of products. Under the units of delivery
method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
under the contract.

Microwave Communications segment:

Revenue in our
Microwave Communications segment primarily relates to product
and services sales. Revenue recognition from long-term contracts
and other than long-term contracts sales follows the same
policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in our
Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to product
and services sales. Revenue recognition from long-term contracts
and other than long-term contracts sales follows the same
policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
segment’s revenue recognition policy above. This segment
derives a portion of its revenue from the sale of software with
multi-year maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue
allocated to undelivered elements under these bundled software
sales is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value for those elements using the residual method. Under the
residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered
elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is
recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the
undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to
delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements
is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the
maintenance agreement.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a component of
“Non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis of terms
specified in contractual agreements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on
the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Revenue from
product sales” and the associated costs are classified in
“Cost of product sales.”

Retirement Benefits —

As of July 1, 2005,
we provide retirement benefits to substantially all employees
primarily through a defined contribution retirement plan having
profit sharing, matching and savings elements. Contributions by
us to the retirement plan are based on profits and
employees’ savings with no other funding requirements. We
may make additional contributions to the plan at our discretion.
Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited healthcare
plan for U.S.-based retirees and employees on long-term
disability. We accrue the estimated cost of these medical
benefits, which are not material, during an employee’s
active service life.

Retirement plan expense amounted to $87.0 million in fiscal
2005, $71.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $57.3 million
in fiscal 2003.

Environmental Expenditures —

We capitalize
environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 13 sites
where future liabilities could exist. These sites include two
sites owned by us, six sites associated with our former graphics
or semiconductor locations and five treatment or disposal sites
not owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
attributable to us from past operations. Based on an assessment
of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
liability under the Superfund Act and other environmental
statutes and regulations for identified sites, using a
7.5 percent discount rate, is approximately
$4.8 million. This liability is accrued in the July 1,
2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The expected aggregate
undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next 15 to
20 years (depending on the number of years for each site)
is approximately $7.5 million. The expected payments for
the next five years are: fiscal 2006 —
$0.6 million; fiscal 2007 — $0.9 million;
fiscal 2008 — $0.8 million; fiscal
2009 — $0.5 million; fiscal 2010 —
$0.7 million; and the aggregate amount thereafter is
approximately $4.0 million. The relevant factors we
considered in estimating our potential liabilities under the
Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
include cost-sharing agreements with other parties and the
potential indemnification from successor and predecessor owners
of these sites. We do not believe that uncertainties with
respect to these relevant factors would materially affect our
potential liability under the Superfund Act and other
environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial Commitments —

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued to guarantee
the performance of a customer to a third party in borrowing
arrangements, such as commercial paper issuances, bond
financings and similar transactions. The terms of the guarantees
are equal to the remaining term of the related debt, which are
limited to one year or less. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under our
guarantees at July 1, 2005 is $0.4 million. At
July 1, 2005, there are no guarantees accrued for in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also hold insurance policies with
third parties to mitigate the risk of loss on a portion of these
guarantees. We have entered into commercial commitments in the
normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter
of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial
institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee
of future performance on certain contracts to provide products
and services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with
our insurance carriers. At July 1, 2005, we had commercial
commitments of $67.7 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management —

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“Statement 133”), requires us
to recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted
to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value
of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair
value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through
earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion
of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a combination of
foreign currency call options and foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge against risks associated with anticipated
cash flows that are probable of occurring in the future and cash
flows that are fixed or firmly committed. These derivatives have
only nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase and have a
high degree of correlation to the anticipated cash flows they
are designated to hedge. Hedge effectiveness is determined by
the correlation of the anticipated cash flows and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

the maturity dates of the derivatives used to hedge these cash
flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge against the
currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with
anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement 133, such financial instruments are
marked-to-market using forward prices and fair value quotes with
the offset to other comprehensive income, net of hedge
ineffectiveness. The foreign currency call options and forward
contracts are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Cost of product sales” on the Consolidated Statement
of Income when the underlying net cash flows are realized.
Unrealized losses are recorded in “Other accrued
items” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to
other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.
Unrealized gains are recorded as “Other assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
position with each counterparty. In the event of the termination
of a derivative designated as a hedge, the settlement would be
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as a component
of “Non-operating income (loss).”

Net Income Per Share —

Net income per share is
based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year. See Note 16: Net Income Per
Share for additional information regarding net income per share.

Reclassifications —

Certain prior-year amounts
have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements
to conform with current year classifications.

NOTE 2:

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On May 28, 2004, we completed the sale of our tools and
test systems (“TTS”) product line, which was included
in our Network Support segment, for approximately
$43.1 million after giving effect to post-closing
adjustments. As a result of this transaction, the TTS product
line has been reported as a discontinued operation for all
periods presented.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of land, buildings,
equipment, inventory, receivables, technology and other assets
related to the operation of the TTS product line. We recorded an
after-tax gain on the sale of our TTS product line of
$9.1 million. This gain was net of the disposal of
$13.8 million of related goodwill.

Summarized financial information for our discontinued operations
is as follows:

The information set forth in the other Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements relates to continuing operations unless
otherwise specified.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES OR RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP
106-2”), with an effective date for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. FSP 106-2
relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Medicare Prescription Drug
Act”), which was signed into law on December 8, 2003.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Act introduced a prescription
drug benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we adopted the
provisions of FSP 106-2. Our retirees who are Medicare-eligible
pay retiree premiums equal to the cost of their coverage. We
subsidize the healthcare coverage for disabled employees, some
of whom are Medicare-eligible. We have applied for the subsidy
related to our disabled employee coverage and are waiting on
acceptance of our application. Due to the retiree cost-sharing
arrangements and the status of our application, neither our
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation nor our net
periodic post-retirement benefit cost reflects any amount
associated with the subsidy. We do not believe, however, that
when our actuarial valuation is completed the federal subsidy
for disabled employees who are Medicare-eligible will have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In October 2004, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04-8,
“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
Earnings per Share” (“EITF 04-8”).
EITF 04-8 requires that shares underlying contingently
convertible debt be included in diluted earnings per share
computations using the if-converted method regardless of whether
the market price trigger (or other contingent features) has been
met. The effective date for EITF 04-8 is for reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF 04-8 also
requires restatement of earnings per share amounts for prior
periods presented during which the convertible instrument was
outstanding. We implemented the provisions of EITF 04-8
during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and have restated the
prior periods presented. The provisions of EITF 04-8
increased our diluted shares outstanding by 6.6 million
shares. Also, the net earnings used in our earnings per share
calculations are adjusted, using the if-converted method. The
effect of these adjustments reduced our income from continuing
operations per diluted share by $0.04 in fiscal 2005, $0.02 in
fiscal 2004 and $0.00 in fiscal 2003. See Note 16: Net
Income Per Share for additional information.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 151, “Inventory
Costs — an amendment of ARB 43, Chapter 4”
(“Statement 151”). Statement 151 clarifies
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material. Paragraph 5 of
Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) 43,
Chapter 4 “Inventory Pricing,” previously stated
that “...under certain circumstances, items such as idle
facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and
rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as
current-period charges....” Statement 151 requires
that those items be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so
abnormal.” In addition, Statement 151 requires that
the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. Statement 151 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the
implementation of Statement 151 will have a material impact
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities (“IRC Sec. 199”)
provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”
(“FSP 109-1”), and FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP
109-2”). FSP 109-1 clarifies the guidance in FASB Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes” (“Statement 109”) that
applies to the new deduction for qualified domestic production
activities under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
“Act”). FSP 109-1 clarifies that the deduction should
be accounted for as a special deduction under
Statement 109, not as a tax-rate reduction, because the
deduction is contingent on performing activities identified in
the Act. As a result, companies qualifying for the special
deduction will not have a one-time adjustment of deferred tax
assets and liabilities in the period in which the Act was
enacted. FSP 109-2 addresses the effect of the Act’s
one-time deduction for qualifying repatriation of foreign
earnings. The IRC Sec. 199 deduction will be effective for our
fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. FSP 109-2 allows
additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign
earnings will be repatriated under the Act’s one-time
deduction



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

for repatriated earnings and how the Act affects whether
undistributed earnings continue to qualify for
Statement 109’s exception from recognizing deferred
tax liabilities. FSP 109-1 and FSP 109-2 were both effective
upon issuance. We implemented FSP 109-1 and FSP 109-2 and have
included the required disclosures in Note 22: Income Taxes.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment” (“Statement 123R”), which requires
all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based
payments (including employee stock options) at fair value and to
recognize cost over the vesting period. Statement 123R is
effective for public companies (except small business issuers as
defined in SEC Regulation S-B) for interim or annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
Statement 123R is not expected to have a significant effect
on our financial position or cash flows, but will impact our
results of operations. An illustration of the impact on our net
income and earnings per share is presented in the Stock Options
and Stock-Based Compensation section of Note 1: Significant
Accounting Policies assuming we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement 123 using the
Black-Scholes methodology. We have not yet determined whether we
will use the Black-Scholes method in our adoption of
Statement 123R. Also, we are unable to estimate the future
impact that Statement 123R will have on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows due to unknown
events, such as the type and number of share-based payments that
will be granted, their terms, and their vesting periods.

In March 2005, the SEC released SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment”
(“SAB 107”). SAB 107 provides the SEC staff
position regarding the application of Statement 123R, which
contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction
between Statement 123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations and provides the staff’s views regarding the
valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
companies. SAB 107 highlights the importance of disclosures
made related to the accounting for share-based payment
transactions. We believe Statement 123R and SAB 107
will not have a material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2005, the SEC announced that companies may implement
Statement 123R at the beginning of their next fiscal year
(instead of their next reporting period) beginning after
June 15, 2005, or December 15, 2005 for small business
issuers. This new rule does not affect our implementation date
since our fiscal year end is July 1, 2005, and thus we
still must comply with Statement 123R when our interim
financial statements for the quarter ending September 30,
2005 are filed with the SEC. The SEC’s new rule does not
change the accounting required by Statement 123R; it
changes only the dates for compliance.

In May 2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 154, “Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections” (“Statement 154”), which
replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes”
and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.” Statement 154 changes the requirements
for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. Statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes
in accounting principles, and applies to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the
pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.
Statement 154 requires retrospective application to prior
period financial statements for a change in accounting
principle. Previously, a change in accounting principle was
recognized by including the change in the net income in the
period of the change. Statement 154 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2005. We are currently
reviewing Statement 154, and at the current time do not
believe that Statement 154 will have a material impact on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Orkand

On July 6, 2004, which was the first business day of our
2005 fiscal year, we acquired The Orkand Corporation
(“Orkand”), a privately-held provider of technical
services and information technology for U.S. Government
agencies, including the Department of State, Department of
Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Health and
Human Services, Department of Energy and the U.S. Postal
Service. This acquisition has been accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the results of
operations of Orkand have been included in the Consolidated
Statement of Income and Cash Flows since the date of
acquisition. The Orkand business is being operated within our

goodwill of $49.7 million, none of which is deductible for
tax purposes, and identifiable intangible assets of
$9.2 million. The identifiable intangible assets include
customer relationships of $8.3 million and non-competition
agreements of $0.9 million and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods of 10 and 5 years. In
addition to the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
noted above, the balance sheet as of the acquisition date also
included $0.2 million of non-current deferred tax assets,
$17.1 million of accounts and notes receivable,
$8.5 million of accounts payables and accrued expenses and
$0.6 million of other liabilities.

Encoda

On November 3, 2004, we acquired Encoda Systems Holdings,
Inc. (“Encoda”), a privately-held, global supplier of
software solutions and services for the broadcast media
industry, with television, radio, cable, satellite and
advertising agency customers around the world. Encoda’s
end-to-end workflow solutions include traffic and billing,
program-scheduling systems, and automation and media asset
management solutions that are complementary to our existing
automation business. This acquisition has been accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the
results of operations of Encoda have been included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income and Cash Flows since the date
of acquisition. Encoda is a wholly-owned subsidiary and is being
operated within our Broadcast Communications segment. The
purchase price of $411.6 million, after giving effect to
post-closing adjustments, is calculated as follows:

resulted in goodwill of $291.2 million, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes; identifiable intangible assets of
$91.0 million; and a $3.8 million write-off of
in-process research and development. The identifiable intangible
assets include developed technology of $42.5 million,
backlog of $31.4 million, customer relationships of
$9.7 million and trade names of $7.4 million and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods between 7
and 10 years. In fiscal 2005 we also recorded a
$4.8 million impairment of capitalized software costs
related to a software product that is sold by our Broadcast
Communications segment and is being displaced by a product
offered by Encoda. In addition to the goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets noted above, the balance sheet as of the
acquisition date also included $7.6 million of non-current
deferred tax liabilities, $16.9 million of accounts and
notes receivable, $30.7 million of accounts payables and
accrued expenses, $21.1 million of advance payments and
unearned income and $14.5 million of other assets.

NOTE 11: CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
Agreement replaces our prior $300 million four-year senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement, dated October 15,
2003. The Credit Agreement provides for the extension of credit
to us in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit
issuances at any time and from time to time during the term of
the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

exceed $500 million (we may request an increase not to
exceed $250 million). The Credit Agreement may be used for
working capital and other general corporate purposes and to
support any commercial paper that we may issue. At our election,
borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest either
at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate. The base
rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the Federal
funds rate plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s
publicly announced prime lending rate. The Credit Agreement
provides that the interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set
at 0.50 percent, will increase or decrease within certain
limits based on changes in the ratings of our senior, unsecured
long-term debt securities. We are also permitted to request
borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set
pursuant to competitive bid procedures or directly negotiated
with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
covenants limiting liens on our assets; limiting certain
mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; limiting certain
sale and leaseback transactions; limiting certain vendor
financing investments; and limiting the use of proceeds for
hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also prohibits our
consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total capital from
being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our consolidated
ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense from being less
than 3.00 to 1.00 for any four-quarter period. The Credit
Agreement contains certain events of default, including payment
defaults; failure to perform or observe terms and covenants;
material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; default
under other indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
$50 million; the occurrence of one or more judgments or
orders for the payment of money in excess of $50 million
that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability
in excess of $50 million; failure to pay debts as they come
due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of control, including if a
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 25 percent
or more of our voting stock. If an event of default occurs the
lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and
declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued
interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. All
amounts borrowed or outstanding under the Credit Agreement are
due and mature on March 31, 2010, unless the commitments
are terminated earlier either at our request or if certain
events of default occur. At July 1, 2005, no borrowings
were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
potential future issuance of up to $500 million of
securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
$15.9 million from various international banks, all of
which was available on July 1, 2005. These lines provide
for borrowings at various interest rates, typically may be
terminated upon notice, may be used on such terms as mutually
agreed to by the banks and us and are reviewed annually for
renewal or modification. We have a short-term commercial paper
program in place, which we may utilize to satisfy short-term
cash requirements. There were no borrowings under the commercial
paper program at July 1, 2005. These lines do not require
compensating balances.

NOTE 12: SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $4.2 million at July 1, 2005 and
$9.4 million at July 2, 2004 consists solely of notes
payable to banks in both years. Bank notes with Brazilian banks
had been repaid as of July 1, 2005, but were
$4.8 million at July 2, 2004 with a weighted-average
interest rate of 17.1 percent. The weighted-average
interest rate for bank notes other than those with Brazilian
banks was 8.5 percent at July 1, 2005 and
4.0 percent at July 2, 2004.

$300.0 million in fiscal 2008; none in fiscal 2009; none in
fiscal 2010; and $100.0 million thereafter. These potential
maturities take into consideration the possibility that the debt
holders will exercise put options for our 3.5% Convertible
Debentures and 6.35% debentures in August 2007 and February
2008, respectively. All of our outstanding long-term debt is
unsubordinated, unsecured with equal ranking.

On August 26, 2002, we completed the private placement of
$150 million of our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due
2022. The debentures are unsecured obligations convertible, in
certain instances, into shares of our common stock at a
conversion price of $22.625 per share, subject to
adjustment. The debentures were issued at 100 percent of the
principal amount, less a discount of 2.5 percent to the
initial purchasers. We may redeem the debentures commencing
August 2007 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus
accrued interest in cash. Holders may require us to repurchase
the debentures, in whole or in part, on specified dates in 2007,
2012 and 2017 or upon the occurrence of certain other events at
100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
The debentures bear interest at an annual rate of
3.5 percent. The interest rate will be reset in August
2007, 2012 and 2017, but in no event will it be reset below
3.5 percent or above 5.5 percent per annum. We
incurred $4.8 million in debt issuance costs related to the
issuance of the convertible debentures, which costs are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period and
reflected as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

NOTE 14: PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, we declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
common stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by common stock share certificates or
book-entry account statements, trade with the common stock until
they become exercisable, and entitle the holder to purchase one
two-hundredth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock for
$62.50, subject to adjustment. The rights are not exercisable
until the earlier of 10 business days (or such later date fixed
by our Board of Directors) after a party commences a tender or
exchange offer to acquire a beneficial interest of at least
15 percent of our outstanding common stock, or the first
date of public announcement by us that a person has acquired a
beneficial interest of at least 15 percent of our
outstanding common stock, or such later date fixed by our
Board of Directors.

Upon the first date of public announcement by us that a person
has acquired a beneficial interest of at least 15 percent
of our outstanding common stock, or such later date fixed by our
Board of Directors, each right (other than rights beneficially
owned by an acquiring person or any affiliate or associate
thereof) would entitle the holder to purchase shares of our
common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price of the right. In addition, each right (other than rights
beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any affiliate or
associate thereof) would entitle the holder to exercise the
right and receive shares of common stock of the acquiring
company, upon a merger or other business combination, having a
market value of twice the exercise price of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights become exercisable,
the Board of Directors may elect to exchange all of the then
outstanding rights for shares of common stock at an exchange
ratio of one share of common stock per right, subject to
adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and may be
redeemed by

the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per right at any
time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial interest of
15 percent of the outstanding common stock.

NOTE 15: STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The following information relates to stock options and incentive
stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent of market value
on the date the options are granted. Options may be exercised
for a period set at the time of grant, which ranges from 7 to
10 years after the date of grant and become exercisable in
installments.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, we use the
intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock option awards
granted to employees and, accordingly, do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
the Consolidated Statement of Income.

We have stock incentive plans for directors and employees.
Awards under these plans may include the grant of performance
shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation
rights or other stock-based awards. Restricted shares
outstanding under our stock incentive plans were 261,666 at
July 1, 2005, 223,332 at July 2, 2004 and 250,000 at
June 27, 2003. Performance shares outstanding under our
stock incentive plan were 505,110 at July 1, 2005, 400,000
at July 2, 2004, and 339,666 at June 27, 2003. Shares
of common stock reserved for future awards under the stock
incentive plans were 11,153,594 at July 1, 2005, 13,188,374
at July 2, 2004, and 15,227,232 at June 27, 2003.

Total compensation expense recognized from restricted and
performance shares during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 was $9.0 million, $5.6 million and
$2.5 million, respectively. The value of restricted stock,
equal to the intrinsic value at the time of grant, is amortized
as compensation expense over the vesting period. The value of
performance shares, equal to the most probable estimate of the
intrinsic value at the time of distribution, is amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period.

Under our domestic retirement plans, most employees may select
an option to invest in Harris’ common stock at
70 percent of current market value limited to the lesser of
(a) one percent of their compensation and (b) 20
percent of a participant’s total contribution to the plan,
which is matched by us. The discount from fair market value on
common stock purchased by employees under the domestic
retirement plans are charged to compensation expense in the
period of the related purchase.

NOTE 16: NET INCOME PER SHARE

The computations of diluted net income per share are as follows:

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million of
3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022. Holders of the
debentures will have the right to convert each of their
debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the stated
maturity of the debentures under any of the following
circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of our
    common stock, for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
    trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
    previous calendar quarter, is more than 110 percent of the
    applicable conversion price per share of our common stock on
    such last trading day,

•

debentures called for redemption may be surrendered for
    conversion until the close of business on the business day
    immediately preceding the redemption date,

•

during any period that the long-term credit rating assigned to
    the debentures by either of Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
    or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group is at or below
    Ba1 or BB+, respectively, or if the debentures no longer are
    rated by either of these ratings services, or if the ratings for
    the debentures have been suspended by either of these ratings
    services, or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions,
    including if we make a significant distribution to holders of
    our common stock or if we are a party to specified
    consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all
    of our properties and assets.

After giving effect to the adjustment in connection with our
recent stock split, a holder will receive 44.2404 shares of
our common stock for each $1,000 of debentures surrendered for
conversion. This represents a conversion price of
$22.625 per share of our common stock based on the issue
price of the debentures. The conversion rate may be adjusted for
certain reasons. Based upon satisfaction of the market price
trigger as of the end of the calendar quarter ended
June 30, 2005, these debentures are convertible into shares
of our common stock during the calendar quarter ended
September 30, 2005.

NOTE 17: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
expensed as incurred. These costs were $137.3 million in
fiscal 2005, $111.3 million in fiscal 2004 and
$99.8 million in fiscal 2003.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred
pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for
principally by the percentage-of-completion method.
Customer-sponsored research and development costs incurred under
U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require us to provide a
product or service meeting certain defined performance or other
specifications (such as designs). Customer-sponsored research
and development was $733.0 million in fiscal 2005,
$729.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $499.9 million in
fiscal 2003. Customer-sponsored research and development is
included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services.

NOTE 18: INTEREST EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $24.0 million in fiscal 2005,
$24.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $24.9 million in
fiscal 2003. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
major long-term projects can be capitalized as an



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

additional cost of the related asset. No interest was
capitalized in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003. Interest
paid was $23.2 million in fiscal 2005, $23.6 million
in fiscal 2004 and $23.7 million in fiscal 2003.

NOTE 19: LEASE COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to $27.0 million in fiscal
2005, $20.7 million in fiscal 2004, and $20.4 million
in fiscal 2003. Future minimum rental commitments under leases
with an initial lease term in excess of one year, primarily for
land and buildings, amounted to approximately
$103.4 million at July 1, 2005. These commitments for
the years following fiscal 2005 are: fiscal 2006 —
$24.0 million; fiscal 2007 — $20.6 million;
fiscal 2008 — $16.6 million; fiscal
2009 — $14.4 million; fiscal 2010 —
$9.1 million; and $18.7 million thereafter.

NOTE 20: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
ACTIVITY

We use foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset
foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments
from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed
sales to customers and intercompany loans. We believe the use of
foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks
that arise from doing business in international markets. At
July 1, 2005, we had open foreign exchange contracts with a
notional amount of $73.3 million, of which
$48.6 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$24.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $93.9 million as of July 2, 2004, of which
$30.0 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$63.9 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
July 1, 2005, contract expiration dates range from less
than one month to 17 months with a weighted average
contract life of 6 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
exposures from cash flows anticipated from the Bowman program in
our RF Communications segment, operating expenses in our
Microwave Communications segment’s Canadian operations and
payments to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of our
government contracts in our Government Communications Systems
segment. The Bowman contract is for our tactical radio products
and was awarded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Under the
contract, the customer pays in Pounds Sterling. We have hedged
the forecasted cash flows related to payments made to our
U.S. operations to maintain our anticipated profit margins.
We also have hedged U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to
maintain our anticipated profit margins in our U.K. operations.
As of July 1, 2005, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
$0.7 million would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income within the next month related to the cash
flow hedges for the Bowman program. As of July 1, 2005, we
estimated that pre-tax income of $0.3 million would be
reclassified into earnings from comprehensive income within the
next 12 months related to the cash flow hedges for the
operating expenses of our Microwave Communications
segment’s Canadian operations. As of July 1, 2005, we
estimated that a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million would be
reclassified into earnings from comprehensive income within the
next 17 months related to the cash flow hedges for payments
to a vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of our government
contracts in our Government Communications Systems segment. No
pretax income or loss would be reclassified into earnings from
comprehensive income over the next 15 months from the other
transactions we are hedging as of July 1, 2005.

The net gain included in our earnings in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. No amounts were
recognized in our earnings in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 related
to the component of the derivative instruments’ gain or
loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In
addition, no amounts were recognized in our earnings in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 related to hedged firm commitments that no
longer qualify as fair value hedges. All of these derivatives
were recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet in
accordance with Statement 133.

The components of deferred income tax assets
(liabilities) are as follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory United States income tax rate
to the effective income tax rate follows:

United States income taxes have not been provided on
$407.2 million of undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest these
earnings. The determination of unrecognized deferred
U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and
credit carryforwards as of July 1, 2005 have expiration
dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
instances. The amount of domestic, international and state and
local tax loss carryforwards as of July 1, 2005 was
$75.6 million, $75.2 million and $63.0 million,
respectively. The provision for income taxes includes benefits
attributable to the utilization of certain state net operating
loss carryforwards of $5.1 million in fiscal 2005 and
$3.7 million in fiscal 2004. Pre-tax income (loss) of
international subsidiaries was $17.9 million in fiscal
2005, $49.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $(23.9) million
in fiscal 2003. Income taxes paid were $43.6 million in
fiscal 2005, $52.7 million in fiscal 2004 and
$23.0 million in fiscal 2003. The valuation allowance
increased $9.0 million from $38.7 million in fiscal
2004 to $47.7 million in fiscal 2005. The valuation
allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes,
to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due
to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the
future.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was
signed into law. The Act includes a one year reduced tax rate on
repatriation of foreign earnings. The range of potential
repatriation is from none to the full $407.2 million
mentioned above. We have not completed our evaluation of the tax
effect of any repatriation under the Act. We expect to complete
our evaluation of the effect of the Act on our earnings during
fiscal 2006.

NOTE 23: BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we serve and
operate in four business segments — Government
Communications Systems, RF Communications, Microwave
Communications and Broadcast Communications. We changed our
segment reporting structure effective May 28, 2004, in
conjunction with the sale of our TTS product line. The TTS
product line was formerly part of the Network Support segment,
which was eliminated as a separate reportable segment as a
result of the sale. Our Government Communications Systems
segment engages in advanced research and develops, designs,
produces and services advanced communication and information
processing systems, primarily to the U.S. Department of
Defense and various other agencies of the U.S. Government.
Our RF Communications segment performs advanced research and
develops, designs, manufactures, sells and services secure
tactical radio products, primarily to the U.S. Department
of Defense and various international defense agencies. Our
Microwave Communications segment designs, manufactures, sells
and services microwave radio products; develops, designs,
produces, sells and services network management systems,
primarily to cellular network providers and private network
users. Our Broadcast Communications segment designs,
manufactures, sells and services television and radio
transmission products; develops, designs, produces, sells and
services software solutions for the broadcast media industry
related to automation, asset management control and workflow;
and designs, manufactures, sells and services broadcast
networking systems and products, primarily to radio and
television broadcasters as well as governmental agencies.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
States with international revenue derived primarily from
exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
exceeded 4 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2005,
fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

The accounting policies of the operating segments are as
described in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies. We
evaluate each segment’s performance based on its
“operating income or loss,” which we define as profit
or loss from operations before income taxes excluding interest
income and expense, equity income, and gains or losses from
securities and other investments. In fiscal 2003, intersegment
sales were transferred at prices comparable to those provided to
unaffiliated customers. In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004,
intersegment sales were transferred at cost to the buying
segment and the sourcing segment recognized a normal profit that
was eliminated. This change in the intersegment policy resulted
in an elimination of intercompany profit, which was
$16.5 million in fiscal 2005 and $7.3 million in
fiscal 2004. The “Corporate eliminations” line item in
the charts below represents the elimination of intersegment
sales and their related profits. “Headquarters
expense” represents the portion of corporate expenses not
allocated to the business segments or discontinued operations.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all segments
(primarily our Government Communications Systems segment and our
RF Communications segment) as a percentage of total revenue were
65.7 percent in fiscal 2005, 65.5 percent in fiscal
2004 and 62.4 percent in fiscal 2003.

Selected information by business segment and geographical area
is summarized below:

Headquarters assets consist primarily of cash, marketable
securities, buildings, equipment, net assets of discontinued
operations and selected investments. Depreciation and
amortization includes identifiable intangible



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

assets and debt issuance costs amortization of
$16.3 million, $3.7 million and $3.2 million in
fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively.

Export revenue was $326.6 million in fiscal 2005,
$308.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $222.7 million in
fiscal 2003. Export revenue and revenue from international
operations was principally from Europe, Africa, the Middle East
and Asia.

NOTE 24: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
of businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
related to: product liability; personal injury; patents,
trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products
containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or environmental
matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded
accruals for losses related to those matters that we consider to
be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred. While it is
not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
information, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
July 1, 2005 are reserved for, covered by insurance or
would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

On August 17, 1998, we filed a patent infringement claim
against Ericsson, Inc. (“Ericsson”) in the
U.S. Federal District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia and on November 5, 1998, the Court transferred the
case to the Northern District of Texas (“District
Court”). On October 29, 2002, a jury rendered a
verdict in our favor against Ericsson and its parent company.
The jury awarded us approximately $61 million in
compensatory damages and found that Ericsson’s conduct was
“willful.” Following the rendering of such verdict, we
filed a motion to enhance the damages based upon the finding of
willfulness, and Ericsson filed motions: (i) to decrease
the damage award, (ii) to order a new trial, and
(iii) for non-infringement and invalidity of the relevant
patent notwithstanding the jury’s verdict. On July 17,
2003, the District Court issued a ruling on these motions
denying Ericsson’s motions for non-infringement and
invalidity of the patent, but ruled that unless we agreed to a
lowered damage award of $43 million in compensatory
damages, it was granting Ericsson’s motion for a new trial
on the issue of damages. We agreed to the lowered damages and
thus, a judgment was entered for us in the amount of
$43 million plus $1 million for enhanced damages and
$1 million for attorneys’ fees, as well as
pre-judgment interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004,
Ericsson appealed the judgment of the District Court to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(“CAFC”). We filed a cross appeal seeking to increase
the amount of enhanced damages. The briefing for the appeal was
completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and oral
arguments were held during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. On
August 5, 2005, the CAFC issued an opinion vacating the
jury’s finding of infringement on one of the four patent
claims; vacating the District Court’s denial of post-trial
briefs by Ericsson; and remanding the case to the District Court
for further proceedings. A dissenting opinion was also
published. On August 19, 2005, we filed a petition for
reconsideration and, in the alternative, a petition for
rehearing by the CAFC. We anticipate a decision on these
petitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

On July 29, 2002, we received a demand letter from Bourdex
Telecommunications Limited (“Bourdex”), a
Nigerian-based customer for a product of our former analog base
station business and related services, alleging (i) breach
of contract, and (ii) deceit based upon misrepresentation.
In accordance with the contract, we submitted an arbitration
request pursuant to the International Chamber of Commerce’s
Procedural Rules asking for a determination that we fully
complied with the contract and that we owed no further duty to
Bourdex. In January 2003, Bourdex restated its demand at
$22.3 million. The arbitration hearing took place beginning
in March 2004 and concluded in July 2004. Based on that hearing,
the parties received a decision from the arbitration panel in
January 2005 indicating that we breached a duty to Bourdex,
based on a special relationship that developed between the
parties. According to the decision, other issues still need to
be considered, subject to further pleadings on the topic of
appropriate remedies, if any. After the January 2005 decision,
Bourdex continued to revise its demands. The current demand is
for approximately $35 million. A hearing on the issue of
remedies and damages is scheduled to be held during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. We intend to continue the vigorous
defense of this claim and consider appropriate appellate relief.
We believe that the potential losses related to this case range
from no liability to the amount of Bourdex’s demand and
accordingly we have not accrued any liability for this item as
of July 1, 2005.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

In August 2005, we began to implement a series of cost-reduction
actions to address international market weakness in our
Broadcast Communications segment. As part of these actions our
European-standard transmitter production will be moved from our
Huntingdon, U.K. facility to our Quincy, Illinois facility.
Also, radio console assembly and related products will be moved
from the Mason, Ohio facility to an outside supplier. Additional
synergies from the Encoda acquisition have also been identified
allowing for further staff reductions. In total, these actions
could result in the elimination of 150 to 200 positions.
Facility closure, relocation expenses, severance costs and other
charges associated with these actions could total approximately
$27 million.

On August 31, 2005, we announced that we entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares of Leitch
Technology Corporation (“Leitch”), a provider of
high-performance video systems for the television broadcast
industry, including routers and distribution equipment, signal
processing, signal management and monitoring, servers and
storage area networks, branding software and post-production
editing systems. Total price consideration, net of cash on hand,
will be approximately $450 million excluding acquisition
costs. The acquisition is to be completed by way of a statutory
plan of arrangement and is subject to approval by Leitch
shareholders, customary regulatory and court approvals, and
other closing conditions. Following the consummation of the
transaction, Leitch will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harris.
The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter
of our 2006 fiscal year. The amount of consideration to the
former shareholders and option holders of Leitch will be paid
out of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents as well as
borrowings under our available credit arrangements. Leitch
reported revenue of approximately $183 million for its
fiscal year ended April 30, 2005. We expect that Leitch
will be operated within our Broadcast Communications segment.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls
and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls
and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily
is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have
investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not
control or manage these entities, our controls and procedures
with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially
more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries. As required by Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2005 we carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer. During fiscal 2005, we devoted
significant effort to comply with the rules on internal control
over financial reporting issued pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This effort expanded upon our
long-standing practice of acknowledging management’s
responsibility for the establishment and effective operation of
internal control through performing self-assessment and
monitoring procedures. Based upon this work and other evaluation
procedures, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that as
of the end of fiscal 2005 our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

During fiscal 2005
we reviewed our internal control over financial reporting as
part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In
addition, we routinely review our system of internal control
over financial reporting to identify potential changes to our
processes and systems that may improve controls and increase
efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective
internal control environment. Changes may include such
activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating the activities of acquired business units,
migrating certain processes to our shared services
organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving
segregation of duties, and adding additional monitoring
controls. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we
incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired
business as part of our integration activities. There have been
no changes (including corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the
quarter ended July 1, 2005 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
