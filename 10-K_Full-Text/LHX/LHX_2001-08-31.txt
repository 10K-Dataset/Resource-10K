but are not limited to, those discussed in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” below.

PART  I

ITEM  1.  BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY

Harris Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is an
international company focused on the worldwide market for voice,
data, and video communications equipment for wireless,
broadcast, network support, and government markets. Harris was
incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to three
companies founded in the 1890’s. The principal executive
offices of Harris Corporation (hereinafter called
“Harris” or the “Company”) are located at
1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919,
and the telephone number is (321) 727-9100.

Recent Development of Business

During fiscal 2001 Harris undertook several acquisitions and
dispositions designed to strengthen its position in the
communications markets.

Acquisition of WavTrace, Inc.

In August 2000, Harris
acquired WavTrace, Inc., a developer of broadband microwave
radio systems for high-speed wireless access to the Internet and
other data, voice, and video services. Prior to the acquisition,
Harris owned slightly less than 20 percent of WavTrace. The
purchase price for the remaining 80 percent was valued at
$144.0 million. For a discussion of WavTrace and its
technology, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below.

Acquisition of Exigent International, Inc.

In
May 2001, Harris acquired Exigent International, Inc., a
provider of professional services and software support to
government agencies for the management of satellite command and
control, telecommunications and information technology programs.
The purchase price was $34.7 million.

Acquisition of Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network
Business

.

In fiscal 2001, Harris entered into
agreements to acquire the Hirschmann Multimedia Communications
Network Business, a leader in European-standard digital video
television and digital audio broadcast radio transmitters and
digital cable systems with annual sales of $26.0 million.
The transaction was completed at the start of the first quarter
of fiscal 2002.

Sale of Joint Venture Interests.

In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001, Harris sold its minority interest in GE-Harris
Railway Electronics to General Electric for $50.0 million.

Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, Harris sold
its minority interest in GE-Harris Energy Controls Systems to
General Electric. This sale and related transactions resulted in
proceeds to Harris of approximately $29.0 million.

During fiscal 2000, Harris completed its repositioning as a
company focused on communications and communications equipment.
During fiscal 2000, Harris completed the spin-off of its Lanier
Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary and the sale of Harris’
semiconductor business and also exited from the telephone
switching and alarm management product lines. As a result of
these actions, Harris’ consolidated financial statements and



notes for prior periods report the Lanier Worldwide, Inc. and
semiconductor businesses as discontinued operations and,
accordingly, prior periods have been restated.

General

Harris structures its operations around two segments:
(1) the Government Communications segment, which is
comprised of the Government Communications Systems Division, and
(2) the Commercial Communications segment, which is
comprised of four divisions. Each of Harris’ five divisions
have been organized on the basis of specific communications
markets. For the most part, each operating division has its own
marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and product service and
maintenance organization. Harris produces most of the products
it sells, except for certain broadcast products sold by the
Broadcast Communications Division, which products are sourced
from a variety of manufacturers. Reference is made to the Note

Business Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements
for further information with respect to business segments.

Total revenues in fiscal 2001 increased to approximately
$1.96 billion from approximately $1.81 billion a year
earlier. Total sales in the United States increased
approximately 5 percent from a year earlier while
international sales, which amounted to approximately
29 percent of the total from continuing operations,
increased approximately 18 percent. Net income from
continuing operations for fiscal 2001 decreased to
$21.4 million from $25.0 million in fiscal 2000.

The markets served and principal products of the Company’s
business segments are as follows:

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment of Harris’
business was $370 million at July 27, 2001,
substantially all of which is expected to be filled during the
2002 fiscal year, compared with approximately $367 million a
year earlier.

Government Communications Segment

The Government Communications segment of Harris is engaged in
advanced research, design, development, and production of
communication, information processing, and electronic products,
services, systems, and sub-systems for government and commercial
organizations in the United States and internationally, and for
Harris’ Commercial Communications segment. The Government
Communications segment specializes in airborne, spaceborne,
shipboard, and ground communications for military and government
agencies and their prime contractors. Applications of the
segment’s state-of-the-art technologies include:

The Government Communications segment is a major supplier of
advanced-technology communications and information processing
systems to the United States Department of Defense, Federal
Aviation Administration, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, and other federal and local government agencies,
and aircraft manufacturers.

Sales in fiscal 2001 for this business segment increased
4 percent to $848.3 million from $815.9 million
in fiscal 2000. Operating income increased 22 percent. This
segment contributed 43 percent of Harris’ total sales
from continuing operations in fiscal 2001, 45 percent in
fiscal 2000, and 47 percent in fiscal 1999.

The Government Communications segment is a leading supplier of
air-traffic control communication systems and is also a major
supplier of custom aircraft and spaceborne communication and
information processing systems, cockpit digital moving maps,
controls and display processors, a leading supplier of
terrestrial and satellite communication systems, including large
deployable satellite antenna systems and flat panel,
phased-array and single-mission antennas, and is a preeminent
supplier of super-high-frequency military satellite ground
terminals for the Department of Defense. The segment is also
diversifying into the commercial satellite business and has been
awarded contracts to provide antennas for commercial programs
such as the Asian Cellular System.

The division is a major supplier of custom ground-based systems
and software designed to collect, store, retrieve, process,
analyze, display, and distribute information for government,
defense, and law enforcement applications, including
meteorological data processing systems and range management
information systems. The segment also provides computer
controlled electronic maintenance, logistic, simulation, and
test systems



for military aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles and provides
sophisticated ground-based and shipboard command, control,
communication, and intelligence systems, products, and services
for many government end-users. The division’s electronic
products enable high-speed communications for platforms such as
the USAF F-22 air superiority fighter and the Army’s
Commanche advanced armed reconnaissance helicopter. The division
is also supplying portions of the communications systems for the
U.S. National Missile Defense program and has won follow-on
awards for the U.S. Army’s Multiple Launch Rocket system
program.

Specific examples of technology developed by the division
include the development of a family of wideband digital links to
support the transmission of radar, imagery, and video from
reconnaissance aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and
satellites and the development of a digital map that
electronically displays real-time terrain, flight paths, and
target locations for fighter helicopters. The division also has
extensive expertise in microelectronics, microelectronic
machines, and advanced wireless tracking technology and is
developing secure wireless LAN products for battlefield
applications and advanced modems for use in high-bandwidth
efficient systems.

While classified projects are not discussed in this report, the
operating results relating to classified projects are included
in Harris’ consolidated financial statements, and the
business risks associated with such projects do not differ
materially from those of other projects for the United States
government.

The Government Communications segment is also expanding its
capabilities and offerings in the government services business.
During fiscal 2001, Harris acquired Exigent International, Inc.,
a provider of professional services and software support to
government agencies for the management of satellite command and
control, telecommunications, and information technology programs.

Harris recently concluded the sale of its minority interest in
two joint ventures with the General Electric Company. Harris
sold its interest in GE-Harris Railway Electronics to General
Electric in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and concluded the
sale of its interest in GE-Harris Energy Controls Systems to
General Electric in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In fiscal
2001, General Electric and Harris also terminated the GE-Harris
Aviation Information Solutions joint venture.

In August 2001, Harris also completed the sale of 90 percent of
its interest in its Harris Publishing Systems and Baseview
Products subsidiaries. The sale price of $8.5 million is
subject to adjustment. These subsidiaries had revenues of
approximately $21 million in fiscal 2001.

Most of the sales of the Government Communications segment are
made directly or indirectly to the United States government
under contracts or subcontracts containing standard government
contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if
applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the
government or for default of the contractor. These sales consist
of a variety of contracts and programs with various governmental
agencies, with no single program accounting for 10 percent
or more of total Harris sales. The segments contracts and
backlog include both cost reimbursement and fixed priced
contracts.

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment of Harris’
business was $405 million at July 27, 2001, a
substantial portion of which is expected to be filled during the
2002 fiscal year, compared with $360 million a year earlier.

International Business

Revenues in fiscal 2001 from products exported from the United
States or manufactured abroad were $572.8 million or
29 percent of the Company’s total sales, compared with
$487.3 million or 27 percent of the Company’s
total sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2000 and
$448.5 million or 26 percent in fiscal 1999. The
Company’s international sales include both direct exports
from the United States and sales from foreign subsidiaries. Most
of the international sales are derived from the Commercial
Communications segment. Direct export sales are primarily
denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from foreign
subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of
the subsidiary. Exports from the United States, principally
to Europe, Latin America, and Asia, totaled $227.1 million
or 40 percent of the international sales in fiscal 2001,
$229.7 million or 47 percent of the international
sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2000 and
$242.2 million or 54 percent of the international sales
from continuing operations in fiscal 1999.



Foreign operations represented 18 percent of revenues and
12 percent of long-lived assets as of June 29, 2001.
Government communication systems are produced principally in the
United States. International revenues are derived primarily
from exports. International manufacturing facilities for
commercial products are located in Brazil, Canada, China, and
the United Kingdom.

International marketing activities are conducted through
subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
America, and Asia. Harris has also established an international
marketing organization and several regional sales offices.
Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
Registrant” for further information regarding foreign
subsidiaries.

Harris utilizes indirect sales channels, including dealers,
distributors, and sales representatives, in the marketing and
sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
governmental customers for direct sales by Harris. Prices to the
ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
established by the independent representative and may be on a
basis which is above or below the Company’s list prices.
These independent representatives generally receive a discount
from the Company’s list prices and may mark-up those prices
in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. During
the 2001 fiscal year, sales from indirect sales channels
represented 9 percent of Harris’ total sales and
27 percent of Harris’ international sales.

Fiscal year 2001 orders came from a large number of foreign
countries, no one of which accounted for five percent or
more of the Company’s total orders.

Certain of Harris’ exports are paid for by letters of
credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or
installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments, or
other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often
cover most of the related costs incurred. Performance guarantees
by the Company are generally required on significant foreign
government contracts. In order to stay competitive in
international markets, the Company also enters into recourse and
vendor financing to facilitate sales to certain customers.

The particular economic, social, and political conditions for
business conducted outside the United States differ from those
encountered by domestic businesses. Management believes that the
overall business risk for the international business as a whole
is somewhat greater than that faced by its domestic operations
as a whole. International business may subject the Company to
risks such as:

Nevertheless, in the opinion of management, these risks are
offset by the diversification of the international business and
the protection provided by letters of credit and advance
payments.

Except for inconsequential matters, such as matters involving
road and utility rights-of-way, Harris has never been subjected
to threat of government expropriation, either within the United
States or abroad.

Financial information regarding the Company’s domestic and
international operations is contained in the Note

Business
Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Competition

Harris operates in highly competitive businesses that are
sensitive to technological advances. Although successful product
and systems development is not necessarily dependent on
substantial financial resources, some of Harris’
competitors in each of its businesses are larger and can
maintain higher levels of expenditures



for research and development than Harris. Harris’
competitors in the Commercial Communications segment include
large multinational communications companies, as well as smaller
companies with developing technology expertise. Harris’
competition for U.S. government contracts typically are
large, technically competent firms with substantial assets.
Harris concentrates in each of its businesses on the market
opportunities which management believes are compatible with its
resources, overall technological capabilities, and objectives.
Principal competitive factors in these businesses are
cost-effectiveness, product quality and reliability,
technological capabilities, service, ability to meet delivery
schedules, and the effectiveness of dealers in international
areas.

Principal Customers

Sales to the U.S. government, which is the Company’s only
customer accounting for 10 percent or more of total sales,
were 42 percent, 41 percent and 42 percent of the
Company’s total sales from continuing operations in fiscal
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. All U.S. government
contracts are terminable at the convenience of the U.S.
government, as well as for default. Under contracts terminable
at the convenience of the U.S. government, a contractor is
entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in
general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the
work done. Contracts which are terminable for default generally
provide that the U.S. government only pays for the work it has
accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the
incremental cost of reprocurement and may hold the contractor
liable for damages.

Companies engaged in supplying goods and services to the U.S.
government are dependent on congressional appropriations and
administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes
in U.S. government policies resulting from various military and
political developments. In many cases, there is also additional
uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for
design improvements, and difficulty in forecasting costs and
schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated
technical work. For further discussion of risks relating to U.S.
government contracts see “Legal Proceedings.” It is
not expected that changes to the Department of Defense budget
will have a material effect on the profitability of Harris in
fiscal 2002.

Backlog

Harris’ backlog of unfilled orders from continuing
operations was approximately:

•

$775 million at July 27, 2001,

•

$727 million at July 31, 2000, and

•

$786 million at July 31, 1999.

Substantially all of the backlog orders at July 27, 2001
are expected to be filled during fiscal 2002. The determination
of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with
respect to customer requirements contracts and long-term
contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

Research, Development, and Engineering

Research, development, and engineering expenditures by Harris
for its continuing operations totaled approximately:

•

$486 million in fiscal 2001,

•

$480 million in fiscal 2000, and

•

$500 million in fiscal 1999.

Company-sponsored research and product development costs for its
continuing operations were approximately:

•

$114 million in fiscal 2001,

•

$100 million in fiscal 2000, and

•

$92 million in fiscal 1999.

The portion of total research, development, and engineering
expenditures not Company-sponsored was funded by government and
commercial customers. Company-funded research is directed to the
development



of new products and to building technological capability in
selected communications and electronic systems areas.
Government-funded research helps strengthen and broaden the
technical capabilities of Harris in its areas of interest.
Almost all of the operating divisions maintain their own
engineering and new product development departments, with
scientific assistance provided by advanced-technology
departments.

Harris currently employs about 4,000 engineers and scientists
and is making efforts to make the technologies developed in any
of our divisions available for all other divisions.

Patents and Intellectual Property

Harris holds numerous patents which it considers, in the
aggregate, to constitute an important asset. However, Harris
does not consider its business or any business segment to be
materially dependent upon any single patent or any group of
related patents. Harris is engaged in a pro-active patent
licensing program, especially in the Commercial Communications
segment, and has entered into a number of unilateral license and
cross-license agreements, many of which generate royalty income.
Although existing license agreements have generated income in
past years and will do so in the future, there can be no
assurances Harris will enter into additional income producing
license agreements. With regard to patents relating to the
Government Communications segment, the U.S. government often has
an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to
which the government may use or authorize others to use the
inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar
arrangements, the government may consent to Harris’ use of
inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.

Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with Harris
products are considered to be a valuable asset of Harris.

Environmental and Other Regulations

The manufacturing facilities of Harris, in common with those of
industry generally, are subject to numerous laws and regulations
designed to protect the environment, particularly with regard to
wastes and emissions. Harris believes that it has materially
complied with these requirements and that such compliance has
not had a material adverse effect on its business or financial
condition. Expenditures to protect the environment and to comply
with current environmental laws and regulations over the next
several years are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s competitive or financial position. If future laws
and regulations contain more stringent requirements than
presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than
the Company’s present estimates of those expenditures.

Waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment have
been installed to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve the
Company’s waste minimization and prevention goals. An
estimated $0.1 million was spent on environmental capital
projects in each of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, and
$0.3 million was spent in fiscal 1999. A significant
portion of these expenditures related to discontinued
operations; however, the Company has retained certain
environmental liabilities with respect to some of its
discontinued operations. The Company currently forecasts
authorization for environmental-related capital projects
totaling $0.1 million in fiscal 2002. These amounts may
increase in future years.

Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
forth in “Legal Proceedings” and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Because of the diversity of the Company’s products and
services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its
facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide array
of raw materials needed for its operations and for products that
it sells. The Company is dependent upon suppliers and
subcontractors for a large number of components and the ability
of its suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and
quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some
instances, the Company is dependent upon one or a few sources,
either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or
because of domestic preference requirements pursuant to which it
operates on a given project. To date, the Company has not been
materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
materials or products.



Employees

As of June 29, 2001, Harris had approximately
10,100 employees, of whom approximately 8,800 were located
in the United States. Approximately 4,000 employees were
employed in the Commercial Communications segment and 5,400 were
employed in the Government Communications segment, with the
remainder employed in headquarters or other support or service
functions. In general, Harris believes that its relations with
its employees are good.

ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES.

Harris operates approximately 18 plants and approximately
55 offices in the United States, Canada, Europe, Central
and South America, and Asia, consisting of about
3.9 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
warehousing, engineering, and office facilities that are owned
and about 1.2 million square feet of sales, office, and
manufacturing facilities that are leased. The leased facilities
are for the most part occupied under leases for terms ranging
from one year to 30 years, a majority of which can be terminated
or renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at Harris’
option. The Company’s corporate headquarters are owned and
located in Melbourne, Florida. The location of the principal
manufacturing plants owned by the Company in the United States,
and the business segments which utilize such plants are as
follows: Government Communications segment — Malabar,
Melbourne, and Palm Bay, Florida; and Commercial Communications
segment — Camarillo, Redwood Shores, and Sunnyvale,
California; Quincy, Illinois; Littleton, Massachusetts;
Cincinnati, Ohio; San Antonio, Texas; and Rochester,
New York. The Commercial Communications segment also has
principal manufacturing plants that are owned by Harris and
located outside the United States, including plants in
Sao Paulo, Brazil; Montreal, Canada; and Cambridge, U.K.

In the opinion of management, Harris’ facilities are
suitable and adequate for their intended purposes and have
capacities adequate for current and projected needs. Unused or
under-utilized facilities are not considered significant.

As of June 29, 2001, the following facilities were in
productive use by Harris in its operations:

ITEM  3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
of business in which the Company is engaged, various claims or
charges are asserted and litigation commenced against the
Company arising from or related to: product liability; patents,
trademarks, or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
breach of warranty; antitrust; distribution; or contractual
relations. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear
any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the
extent of any real risk of court awards. While it is not
feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty,
in the opinion of management, settlements and final judgments,
if any, which might be rendered against the Company in existing
litigation are reserved against, covered by insurance, or would
not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
the business of the Company as a whole.

Government contractors, such as the Company, engaged in
supplying goods and services to the U.S. government and its
various agencies are dependent on congressional appropriations
and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by
changes in U.S. government policies. U.S. government contracts
typically involve long lead times for design and development and
are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the government.
Often these contracts call for



successful design and production of complex and technologically
advanced products or systems. The Company may participate in
supplying goods and services to the U.S. government as either a
prime contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor.
Disputes may arise between the prime contractor and the
government and the prime contractor and its subcontractors and
may result in litigation between the contracting parties.

From time to time, the Company, either individually or in
conjunction with other U.S. government contractors, may be the
subject of U.S. government investigations for alleged criminal
or civil violations of procurement or other federal laws. These
investigations may be conducted without the Company’s
knowledge. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of such
investigations or to estimate the amounts of resulting claims or
other actions that could be instituted against it, its officers
or employees. Under present government procurement regulations,
if indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement or other
federal civil laws a contractor, such as the Company, or one or
more of its operating divisions, could be suspended or debarred
from eligibility for awards of new government contracts for up
to three years. In addition, a government contractor’s
foreign export control licenses could be suspended or revoked.
As an international company, Harris is, from time to time, the
subject of investigations relating to its international
operations, including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and similar laws. The Company is currently cooperating with
certain government representatives in investigations relating to
potential violations of federal procurement, foreign corrupt
practices and other laws. Management does not believe that the
outcome of these current disputes or investigations will have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or the
business of the Company as a whole.

In addition, the Company is subject to numerous federal and
state environmental laws and regulatory requirements and is
involved from time to time in investigations or litigation of
various potential environmental issues concerning ongoing
activities at its facilities or remediation as a result of past
activities. The Company from time to time receives notices from
the United States Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent
state environmental agencies that it is a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly
known as the “Superfund Act”) and/or equivalent state
legislation. Such notices assert potential liability for cleanup
costs at various sites, which include Company-owned sites,
previously owned sites, and non-Company owned treatment or
disposal sites, allegedly containing hazardous substances
attributable to the Company from past operations. The Company
has been named as a PRP at twelve such sites, excluding sites as
to which the Company’s records disclose no involvement or
as to which the Company’s liability has been finally
determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of
many of these proceedings, in the opinion of management, any
payments the Company may be required to make as a result of
currently existing claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or the business of the Company
as a whole.

Additional information regarding environmental matters is set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

ITEM  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF
SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders of
Harris during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.



EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT (As of August 31,
2001).





There is no family relationship between any of the
Company’s executive officers or directors, and there are no
arrangements or understandings between any of the Company’s
executive officers or directors and any other person pursuant to
which any of them was elected as an officer or director, other
than arrangements or understandings with directors or officers
of the Company acting solely in their capacities as such.

All of the Company’s executive officers are elected
annually and serve at the pleasure of the board of directors.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
        STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

Harris Corporation Common Stock, par value $1 per share, is
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(“NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “HRS,” and
is also traded on the Boston, Chicago, Pacific and Philadelphia
Stock Exchanges and through the Intermarket Trading System. As
of August 24, 2001, there were approximately
9,220 holders of record of the Common Stock.

The high and low sales prices as reported in the consolidated
transaction reporting system and the dividends paid on the
Common Stock for each quarterly period in the last two fiscal
years are reported below:

On August 24, 2001, the last sale price of the Harris
Common Stock as reported in the consolidated transaction
reporting system was $29.80 per share.

On August 25, 2001, the board declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.05 per share, which will be paid on
September 21, 2001 to holders of record on
September 7, 2001. The Company has paid cash dividends
every year since 1941 and currently expects that cash dividends
will continue to be paid in the future; however, there can be no
assurances that this will be the case. Following the spin-off of
Lanier Worldwide, Inc. in November 1999, Harris reduced its
annual dividend rate from $0.96 per share to its current annual
level of $0.20 per share. The declaration of dividends and the
amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including
Harris’ financial condition, capital requirements, results
of operations, future business prospects and other factors the
board of directors may deem relevant.

On October 22, 1999, the board authorized the Company to
repurchase up to 15 million shares of its Common Stock
periodically in the open-market, in negotiated or block
transactions or pursuant to tender offers. During fiscal year
2001, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million of
its shares in open-market transactions. In fiscal year 2000, the
Company repurchased approximately 10.7 million of its
shares in open-market transactions. Harris has a remaining
authorization to purchase an additional 1.7 million shares
under its repurchase program.

On August 23, 1997, the board of directors of Harris
approved a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record at
the close of business on September 4, 1997. All share
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been
restated to reflect the stock split.



ITEM  6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The following table summarizes selected historical financial
information of Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries for each
of the last five fiscal years. All amounts presented have been
restated on a continuing operations basis. Discontinued
operations and the restructuring charges are more fully
discussed in the Notes to Financial Statements. The selected
financial information shown below has been derived from
Harris’ audited consolidated financial statements. This
table should be read in conjunction with other financial
information of Harris, including “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and the financial statements included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



ITEM  7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis provides information that
management believes is useful in understanding Harris’
operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The
discussion is based on Harris’ continuing operations and
should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements
and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Except for the historical information contained
here, the discussions in this document contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Harris’
actual results could differ materially from those discussed
here. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed under
“Forward-Looking Statements” below.

Results of Operations

On November 5, 1999, Harris completed the spin-off of its
Lanier Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an independent, publicly
owned company. Additionally, on August 13, 1999, Harris
completed the sale of substantially all of its semiconductor
business. As a result of these actions, the Lanier and
semiconductor businesses are presented as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. Continuing operations are
reported under two segments: the Government Communications
segment and the Commercial Communications segment. The following
discussion is on a continuing operations basis.

Fiscal 2001 Compared with Fiscal 2000

Revenue and Operating Income by Segment

Net revenue for fiscal 2001 was $1,955.1 million, an
increase of 8.2 percent compared to the prior year. Operating
income in fiscal 2001 was $93.9 million versus
$36.3 million for the prior year.

Segment revenue and operating income were as follows:

(1)

Fiscal 2001 includes a $73.5 million write-off of purchased
	in-process research and development. Fiscal 2000 includes a $41
	million restructuring expense and a $10.7 million write-off
	of purchased in-process research and development.

(2)

Fiscal 2001 includes a $33.4 million gain from the sale of
	Harris’ minority interest in its GE-Harris Railway
	Electronics, LLC joint venture and a $20.1 million
	write-down of marketable securities.

Government Communications Segment:

Government
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2001 increased
4.0 percent from the prior year and operating income
increased 22.0 percent as Harris had outstanding technical
and management performance on defense and other government
contracts that resulted



in favorable award fees. Backlog continued to build reflecting a
continued stream of significant contract wins and increased
defense spending by the federal government.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Harris concluded its
acquisition of Exigent International, Inc., a provider of
software and services for satellite command and control,
telecommunications, and information technology.

Commercial Communications Segment:

Commercial
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2001 increased
11.6 percent over fiscal 2000. Excluding sales from the
telephone switching product line that was exited in fiscal 2000,
the Commercial Communications segment’s sales increased
from $918.0 million to $1,106.8 million or
20.6 percent. This segment experienced significant sales
growth in its microwave communications and broadcast
communications markets of 39 percent and 31 percent,
respectively, over the prior fiscal year. These revenue
increases were partially offset by a decline of 11 percent
for the segment’s network support products.

The segment’s operating loss for fiscal 2001 included a
$73.5 million write-off of purchased in-process research and
development related to the acquisition of WavTrace, Inc. and
goodwill amortization of $22.2 million. The segment’s
operating loss for fiscal 2000 included a $41.0 million
restructuring charge, a $10.7 million purchased in-process
research and development write-off related to its Louth
acquisition, goodwill amortization of $10.5 million, and
$47.4 million of losses and write-downs related to the
exited telephone switching and alarm management product lines.

Excluding the items mentioned above in both fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000, the Commercial Communications segment’s
operating income increased from $76.3 million in fiscal
2000 to $81.6 million in fiscal 2001, or 6.9 percent.
The increase in operating income was driven mainly by improved
margins and sales growth in its broadcast communications
business. The segment also experienced modest margin
improvements in its tactical radio and microwave communications
businesses, which was partially offset by poor performance in
the segment’s network support business.

The segment reported a 31 percent increase in revenues for
its broadcast communication products as the transition to
digital technology and the sale of digital television
transmitters gained pace during fiscal 2001. This acceleration
was boosted in part by positive rulings from the FCC affirming
the mandated transition to digital technology. The broadcast
communications business has also become a leading supplier of
studio and automation solutions in the U.S. with the help of the
Louth acquisition made in fiscal 2000.

Following the close of fiscal 2001, Harris acquired the
Hirschmann Multimedia Communications Network business, an
Austrian-based leader in European-standard digital television
and radio transmitters, and digital cable systems with annual
sales of approximately $26 million.

Revenues increased 39 percent for microwave communications
products during fiscal 2001 as markets strengthened in North
America and demand remained high for digital microwave radios
used in cellular, PCS, and private telecom infrastructure
systems. Harris is a leading provider of point-to-point
microwave products and its Megastar™ and
Constellation™ family of products exhibited strong customer
acceptance.

In August 2000, Harris completed the acquisition of WavTrace, a
developer of broadband wireless access (“BWA”) systems
for high-speed wireless access to the Internet and other data,
voice, and video services. The microwave communications business
invested in BWA technology during the year on its
ClearBurst™ GB product. In addition, Harris is planning
further cost reduction actions in our Microwave Communications
business to improve margins and to better position the business
for the expected resumption in market growth. These actions will
include a facility closing and headcount reductions in several
locations and will result in a one-time charge of approximately
$10.0 million in fiscal 2002.

The revenue from tactical radio products increased
2 percent in fiscal 2001 versus record revenue levels in
fiscal 2000. This business continues to benefit from the
market’s enthusiasm for its Falcon II™ high data rate,
multiband, secure radios that were introduced in fiscal 2000 to
meet the growing bandwidth requirement in the networked digital
on-the-move battlefield being embraced by military groups in
both the U.S. and internationally.



Demand for the segment’s network support products declined
11 percent during fiscal 2001 when compared to the prior
year. This market was impacted by the abrupt slowdown in the
domestic DSL services market. Harris has taken actions to reduce
costs in the line test business and began to concentrate more on
its core business of tools and network management products.

Comparative Statement of Income

Harris’ comparative statement of income is as follows:

Gross Margin:

Gross margin as a percent of revenue was
26.8 percent in fiscal 2001 compared to 25.2 percent in
fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2000 gross margin was impacted by a
$12.0 million write-down of inventory and lower gross
margins related to the telephone switching product line that was
exited in fiscal 2000. Excluding the impact of this exited
product line, gross margin as a percent of revenue was
26.2 percent in fiscal 2000. The increase from
26.2 percent gross margin in fiscal 2000 to
26.8 percent gross margin in fiscal 2001 is primarily due
to improved gross margins in the Commercial Communication
segment’s broadcast and tactical radio products as well as
in the Government Communications segment.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses:

Engineering, selling, and administrative expenses as a
percent of revenue were 21.2 percent in fiscal 2001 versus
22.4 percent in fiscal 2000. Engineering, selling, and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2000 were impacted by
$16.5 million of transition costs associated with exiting
the telephone switching product line and by administrative and
general, marketing and sales, and research and development
expenses in the telephone switching product line in the first
half of fiscal 2000. Excluding the impact of the exited product
line, engineering, selling, and administrative expenses as a
percent of revenue were 20.6 percent in fiscal 2000. The
increase from 20.6 percent in fiscal 2000 to 21.2 percent
in fiscal 2001 was due to increased spending in research and
development related to the ClearBurst™ GB microwave radio
product in fiscal 2001.

Goodwill Amortization:

Goodwill amortization increased
from $10.5 million in fiscal 2000 to $22.2 million in
fiscal 2001. The increase was due to the WavTrace acquisition
made in fiscal 2001 and the Louth and TRT Lucent Technologies
acquisitions made during the second half of fiscal 2000.
Intangibles resulting from acquisitions are being amortized by
the straight-line method principally over 8 to 15 years. In
establishing the amortization period of intangibles resulting
from acquisitions Harris considered such factors as future
expected cash flows, technological life spans, customer
relationships, and distribution channels. Harris



continues to monitor these factors and believes that no material
portion of its intangibles resulting from acquisitions will
dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization period
being used.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“Statement 142”). Under Statement 142,
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer
amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with
no maximum life). Harris will apply the new rules on accounting
for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2002. Application of the nonamortization
provisions of Statement 142 is expected to result in an increase
in net income of $15.6 million ($0.24 per diluted share)
per year. During fiscal 2002, Harris will perform the first of
the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets as of July 1, 2001, and has not yet
determined what the effect of these tests will be on
Harris’ operations or financial position.

Other Income (net):

Other income increased from
$48.2 million in fiscal 2000 to $80.0 million in
fiscal 2001. Other income in fiscal 2001 includes a
$33.4 million gain from the sale of Harris’ minority
interest in its GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture
which is partially offset by a $20.1 million write-down of
marketable securities available for sale due to a decline in
market value. The remaining increase in other income is
primarily a result of gains from the sale of shares in Intersil
Holding Corporation which were acquired in August 1999 in
connection with the sale of Harris’ semiconductor
operations. These gains were partially offset by investments
made in marketing and technology products and lower levels of
royalty income in fiscal 2001 when compared to the prior year.

Interest Income and Interest Expense:

Interest income
decreased from $27.4 million in fiscal 2000 to
$13.3 million in fiscal 2001 due to reduced cash balances
that resulted from cash paid for acquired businesses and the
repurchase of Common Stock during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001.
Interest expense increased from $25.2 million in 2000 to
$34.8 million in fiscal 2001 due to an allocation of
interest expense to the results of discontinued operation in
fiscal 2000. Total interest expense from both continuing and
discontinued operations in fiscal 2000 was $41.7 million
versus $34.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease was
largely due to a reduction of total debt from
$491.0 million at June 30, 2000 to $419.4 million
at June 29, 2001.

Income Taxes:

The provision for income taxes as a
percentage of pretax income was 70.4 percent in fiscal 2001
versus 35.0 percent in the prior year. The increase is a
result of the non-deductibility of the write-off of purchased
in-process research and development. Excluding the impact of the
write-off of purchased in-process research and development, the
provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was
35.0 percent in fiscal 2001. Both fiscal 2001 and 2000
benefited from tax rates on foreign source income and export
sales, which offset the additional provision needed for state
income taxes. Fiscal 2001 also benefited from stock sales that
had a higher tax basis than the basis used in calculating gains
for financial accounting purposes.

Return on Revenue:

Income from continuing operations as a
percentage of revenue was 1.1 percent in fiscal 2001 versus 1.4
percent in fiscal 2000. The reduction was primarily due to the
reasons previously discussed.

Selected financial information relating to geographical regions
and export sales is set forth in the Note

Business
Segments

in the Notes to Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2000 Compared with Fiscal 1999

Revenue and Operating Income by Segment

Revenue for fiscal 2000 was $1,807.4 million, an increase
of 3.7 percent compared to the prior year. Operating income in
fiscal 2000 was $36.3 million versus $74.5 million for
the prior year.



Segment revenue and operating income were as follows:

(1)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $41 million restructuring expense
	and a $10.7 million write-off of purchased in-process
	research and development. Fiscal 1999 includes a
	$20.6 million special charge for a litigation settlement.

(2)

Fiscal 1999 includes a $5.1 million restructuring expense.

(3)

Fiscal 2000 includes a $21.9 million gain from the sale of
	Intersil Holding Corporation stock.

Government Communications Segment:

Government
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2000 increased
0.3 percent from the prior year and operating income
increased 11.5 percent. These results were impacted by an
$18.0 million write-off in fiscal 1999 for the settlement
of claims and unrecoverable contract development costs on two
contracts. Excluding this write-off, revenues declined
1.0 percent and operating income declined 17.1 percent
from fiscal 1999. Despite improved operating margins on more
recent contract wins in fiscal 2000, operating income has been
impacted by margin pressure from poorer-performing older
contracts. Revenue growth and operating income improved
significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the third
quarter of fiscal 2000. Backlog continued to build, reflecting a
robust win rate percentage and increased spending by the U.S.
government for defense.

Commercial Communications Segment:

Commercial
Communications segment revenue in fiscal 2000 increased
6.6 percent over fiscal 1999. Excluding sales from the
recently exited telephone switching product line, the Commercial
Communications segment’s sales increased from
$803.7 million to $918.0 million or 14.2 percent.
This segment experienced double-digit growth in all four of the
segment’s major continuing commercial product lines:
microwave, network support, broadcast, and tactical radio. These
revenue increases were partially offset by a 41.9 percent
decrease in revenue from the recently exited telephone switching
and alarm management product lines.

The segment’s operating loss for fiscal 2000 was impacted
by the $41.0 million restructuring charge and the
$10.7 million purchased in-process research and development
write-off mentioned previously, as well as a $12.0 million
write-down of inventory related to the telephone switching and
alarm management product lines that were exited. These product
lines also incurred an additional $18.9 million in
operating losses in fiscal 2000 compared to a loss of
$3.6 million in fiscal 1999. The segment’s fiscal 2000
operating loss also includes transition costs of
$16.5 million associated with exiting these product lines.
Such costs included relocation of the network support business
unit’s headquarters from Marin County, California to
Melbourne, Florida; collection losses on accounts receivable;
and excess manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in Marin
County. Harris ceased all marketing, sales, and research and
development for the telephone switching and alarm management
product lines as of February 2000. The operating losses through
February 2000 included a significant amount of marketing and
sales expenses as well as research and development costs in the
telephone switching product line.



Excluding the items mentioned above in both the current and
prior year, as well as a $20.6 million special charge for a
patent litigation settlement in the prior year, the Commercial
Communications segment’s operating income increased from
$58.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $65.8 million in
fiscal 2000, or 12.9 percent. The increase in operating
income was driven mainly by the 14.2 percent sales growth
in the Commercial Communications segment’s continuing
commercial product lines.

Orders and revenues increased for microwave radios during the
year as markets continued to rebound in North America, Latin
America, and China. In June 2000, Harris completed the
acquisition of the point-to-point microwave business of TRT
Lucent Technologies. The acquisition provides for a five-year
preferred supplier agreement to serve the worldwide
point-to-point microwave needs of Lucent’s wireless
divisions.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, Harris also completed the
acquisition of WavTrace, Inc., a privately-held, leading
developer of broadband wireless access systems. The acquisition
supports Harris’ initiative to lead the world in the
delivery of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint broadband
wireless access solutions for microwave and millimeter wave
frequencies.

The broadcast communications business reported a strong increase
in revenues due primarily to its new studio automation business,
which was bolstered by the purchase of Louth Automation, the
leading supplier of advanced automation systems for digital
television, over-the-air broadcast, and cable and industrial
applications. The acquisition of Louth Automation brings
competencies in automation and control to complement
Harris’ leadership position in broadcast transmission and
digital encoding. This acquisition further broadens Harris’
global position in the broadcast markets.

The tactical radio product line experienced a significant
increase in sales as it continues to benefit from the
market’s enthusiasm for its high data rate, multiband,
secure radios, which were introduced in fiscal 2000 to meet the
growing bandwidth requirement as the digital technology is
embraced by the military.

Orders and revenues also increased substantially for the network
support business. This increase was aided by increased demand
for the telecom line test systems used by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLEC’s) to deploy digital subscriber
lines (DSLs) for applications such as high-speed Internet
service and the other broadband communication services for
voice, data, and video.



Comparative Statement of Income

Harris’ comparative statement of income is as follows:

Gross Margin:

The gross margin as a percent of revenue
was 25.2 percent in fiscal 2000 compared to 26.7 percent in
fiscal 1999. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to a
$12.0 million write-down of inventory and lower gross
margin related to the telephone switching product line that was
exited.

Excluding the impact of this exited product line, gross margin
as a percent of revenue was 26.2 percent in fiscal 2000
compared to 25.8 percent in fiscal 1999. The increase is due to
improved gross margins in Harris’ Commercial Communication
segment’s broadcast, network support, and microwave radio
product lines.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses:

Engineering, selling, and administrative expenses as a
percent of revenue were 22.4 percent in fiscal 2000 versus
21.8 percent in fiscal 1999. Fiscal 2000 operating expenses
were impacted by $16.5 million of transition costs
associated with exiting the telephone switching product line.
Such costs include relocation of the network support business
unit’s headquarters from Marin County, California to
Melbourne, Florida; collection losses on accounts receivable;
and excess manufacturing costs related to idle capacity in Marin
County. The operating expenses were also impacted by
administrative and general, marketing and sales, and research
and development expenses in the telephone switching product line
in the first half of the fiscal year.

Excluding the impact of the exited product line, operating
expenses as a percent of revenue were 20.6 percent in
fiscal 2000 versus 20.3 percent in fiscal 1999. The increase was
primarily due to planned increases in selling and engineering,
research and development expenses, as well as increased
headquarters expenses. The increased headquarters expenses were
primarily attributable to unusually low executive compensation
in fiscal 1999 and costs associated with the centralization of
company-wide shared services in fiscal 2000.

Goodwill Amortization:

Goodwill amortization increased
from $4.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $10.5 million in fiscal
2000. The increase was due to acquisitions made in Harris’
broadcast systems product line during fiscal 2000, primarily the
acquisition of Louth Automation.

Other Income (net):

Other income increased from
$19.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $48.2 million in
fiscal 2000 due primarily to a $21.9 million gain from the sale
of one million shares of Intersil Holding Corporation



stock as a part of Intersil Holding Corporation’s initial
public offering. The remaining increase was due to gains on the
sale and redemption of other securities partially offset by
lower income from Harris’ equity investments.

Interest Income and Interest Expense:

Interest income
increased from $13.3 million in fiscal 1999 to
$27.4 million in fiscal 2000 due to higher cash balances
that resulted from the sale of the semiconductor business and
the spin-off of Lanier Worldwide, Inc. Interest expense
increased from $9.8 million in fiscal 1999 to
$25.2 million in fiscal 2000 due to a higher allocation of
interest expense to the results of discontinued operations in
the prior year. Total interest expense from both continuing
operations and discontinued operations decreased from
$84.0 million in fiscal 1999 to $41.7 million in
fiscal 2000. This decrease is due to the repayment of short-term
debt with the cash received from the sale of the semiconductor
business and the spin-off of Lanier Worldwide, Inc., and lower
interest rates.

Income Taxes:

The provision for income taxes as a
percentage of pretax income was 35.0 percent in fiscal 2000
versus 36.0 percent in the prior year. Both fiscal 2000 and
fiscal 1999 benefited from tax rates on foreign source income
and export sales, which offset the additional provision needed
for state income taxes.

Return on Revenue:

Income from continuing operations as a
percentage of revenue was 1.4 percent in fiscal 2000 versus
2.9 percent in fiscal 1999. The reduction was primarily due
to restructuring expenses, purchased in-process research and
development, and the transition costs and operating losses of
exited product lines which were partially offset by the gain
from sales of Intersil Holding Corporation stock. Excluding
these items, income from continuing operations as a percentage
of revenue increased from 4.2 percent in fiscal 1999 to
4.3 percent in fiscal 2000.

Liquidity and Financial Position

Harris’ comparative financial position at the end of fiscal
2001 and fiscal 2000 is as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents:

Harris had several
transactions that resulted in significant cash uses during
fiscal 2001 including $147.6 million of cash paid for
acquisitions, $83.7 million reduction in debt, and
$92.2 million of cash used to repurchase Harris’
Common Stock. Harris plans to use its remaining cash balances
for similar general corporate purposes in the future including
marketing and technology projects, acquisitions, and repurchases
of its Common Stock.

Marketable securities:

Marketable securities decreased
from $432.5 million at June 30, 2000 to $146.8 million
at June 29, 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the
reduction of quoted market prices for



Harris’ holdings in Intersil Holding Corporation and AirNet
Communications Corporation as well as the sales of
$127.4 million worth of marketable securities during fiscal
2001.

Credit arrangements:

Harris has available syndicated
credit facilities with various banks that provide for borrowings
up to $400 million. The credit facilities consist of a
3-Year Credit Agreement which expires in May of 2004 and a
364-Day Credit Agreement that expires in May of 2002. Interest
rates on borrowings under these facilities and related fees are
determined by a pricing matrix based upon Harris’ long-term
debt rating assigned by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group
and Moody’s Investors Service. Harris is not required to
maintain compensating balances in connection with these
agreements. Under these facilities, none was outstanding at
June 29, 2001. The covenants included in these facilities
include, among others, maintenance of consolidated tangible net
worth of not less than $700 million (which amount is
subject to increase), maintenance of a debt to earnings ratio,
and a limit on total debt to $800 million.

Working capital:

Working capital decreased
$311.4 million from $1,073.1 million at June 30,
2000 to $761.7 million at June 29, 2001. The change
was largely due to the $275.2 million decrease in cash and
cash equivalents and the $285.7 million decrease in
marketable securities described previously. These decreases were
partially offset by an $84.8 million change in current
deferred income taxes related primarily to unrealized gains on
marketable securities; a $102.0 million increase in inventories
and unbilled costs primarily in Harris’ Commercial
Communications segment; and a $73.4 million decrease in
current liabilities due to the payment of short-term debt and
the current portion of long-term debt.

Intangibles resulting from acquisitions:

Intangibles
resulting from acquisitions increased from $166.2 million
at June 30, 2000 to $215.1 million at June 29, 2001.
Total intangibles from acquisitions in fiscal 2001 are 11.0
percent of total assets and 19.3 percent of
shareholder’s equity compared to 7.1 percent of total
assets and 12.1 percent of shareholder’s equity in
fiscal 2000. The increase was due primarily to goodwill recorded
as a result of the WavTrace and Exigent acquisitions. In
determining the amount of purchase price allocated to
intangibles from acquisitions, Harris has used established
valuation techniques used in the communications industry, which
include present value calculations of future cash flows.

Non-current deferred income taxes:

The liability for
non-current deferred income taxes was $14.1 million at
June 30, 2000 versus a $19.5 million asset at
June 29, 2001. The change was due primarily to tax loss
carryforwards resulting from the WavTrace acquisition.

Total debt and capitalization:

At June 29, 2001,
debt totaled $419.4 million, representing 27.3 percent of
total capital (defined as the sum of total debt plus
shareholders’ equity). A year earlier, debt of
$491.0 million was 26.3 percent of total capital. The
increase in this ratio was due primarily to the decrease in
unrealized gains on marketable securities available for sale as
described previously.

In fiscal 2001, Harris issued 137,745 shares of Common Stock to
employees under the terms of Harris’ stock purchase,
option, and incentive plans.

Harris’ debt is currently rated “BBB” by Standard
and Poor’s Ratings Group and “Baa2” by
Moody’s Investors Service. Harris expects to maintain
operating ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios, and balance
sheet ratios sufficient for retention of these debt ratings.

Purchase of Common Stock for treasury:

Harris used
$92.2 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of its
Common Stock in fiscal 2001. Harris’ Board of Directors has
approved a share repurchase program which authorizes the
repurchase of up to 15 million shares through open market
transactions, in negotiated block transactions or pursuant to
tender offers. Harris still has a remaining authorization to
repurchase an additional 1.7 million shares under this
repurchase program.

Additions of plant and equipment:

Additions of plant and
equipment in fiscal 2001 were $55.2 million versus
$81.3 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease is due to a
prior year purchase of a new headquarters building for
Harris’ broadcast communications operation in Mason, Ohio
and the buyout of a lease on a PC board manufacturing plant in
San Antonio, Texas. Total additions for Harris in fiscal 2002
are expected to be approximately $60 million.



Restructuring

In fiscal 1999, Harris recorded a $5.1 million charge
($3.3 million after income taxes) for severance costs
associated with the restructuring of its operations.
Restructuring actions included a work force reduction of
approximately 606 employees. All of these employees were
terminated by June 30, 2000.

In fiscal 2000, Harris recorded a $41 million charge
($26.7 million after income tax) for the restructuring of
its operations. Restructuring actions included a reduction of
approximately 161 employees and provisions for the write-down of
intangible assets, equipment and other assets associated with
the exit from the Commercial Communications segment’s
telephone switching and alarm management product lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161 switching business
employees were notified that their employment would be
terminated and what their specific severance benefit would be.
These employees worked in the marketing, sales, manufacturing,
and administrative areas and were primarily located in Marin
County, California. As of September 29, 2000, the
employment of all 161 employees had been terminated.

In June 2000, Harris sold the core switch business to
Teltronics, Inc. and in August 2000, Harris sold the alarm
management product line. Harris also sold the international
activities of these product lines during fiscal 2001. Estimated
discounted cash flows were used in determining the fair value of
assets and liabilities in recording the restructuring charge.

Harris completed the payment of all severance benefits during
the second quarter of fiscal 2001. No further cash outlays from
these restructuring actions are expected.

Sales from these product lines were none in fiscal 2001,
$73.5 million in fiscal 2000, and $126.6 million in
fiscal 1999. Operating losses from these product lines were none
in fiscal 2001, $18.9 million in fiscal 2000, and
$3.6 million in fiscal 1999.

Purchased In-Process Research and Development

WavTrace

In August 2000, Harris purchased WavTrace, a developer of
broadband microwave radio systems for high-speed wireless access
to the Internet and other data, voice, and video services. Prior
to the acquisition, Harris owned slightly less than
20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase price for the
remaining approximately 80 percent is valued at
$144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as follows:

In connection with the acquisition, Harris allocated
$73.5 million of the purchase price to an in-process
research and development project. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the
development of this project had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal
2001.

In making the purchase price allocation to in-process research
and development, Harris relied on present value calculations of
income, an analysis of project accomplishments and completion
costs, and an assessment of overall contribution and project
risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process research and
development were associated with one significant research
project for which technological feasibility had not been
established. This project was for the development of the
ClearBurst™ GB product (formerly known as the PM 2000).



ClearBurst™ GB is a point-to-multipoint microwave radio
system that is a wireless broadband option to deliver the
Internet and other multimedia services at speeds up to 180 MBPS
per user. The ClearBurst™ GB with BigBurst airlink will use
adaptive time division duplexing (TDD), which is expected to
allow for 100% efficient use of the available spectrum.
ClearBurst™ GB will also use dynamic asymmetry to adjust
for the different data traffic levels of small and large
customers. The technology allocates bandwidth between the uplink
and downlink of a frequency channel to accommodate data traffic.
As a result, adaptive TDD is expected to provide greater
efficiency than predecessor technologies and support 15 times
more customers than current technologies. The estimated stage of
completion of the ClearBurst™ GB project at the time of the
acquisition was 80% (considering time-based, cost-based, and
milestone-based completion measures). ClearBurst™ GB does
not have any significant leverage on any existing technology
developed outside of this project.

The value assigned to purchased in-process research and
development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
the purchased in-process research and development into
commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value using a discount rate of 35 percent.

Remaining development efforts for this in-process research and
development project include various phases of design,
development, and testing. The anticipated completion date for
the in-process research and development project will occur
during fiscal 2003, after which Harris expects to begin
generating economic benefits from the technology over a
seven-year life cycle. Expenditures to complete this project are
not expected to have a material impact on the Harris’
future results of operations or cash flows.

These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties
of the development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. We expect to
continue these development efforts and believe we have a
reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and
development programs. However, there is a risk associated with
the completion of the project and there is no assurance that the
project will attain either technological or commercial success.

Louth Automation

In January 2000, Harris purchased Louth Automation, a leading
supplier of advanced automation systems for radio and television
broadcasters. Harris paid cash in the net amount of
approximately $90 million. The final determination of the
purchase price is subject to adjustment.

In connection with the acquisition, Harris allocated
$10.7 million of the purchase price to in-process research
and development projects. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
to the incomplete products. At the date of acquisition, the
development of these projects had not yet reached technological
feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
as a one-time charge to earnings in the third quarter of fiscal
2000.

In making the purchase price allocation to in-process research
and development, Harris relied on present value calculations of
income, an analysis of project accomplishments and completion
costs, and an assessment of overall contribution and project
risk. The amounts assigned to the in-process research and
development were determined by identifying significant research
projects for which technological feasibility had not been
established. The fair values assigned to each of the significant
projects and the stage of completion are reported below:



A discussion of the most significant project follows:

Version 9.5 of the Automated Device Controller
(“ADC”) Software

:

•

Base ADC product is an all-purpose program/commercial automation
	system with the ability to integrate a wide variety of broadcast
	devices.

•

Version 9.5 provides a link between traffic, engineering, and
	on-air broadcasting operations.

•

The primary functions under development include:

•

The development of Version 9.5 was initiated in early calendar
	1998 (conceptualization of features, etc.).

•

The amount of completion was estimated at 80% (considering
	time-based, cost-based, and milestone-based completion measures).

•

Version 9.5 incorporates significant leverage on existing
	technology from ADC version 9.4. The degree of leverage was
	estimated to be 50%.

The value assigned to purchased in-process research and
development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
the purchased in-process research and development into
commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value using a discount rate of 28 percent.

Remaining development efforts for these in-process research and
development projects included various phases of design,
development, and testing. The completion of the in-process
research and development projects occurred within twelve months
of acquisition. Harris is currently generating economic benefits
from the technologies and expects to generate them over a
seven-year life cycle. Expenditures to complete these projects
did not have a material impact on the Harris’ results of
operations or cash flows.

Retirement Plans

Retirement benefits for substantially all of Harris’
employees are provided primarily through a retirement plan
having profit sharing and savings elements. Harris also provides
limited health-care benefits to retirees who have 10 or more
years of service. All obligations under Harris’ retirement
plans have been fully funded by Harris’ contributions, the
provision for which totaled $30.9 million in fiscal 2001.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 50 percent of Harris’ international
business is transacted in local currency environments. The
impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these
operations to U.S. dollars is included as a component of
shareholders’ equity. At June 29, 2001, the cumulative
translation adjustment reduced shareholders’ equity by
$28.5 million compared to a reduction of $16.5 million
at June 30, 2000.

Harris utilizes foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize
the currency risk of international transactions. Gains and
losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a
material effect on Harris’ results in fiscal 2001, 2000, or
1999.



Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, Harris has consistently followed the
practice of adjusting its prices to reflect the impact of
inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
cost of purchased materials and services.

Market Risk Management

Harris, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to
the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates,
fluctuations in the market value of its equity securities
available for sale, and changes in interest rates. Harris
employs established policies and procedures governing the use of
financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks.

Harris uses foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
balance sheet and off-balance sheet foreign currency
commitments. Specifically, these foreign exchange contracts
offset foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase
commitments from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future
committed sales to customers, and intercompany loans. Management
believes the use of foreign currency financial instruments
should reduce the risks which arise from doing business in
international markets. Contracts are generally for one year or
less. At June 29, 2001, Harris had open foreign exchange
contracts with a notional amount of $43.0 million, of which
$6.3 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$36.7 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
compares to total foreign exchange contracts with a notional
amount of $20.1 million as of June 30, 2000, of which
$4.0 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
$16.1 million were classified as fair value hedges. All of
these derivatives were recorded at their fair value on the
balance sheet as of June 29, 2001, in accordance with FAS
133. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of Harris’
hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility
of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging
instruments. A 10 percent adverse change in currency
exchange rates for Harris’ foreign currency derivatives
held at June 29, 2001 would have an impact of approximately
$3.8 million on the fair value of such instruments. This
quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with
foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into
account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of
Harris’ foreign denominated assets, liabilities, and firm
commitments.

Harris also maintains a portfolio of marketable equity
securities available for sale. These investments result from the
retained interest in sold or spun-off businesses and the
investment into start-up companies that have technology or
products that are of interest to Harris. The fair market value
of these securities at June 29, 2001, was $146.8 million,
compared to $432.5 million at June 30, 2000. This
decrease was primarily due to the sale of some of these
investments in fiscal 2001 and a decrease in these
securities’ quoted market prices. The corresponding
unrealized gain is included as a component of shareholders’
equity. These investments have historically had higher
volatility than most market indices. A 10 percent adverse change
in the quoted market price of marketable equity securities would
have an impact of approximately $14.7 million on the fair
market value of these securities.

Harris utilizes option contracts in the form of cashless collars
to hedge anticipated cash flows from the sale of marketable
securities. Contracts are generally for one year or less. At
June 29, 2001, Harris had open option contracts for 850,000
shares of Intersil Holding Corporation stock at a weighted
average strike price of $32.35, which were classified as cash
flow hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their
fair value on the balance sheet as of June 29, 2001, in
accordance with FAS 133. Factors that could impact the
effectiveness of Harris’ hedging programs include accuracy
of cash flow estimates, volatility of security markets, and the
cost and availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent
adverse change in quoted market price of marketable equity
securities would have an impact of approximately $3 million
on the fair value of such instruments.

Harris utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with
both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates. Harris does not expect changes in
interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows
in fiscal 2002, although there can be no assurances that
interest rates will not significantly change.



Environmental Matters

Harris is actively engaged in complying with environmental
protection laws. In addition to ongoing internal compliance
programs, an estimated $0.1 million was spent on
environmental capital projects in fiscal 2001 and 2000. Harris
estimates that it will authorize $0.1 million in 2002 for
environmental-related capital projects. Under the Superfund Act
or similar state environmental laws, Harris also has potential
liability at various waste sites designated for clean-up. Harris
is named as a potentially responsible party at twelve such sites
where future liabilities could exist. These sites include two
Harris-owned sites, five sites associated with former Harris
locations, and five non-Harris owned treatment or disposal
sites, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to
Harris from past operations. Harris routinely assesses its
contingencies, obligations, and commitments to clean up and
monitor sites in light of in-depth studies, analysis by
environmental experts, and legal reviews. At the two Harris
owned-sites and four sites associated with former Harris
locations, Harris is involved primarily in monitoring and
remediation programs that have been implemented in cooperation
with various environmental agencies. At the other sites, Harris
is involved as one of numerous potentially responsible parties
(PRPs). In ascertaining environmental exposures, management must
assess the extent of contamination, the nature of remedial
actions, continually evolving governmental standards, and the
number, participation level, and financial viability of other
PRPs and other similar variables. Based upon internal and
third-party studies, as well as the remediation and monitoring
expense history at the two Harris-owned sites and five sites
associated with former Harris locations, the number and solvency
of PRPs at the other sites and an assessment of other relevant
factors, Harris has estimated that its discounted liability
under the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent
discount rate, is approximately $5.9 million. Harris has
accrued these discounted liabilities. The expected aggregate
undiscounted amount that will be incurred over the next 20 to
25 years (depending on the number of years for each site)
is approximately $9.9 million. The expected payments for
the next five years are: 2002 — $0.9 million;
2003 — $1.0 million; 2004 —
$1.3 million; 2005 — $0.4 million;
2006 — $0.4 million; and the aggregate amount
thereafter is approximately $5.9 million.

Outlook

Harris is encouraged by its performance during difficult market
conditions for many technology and communication companies.
Harris has leadership positions in broadcast, microwave, and
tactical radio systems that have allowed Harris to outperform
many peer companies in the commercial market, and Harris has a
growing government business that provides good market balance.
The repositioning actions and strategies implemented over the
past two years have helped Harris grow profitably under
difficult market conditions and are expected to further drive
operating leverage when economic conditions improve. In
addition, we are planning further cost reduction actions in our
Microwave Communications business to improve margins and to
better position the business for the expected resumption in
market growth.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Harris Directors and Shareholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 29, 2001
and June 30, 2000 and the related consolidated statements
of income, cash flows, and comprehensive income and
shareholders’ equity for each of the three fiscal years in
the period ended June 29, 2001. Our audits also include the
financial statement schedule listed in the index
Item 14(a). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. The financial statements of
GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC and subsidiaries (a company
in which the Corporation had a 49% interest) have been audited
by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us; insofar
as our opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the
year ended July 2, 1999, relates to data included for
GE-Harris Railway Electronics, LLC and subsidiaries, it is based
solely on their report.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other
auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries at June 29,
2001 and June 30, 2000, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended June 29, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statement taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth herein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation —

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
and its subsidiaries (“Harris”). These statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and require management to make
estimates and assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts
have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year —

Harris’ fiscal year ends on
the Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal Years 2001, 2000, and
1999 include 52 weeks.

Cash Equivalents —

Cash equivalents are
temporary cash investments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased. These investments include accrued interest
and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable equity
securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, included as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
marketable securities are determined using the specific
identification method. The cost basis of marketable securities
was $40.3 million at June 29, 2001, and
$63.5 million at June 30, 2000. The proceeds from the
sale of marketable securities were $127.4 million in fiscal
2001, $52.6 million in fiscal 2000, and $9.9 million
in fiscal 1999. The amount of realized gains included in
“Other income (net)” was $82.4 million in fiscal
2001, $49.6 million in fiscal 2000, and $9.6 million
in fiscal 1999. Included in these realized gains were
write-downs for other than temporary decreases in the market
value of $20.1 million in fiscal 2001.

Inventories —

Inventories are priced at the
lower of cost (determined by average and first-in, first-out
methods) or market.

Plant and Equipment —

Plant and equipment are
carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of buildings,
machinery and equipment is computed by the straight-line and
accelerated methods. The estimated useful lives of buildings
range between 5 and 50 years. The estimated useful lives of
machinery and equipment range between 3 and 10 years.

Intangibles —

Intangibles resulting from
acquisitions are being amortized by the straight-line method
principally over 8 to 15 years. Recoverability of
intangibles is assessed using estimated undiscounted cash flows
of related operations. Intangibles that are not expected to be
recovered through future undiscounted cash flows are charged to
expense when identified. Amounts charged to expense are amounts
in excess of the fair value of the intangible asset. Fair value
is determined as the present value of estimated expected future
cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks
involved.

Income Taxes —

Harris follows the liability
method of accounting for income taxes.

Revenue Recognition —

Revenue is recognized
from sales other than long-term contracts when a product is
delivered, from rentals as they accrue and from services when
performed. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by
the straight-line method over the term of the contracts. If
uncertainty exists about customer acceptance after the delivery
of a product or performance of a service, revenues are not
recognized until acceptance occurs. Further, if an arrangement
other than long-term contracts requires the delivery or
performance of multiple deliverables, or “elements,”
the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have
occurred if there are undelivered elements that are essential to
the functionality of the delivered element.

Revenue and anticipated profits under long-term contracts are
recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using
the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales and profits
are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated
total costs at completion. Contracts are combined when specific
aggregation criteria are met. Criteria generally include closely
interrelated activities performed for a single customer within
the same economic environment. Contracts generally are not
segmented.

Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
and awards applicable to



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and
profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient
information to assess anticipated contract performance.
Incentive provisions, which increase or decrease earnings based
solely on a single significant event, are generally not
recognized until the event occurs.

When adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are
determined, any changes from prior estimates are reflected in
earnings in the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts
or programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

Royalty income is included as a component of “Other income
(net)” on the consolidated statement of income and is
recognized on the basis of terms specified in contractual
agreements.

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on
the consolidated statement of income as “Revenue from
product sales and services” and the associated costs are
classified in “Cost of product sales and services.”

Retirement Benefits —

Harris and its
subsidiaries provide retirement benefits to substantially all
employees primarily through a retirement plan having
profit-sharing and savings elements. Contributions by Harris to
the retirement plan are based on profits and employees’
savings with no other funding requirements. Harris may make
additional contributions to the fund at its discretion.

Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited healthcare
plan for U.S. based retirees and employees on long-term
disability. Harris accrues the estimated cost of these medical
benefits, which are not material, during an employee’s
active service life.

Environmental Expenditures —

Harris capitalizes
environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. Harris accrues environmental expenses resulting
from existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

Harris is named as a potentially responsible party at twelve
sites where future liabilities could exist. These sites include
two Harris-owned sites, five sites associated with former Harris
locations, and five non-Harris owned treatment or disposal
sites, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to
Harris from past operations. Based on an assessment of relevant
factors, Harris has estimated that its discounted liability
under the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent discount
rate, is approximately $5.9 million. This liability is
accrued in the June 29, 2001 consolidated balance sheet.
The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred
over the next 20 to 25 years (depending on the number of
years for each site) is approximately $9.9 million. The
expected payments for the next five years are: 2002 —
$0.9 million; 2003 — $1.0 million;
2004 — $1.3 million; 2005 —
$0.4 million; 2006 — $0.4 million; and the
aggregate amount thereafter is approximately $5.9 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management —

As
part of Harris’ risk management program, Harris uses a
combination of foreign currency call options, foreign currency
forward contracts, and option contracts in the form of cashless
collars for marketable securities to hedge against risks
associated with anticipated cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future and cash flows that are fixed or firmly
committed over the next twelve months. These derivatives have
only nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase. Harris
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.

Harris accounts for its instruments used to hedge against the
currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with
anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
“— Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“Statement 133”), such financial
instruments are marked-to-market using forward prices and fair
market value quotes with the offset to other comprehensive
income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. The foreign currency call
options and forward contracts are subsequently recognized as a
component of “Cost of product sales and services” on
the consolidated statement of income when the underlying net
cash flows are realized. The cashless collars for marketable
securities are subsequently recognized as a component of
“Other income (net)” on the consolidated statement of
income when the underlying net cash flows are realized.
Unrealized losses are recorded in “Other accrued
items” on the consolidated balance sheet with the offset to
other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unrealized gains are recorded as “Other assets” on the
consolidated balance sheet with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.

Harris is exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to these financial
instruments, but it does not expect any of the counterparties to
fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, Harris
selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its
exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and
monitors the market position with each counterparty. In the
event of the termination of a derivative designated as a hedge,
the settlement would be charged to the consolidated income
statement as a component of “Other income (net).”

Foreign Currency Translation —

The functional
currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
of exchange, and income and expense items are translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Unearned Compensation —

Compensation resulting
from performance shares granted under Harris’ long-term
incentive plan is amortized to expense over the performance
period and is adjusted for changes in the market value of
Harris’ Common Stock.

Net Income Per Share —

Net income per share is
based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year.

Reclassifications —

Certain prior-year amounts
have been reclassified on the financial statements to conform
with current year classifications.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective July 1, 2000, Harris adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 —
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”. Statement 133 requires Harris to recognize all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that
are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If
the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset
against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. The
adoption of Statement 133 on July 1, 2000 did not have a
material impact on results of operations but resulted in the
cumulative effect of an accounting change of $0.2 million
after tax being recognized as income in other comprehensive
income. This comprehensive income was recognized on the
consolidated statement of income during fiscal 2001.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
(“SAB 101”), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” SAB 101 summarizes the SEC’s views in
applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
recognition in financial statements. In September 2000, the
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”), issued EITF 00-10
“Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs.”
EITF 00-10 states that all amounts billed to a customer in a
sale transaction related to shipping and handling, if any,
represent revenues earned for the goods provided and should be
classified as revenue. Harris adopted both SAB 101 and EITF
00-10 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 with no material
effect on Harris’ operations or financial position.

In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”), issued FASB Interpretation No. 44
(“FIN No. 44”), “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25.” Among other issues, this
interpretation clarifies the definition of employees for
purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan,
the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms
of a previously fixed stock option or award, and the accounting
for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. Harris adopted FIN No. 44 as of July 1,
2000. The adoption did not have a material effect on
Harris’ operations or financial position.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations”
(“Statement 141”), and No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” (“Statement 142”).
These Statements significantly change the accounting for
business combinations, goodwill, and intangible assets.
Statement 141 eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting for business combinations and further clarifies the
criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from
goodwill. The requirements of Statement 141 are effective for
any business combination accounted for by the purchase method
that is completed after June 30, 2001. Under Statement 142,
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer
amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with
no maximum life). The amortization provisions of Statement 142
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible
assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, companies are
required to adopt Statement 142 in their fiscal year beginning
after December 15, 2001 (i.e., fiscal 2003 for Harris).
Early adoption is permitted for companies with fiscal years
beginning after March 15, 2001, provided that their first
quarter financial statements have not been issued.

Harris will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
2002. Application of the nonamortization provisions of Statement
142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of
$15.6 million ($0.24 per diluted share) per year. During
fiscal 2002, Harris will perform the first of the required
impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets as of July 1, 2001, and has not yet determined what
the effect of these tests will be on Harris’ operations or
financial position.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In fiscal 1999, Harris decided to sell its semiconductor
business and spin off its Lanier Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary.
Accordingly, the results of operations and the net assets of
these business segments have been reclassified as discontinued
operations.

On August 13, 1999, Harris completed the sale of
substantially all of its semiconductor business to Intersil
Corporation and its affiliates. Intersil Corporation was a newly
formed company owned by Sterling Holding Company, LLC, a
Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. investment portfolio company,
along with certain management investors, and affiliates of
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation.

The assets disposed of consisted primarily of land, buildings,
equipment, inventory, receivables, technology, and other assets
related to the operation of the semiconductor business.

In addition to acquiring a 10 percent equity interest in
Intersil Holding Corporation for which Harris paid
$9 million, Harris received cash of $520 million, a
promissory note of $90 million and Intersil Corporation
assumed certain liabilities. Harris also retained receivables
and patent rights. Harris recorded an after-tax loss of
$76 million for the disposal of its entire semiconductor
business including the portion sold to Intersil Corporation.
Intersil Holding Corporation undertook an initial public
offering (IPO) in February of 2000. At that time, the
promissory note mentioned above was paid as was the accrued
interest. Harris has sold portions of its holdings in Intersil.

On October 22, 1999, Harris announced that its Board of
Directors formally approved the spin-off of its Lanier
Worldwide, Inc. subsidiary as an independent publicly traded
company. The Board declared a dividend of one share of Lanier
common stock for each share of Harris Common Stock to Harris
shareholders of record on November 1, 1999. The
distribution of the dividend was completed on November 5,
1999. Harris retained approximately 10 percent of the
outstanding shares of Lanier all of which shares were sold in
fiscal 2001.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations
follows:

The income from discontinued operations includes an allocation
of interest expense of $16.5 million in fiscal 2000 and
$74.1 million in fiscal 1999. This allocation is based on
the assigned debt balances of the discontinued operations.

RESTRUCTURING

In fiscal 1999, Harris recorded a $5.1 million charge
($3.3 million after income taxes) for severance costs
associated with the restructuring of its operations.
Restructuring actions included a work force reduction of
approximately 606 employees. All of these employees were
terminated by June 30, 2000.

In fiscal 2000, Harris recorded a $41 million charge
($26.7 million after income tax) for the restructuring of
its operations. Restructuring actions included a reduction of
approximately 161 employees and provisions for the write-down of
intangible assets, equipment and other assets associated with
the exit from Harris Commercial Communications segment’s
telephone switching and alarm management product lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, 161 switching business
employees were notified that their employment would be
terminated and what their specific severance benefit would be.
These employees worked in the marketing, sales, manufacturing,
and administrative areas and were primarily located in Marin
County, California. As of September 29, 2000, the
employment of all 161 employees had been terminated.

In June of 2000, Harris sold the core switch business to
Teltronics, Inc. and in August of 2000, Harris sold the alarm
management product line. Harris also sold the international
activities of these product lines during fiscal 2001. Estimated
discounted cash flows were used in determining the fair value of
assets and liabilities in recording the restructuring charge.

Harris completed the payment of all severance benefits during
the second quarter of fiscal 2001. No further cash outlays from
these restructuring actions are expected.

Sales from these product lines were none in fiscal 2001,
$73.5 million in fiscal 2000, and $126.6 million in
fiscal 1999. Operating losses from these product lines were none
in fiscal 2001, $18.9 million in fiscal 2000, and $3.6
million in fiscal 1999.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The components and use of restructuring reserves are summarized
below:

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In August 2000, Harris purchased WavTrace, Inc.
(“WavTrace”), a developer of broadband wireless access
systems for high speed wireless access to the Internet and other
data, voice, and video services. This acquisition has been
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the results of operations of WavTrace have been
included in Harris’ consolidated income statement since the
date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Harris owned
slightly less than 20 percent of WavTrace. The purchase
price for the remaining approximately 80 percent is valued
at $144.0 million. The purchase price is calculated as
follows:

The amount of consideration to the former shareholders and
option holders of WavTrace was determined by arm’s-length
negotiation between the parties and was paid out of
interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The amount allocated
to purchased in-process research and development on the WavTrace
acquisition was $73.5 million. The purchased in-process
research and development expenses were determined through
established valuation techniques in the technology
communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed. Research and development
costs to bring the products from the acquired company to
technological feasibility are not expected to have a material
impact on the Harris’ future results of operations or cash
flows. The WavTrace acquisition resulted in goodwill of
$49.6 million and other intangible assets of
$1.3 million. These items are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods between four and eight years.

In May 2001, Harris purchased Exigent International, Inc.
(“Exigent”), a software and service provider for
satellite command and control, telecommunications, and
information technology, primarily for government markets. This
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly,



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the results of operations of Exigent have been included in
Harris’ consolidated income statement since the date of
acquisition. The purchase price of Exigent was
$34.7 million, which is calculated as follows:

The amount of consideration to the former shareholders and
option holders of Exigent was determined by arm’s-length
negotiation between the parties and was paid out of
interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The Exigent
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $18.1 million and other
intangible assets of $2.9 million. These items are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods between five and
fifteen years. The final determination and allocation of the
purchase price and goodwill has not been completed and the
amounts are subject to change. Harris expects to finalize this
allocation during the next six months.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, combines
the consolidated results of operations as if WavTrace and
Exigent had been acquired as of the beginning of the periods
presented, after including the impact of adjustments such as:
amortization of intangibles, decreased interest income from the
use of cash and cash equivalents, compensation expense from
converted options, and the related income tax effects.

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what
actually would have occurred if the acquisition had been in
effect for the entire periods presented. In addition, the pro
forma results are not intended to be a projection of future
results and do not reflect any synergies that might be achieved
from combined operations.

In January 2000, Harris purchased Louth Automation, a leading
supplier of advanced automation systems for radio and television
broadcasters. Also, on June 30, 2000, Harris purchased the
assets of TRT Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point microwave
radio business. These acquisitions have been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results
of operations of these acquired entities have been included in
Harris’ consolidated statement of income since the date of
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effect of these acquisitions was not
material. Harris paid cash in the net amount of approximately
$90 million for Louth Automation and $23 million for
TRT Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point microwave radio
business. The final determination of the Louth Automation
purchase price is subject to adjustment. The amount allocated to
purchased in-process research and development on the Louth
Automation acquisition was $10.7 million. The purchased
in-process research and development expenses were determined
through established valuation techniques in the technology
communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed. Research and development
costs to bring the products from the acquired company to
technological feasibility are not expected to have a material
impact on Harris’ future results of operations or cash
flows. The goodwill and purchased intangible assets in the Louth
Automation and the TRT Lucent Technologies’ point-to-point
microwave radio business acquisitions are amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods between 5 and 16 years.

EXTRAORDINARY LOSS

In June 1999, Harris retired $150.0 million of 10 
3/8% debentures due in 2018 and $96.0 million of notes
payable to insurance companies due from 1999 to 2001. Debt
retirement resulted in an extraordinary loss of
$9.2 million ($.12 per share), net of related income taxes
of $4.7 million.



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

JOINT VENTURES

Harris has investments in joint ventures (less than 50% owned),
which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Condensed balance sheets as of June 29, 2001 and
June 30, 2000, and condensed statements of income for
fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999 for these joint ventures
follows. Harris has adjustments to income related to these
investments that are not pushed down to these condensed
financial statements. The amount of income (loss) before
taxes included in “Other income (net)” related to
these joint ventures is $(9.5) million in fiscal 2001, $(7.5)
million in fiscal 2000, and $7.5 million in fiscal 1999. In
June of 2001 Harris sold its minority interest in the GE-Harris
Railway Electronics, LLC joint venture for $50.0 million
cash, which resulted in a pretax gain of $33.4 million.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unbilled costs and accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts are
net of progress payments of $193.8 million at June 29,
2001 and $180.0 million at June 30, 2000.

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Plant and equipment are summarized below:

INTANGIBLES

Accumulated amortization of intangible assets was
$52.3 million at June 29, 2001 and $52.1 million
at June 30, 2000.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

Harris has available syndicated credit facilities with various
banks that provide for borrowings up to $400 million. The
credit facilities consist of a 3-Year Credit Agreement, which
expires in May of 2004, and a 364-Day Credit Agreement that
expires in May of 2002. Interest rates on borrowings under these
facilities and related fees are determined by a pricing matrix
based upon Harris’ long-term debt rating assigned by
Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group and Moody’s
Investors Service. Harris is not required to maintain
compensating balances in connection with these agreements. Under
these facilities, none was outstanding at June 29, 2001.
The covenants included in these facilities include, among
others, maintenance of consolidated tangible net worth of not
less than $700 million (which amount is subject to
increase), maintenance of a debt to earnings ratio, and a limit
on total debt to $800 million.

Harris also has lines of credit for short-term financing
aggregating $78.4 million from various U.S. and foreign banks,
of which $45.2 million was available on June 29, 2001.
These arrangements provide for borrowing at various interest
rates, are reviewed annually for renewal, and may be used on
such terms as Harris and the banks mutually agree. These lines
do not require compensating balances.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term debt of $33.2 million at June 29, 2001 and
$75.6 million at June 30, 2000 is entirely made up of
notes payable to banks in both years. Bank notes with Brazilian
banks amounted to $10.0 million at June 29, 2001 with
a weighted-average interest rate of 18.9 percent, and
$26.0 million at June 30, 2000 with a weighted-average
interest rate of 18.1 percent. The weighted-average
interest rate for bank notes other than those with Brazilian
banks was 4.9 percent at June 29, 2001 and
6.4 percent at June 30, 2000.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt includes the following:



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted-average interest rate for notes payable to banks
was 6.6 percent at June 29, 2001 and 6.4 percent
at June 30, 2000. Maturities of long-term debt for the five
years following fiscal 2001 are: $1.8 million in fiscal
2002, $32.4 million in fiscal 2003, $1.1 million in
fiscal 2004, $0.5 million in fiscal 2005, and
$0.1 million in fiscal 2006.

In Fiscal 2002, Harris expects to refinance the 6.65%
debentures, which are due 2006. The expected refinancing results
from the debenture holders’ call option and is not expected
to have a material impact on Harris’ results of operations.
It is management’s intent to maintain this debt for longer
than one year. Thus, this amount has not been classified in
current liabilities and remains in long-term debt on the balance
sheet.

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On December 6, 1996, Harris declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
Common Stock. These rights, which expire on December 6,
2006, are evidenced by Common Stock share certificates and trade
with the Common Stock until they become exercisable and entitle
the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
Participating Preferred Stock for $125, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of 10 business
days (or such later date fixed by the Board) after a party
commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire a beneficial
interest of at least 15% of Harris’ outstanding Common
Stock, or the first date of public announcement by Harris that a
person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least 15% of
Harris’ outstanding Common Stock, or such later date fixed
by the Board of Directors of Harris.

Upon the first date of public announcement by Harris that a
person has acquired a beneficial interest of at least 15% of the
Harris’ outstanding Common Stock, or such later date fixed
by the Board of Directors of Harris, each right (other than
rights beneficially owned by an acquiring person or any
affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the holder to
purchase shares of Common Stock of Harris having a market value
equal to twice the exercise price of the right. In addition,
each right (other than rights beneficially owned by an acquiring
person or any affiliate or associate thereof) would entitle the
rightholder to exercise the right and receive shares of common
stock of the acquiring company, upon a merger or other business
combination, having a market value of twice the exercise price
of the right.

Under certain circumstances after the rights become exercisable,
the Board of Directors may elect to exchange all of the then
outstanding rights for shares of Common Stock at an exchange
ratio of one share of Common Stock per right, subject to
adjustment. The rights have no voting privileges and may be
redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $.01 per right
at any time prior to the acquisition of a beneficial ownership
of 15% of the outstanding Common Stock.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The following information relates to stock option and incentive
stock awards. Option prices are 100 percent of market value
on the date the options are granted. Option grants are for a
maximum of ten years after dates of grant and may be exercised
in installments.

Price ranges of outstanding and exercisable options at
June 29, 2001 are summarized below:

Presented below is pro forma information regarding net income
and net income per share. It has been determined as if Harris
had accounted for stock options using the fair value method of
accounting for stock options. The fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions:

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value
of options is amortized to expense over their three-year vesting
period. Under the fair value method, Harris’ net income and
net income per share would have been reduced as follows:

Harris has stock incentive plans for directors and employees.
Awards under these plans may include the grant of performance
shares, restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation
rights or other stock-based awards. Performance shares
outstanding under the stock incentive plans were 139,342 at
June 29, 2001, 209,716 at June 30, 2000, and 429,869
at July 2, 1999. Shares of Common Stock reserved for future
awards under the stock incentive plan were 11,505,987 at
June 29, 2001, 3,242,441 at June 30, 2000, and
2,296,417 at July 2, 1999.

Under Harris’ domestic retirement plan, employees may
purchase a limited amount of Harris’ Common Stock at
70 percent of current market value. The discounts from fair
market value on Common Stock purchased by employees under the
domestic retirement plans are charged to compensation expense in
the period of the related purchase. Shares of Common Stock
reserved for future purchases by the retirement plan were
2,172,688 at June 29, 2001.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
$365.4 million of undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries because of Harris’ intention to reinvest these
earnings. The determination of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax
liability for the undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries is not practicable.

Tax loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates ranging
between 3 and 20 years.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Harris is structured primarily around the markets it serves and
operates in two business segments — Government
Communications and Commercial Communications. The Government
Communications segment engages in advanced research and
develops, designs, and produces advanced communication and
information processing systems. The Commercial Communications
segment produces broadcast, radio communications, and
telecommunications products and systems. Harris’ products
and systems are produced principally in the United States with
international revenues derived primarily from exports.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
as those described in the Significant Accounting Policies
footnote. Harris evaluates performance based on profit or loss
from operations before income taxes excluding interest income
and expense, equity income, and gains or losses from securities
and other investments. Intersegment sales, which are
insignificant, are accounted for at prices comparable to
unaffiliated customers.

Sales made to the U.S. government by all segments (primarily the
Government Communications segment) as a percent of total
revenues from continuing operations were 41.8 percent in
fiscal 2001, 40.6 percent in fiscal 2000, and
42.3 percent in fiscal 1999.
