    communications, government communications and broadcast
    communications.

Harris Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the
    successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard,
    Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is

(321) 727-9100.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “HRS.” On July 2, 2010, we employed
    approximately 15,800 people. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
    “us,” “Company” and “Harris” as
    used in this Report refer to Harris Corporation and its
    subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report our
    financial results in the following three business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses;

•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of our
    (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National Intelligence

    form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all
    the shares of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (now known as Aviat
    Networks, Inc.) (“HSTX”) common stock owned by us, we
    eliminated as a reporting segment our former HSTX segment.
    Accordingly, our historical financial results have been restated
    to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in this Report, and unless otherwise specified,
    disclosures in this Report relate



solely to our continuing operations. For additional information
    regarding discontinued operations, see

Note 3:
    Discontinued Operations

    Statements.

Recent
    Acquisitions

Acquisition of Patriot Technologies, LLC.

On
    November 16, 2009, we acquired Patriot Technologies, LLC
    (“Patriot”), which was privately held and had about
    100 employees. Patriot is a leading provider of Department
    of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) healthcare information
    technology (“IT”), imaging and enterprise software
    solutions. We report Patriot within our Government
    Communications Systems segment. The acquisition of Patriot
    expanded our position as a leading provider of integrated and
    interoperable healthcare IT solutions for the
    U.S. Government market. Additionally, we believe the
    acquisition further positions us for providing a comprehensive
    solution addressing the national priority of integrating the VA
    and Military Health Systems.

Acquisition of SignaCert, Inc.

On May 28,
    2010, we acquired privately held SignaCert, Inc.
    (“SignaCert”), a leading provider of IT compliance
    solutions that form the foundation for software supply chain
    assurance. We report SignaCert within our Government
    Communications Systems segment. The acquisition of SignaCert
    expanded our position as a leading provider of cyber solutions
    for U.S. Government and commercial customers, strengthened
    our cyber leadership team, brings discriminating technology to
    our cyber portfolio and better positions us to provide trusted,
    comprehensive solutions that address the national priority of
    enhancing critical cyber infrastructure.

Subsequent
    Event — Acquisition of CapRock

On July 30, 2010, after the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    acquired privately held CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc.
    (collectively, “CapRock”), a global provider of

mission-critical

managed satellite communications services for the government,
    energy and maritime markets. CapRock’s highly reliable
    solutions include broadband Internet access, voice over Internet
    Protocol (“VOIP”) telephony, wideband networking and
    real-time video, delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around
    the world, including many very harsh and remote locations, by
    leveraging

best-of-breed

partnerships, technical expertise and its robust global
    infrastructure that includes four self-owned and operated
    teleports and eleven regional support centers across North
    America, Central and South America, Europe, West Africa and Asia
    Pacific. The purchase price for CapRock was $525 million in
    cash, subject to possible post-closing upward or downward
    adjustment. We will report CapRock within our Government
    Communications Systems segment. The acquisition of CapRock
    increased the breadth of our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities while enabling us to enter new vertical markets and
    increase our international presence.

Description
    of Business by Segment

RF
    Communications

RF Communications is a global supplier of secure tactical radio
    communications and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for
    military and government organizations and also of secure
    communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility
    and transportation markets. RF Communications is comprised of
    our (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses.

Tactical Radio Communications:

We design,
    develop and manufacture a comprehensive line of secure radio
    communications products and systems for manpack, handheld,
    soldier-worn, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
    applications that operate in various radio frequency
    bands — high-frequency (“HF”), very
    high-frequency (“VHF”) and ultra high-frequency
    (“UHF”) — over satellite communications
    (“SATCOM”) and in multiband mode. These radio systems
    are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting
    diverse mission requirements. Our
    Falcon

®

family of tactical radios is built on a software-defined radio
    platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software
    upgrades. Our Falcon radios also have the highest grade embedded
    encryption and provide highly mobile, secure and reliable
    network communications capability without relying on a fixed
    infrastructure. This capability allows warfighters, for example,
    to remain connected with each other, their command structures
    and



support organizations, and gives them the ability to communicate
    information and maintain situational awareness of both friendly
    and opposing forces, which are critical to both the safety and
    success of their missions.

Unlike many of our competitors in the U.S. Government
    market, we operate this business on a “commercial”
    customer and market-driven business model, as opposed to a
    government programs-driven business model. This means that we
    anticipate market needs, invest our internal research and
    development resources, build to our internal forecast, and
    provide

ready-to-ship,

commercial,

off-the-shelf

(“COTS”) products to customers more quickly than
    customers can typically obtain similar products under
    government-funded programs.

Our Falcon
    III

®

family of radios is the next generation of multiband,
    multi-mission tactical radios, which supports the
    U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System
    (“JTRS”) requirements as well as network-centric
    operations worldwide. Our Falcon III radios address the
    full range of current mission and interoperability requirements
    and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical
    standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in
    our Falcon III radios include extended frequency range,
    significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous
    generations and programmable encryption.

Our Falcon III multiband handheld radio, the AN/PRC-152(C)
    (“152C”), is the world’s most widely deployed
    JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio and was our first
    Falcon III radio to be fielded. We have successfully
    fielded more than 100,000 152Cs, which are widely fielded by all
    branches of the U.S. Department of Defense
    (“DoD”), many allies worldwide and U.S. Federal
    agencies. The 152C offers users a wide range of capabilities,
    such as legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne System
    (“SINCGARS”) interoperability; UHF

ground-to-ground

line-of-sight

communications; close-air support; tactical SATCOM; and the
    Association of Public Safety Communications
    Officials — International (“APCO”) P25
    waveform to provide direct communications with first responders.
    The 152C also serves as the handheld-based transceiver of our
    Falcon III AN/VRC-110, a

high-performance,

multiband vehicular system that offers the added feature of easy
    vehicle dismount — a

“grab-and-go”

feature that delivers continuous communications when removed
    from the vehicle, an important capability in urban environments.

Our Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G
    (“117G”), is the first JTRS Software Communications
    Architecture (“JTRS SCA”)-certified and National
    Security Agency (“NSA”) Type-1 certified manpack radio
    system providing wideband networking capability, enabling the
    transition to a networked battlefield communications environment
    and high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video,
    simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat, and
    connectivity to secure networks (“SIPRNet”). The
    117G’s wideband network access capabilities give
    warfighters and field commanders critical real-time information.
    The 117G has been deployed to all branches of the DoD and is
    being used in a wide variety of ground, vehicular and airborne
    applications, including intelligence, surveillance and
    reconnaissance (“ISR”). The radio offers an extended
    frequency range of 30 megahertz to 2 gigahertz. The 117G
    includes a Remote Operated Video Enhanced Receiver
    (“ROVER”) interoperable mode that provides warfighters
    on the battlefield with the ability to receive live video
    directly from unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”). This
    capability allows users to receive video feeds directly from
    UAVs without an intermediary or having to pass that information
    from a base station. In fiscal 2010, we announced the
    development of new mission modules that can be integrated with
    new and already fielded 117Gs to provide greater flexibility and
    mission-specific customization of the radios. The modules enable
    users to add to the 117G, quickly, seamlessly, selectively and
    on an as-needed basis, advanced capabilities and expanded
    functions such as a second wideband radio channel, an HF radio
    channel or an ISR module. The modules also are a “future
    focused” solution designed to keep pace with changing
    technologies in tactical communications, allowing integration
    into the 117G of newly developed capabilities to address future
    requirements.

Our cryptographic solutions encompass NSA-certified products and
    systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems, including our
    Sierra

®

and
    Citadel

®

embedded encryption solutions and our SecNet

®

and SecNet

tm

Internet Protocol (“IP”) communications families of
    communications security (“COMSEC”) terminals.

In the international market, our tactical radios are the
    standard of NATO and Partnership for Peace countries and are
    sold to more than 100 countries through our strong, longstanding
    international distribution channels consisting of regional sales
    offices and a broad dealer network. International tactical radio
    demand is being driven by continuing tactical communications
    modernization and standardization programs to provide more
    sophisticated communications capabilities to address traditional
    and emerging threats and to provide interoperability. In fiscal
    2010, we received tactical radio orders from,

and/or

made
    deliveries to, a wide range of international customers,
    including Australia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi
    Arabia, Sweden and Yemen, as well as other countries in the
    Middle East and Central Asia. Additionally, we are providing
    integrated communications systems for the international market.
    Our integrated systems offerings are largely based on our
    products, but include other



companies’ products, as well as a wide variety of
    applications, in order to implement integrated command, control,
    communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and
    reconnaissance (“C4ISR”) systems for many different
    types of platforms, including command post and transit case
    systems, vehicular and shelter communications systems and
    specialized airborne applications, which are frequently used in
    border security and surveillance systems.

Public Safety and Professional
    Communications:

We supply

assured
    communications

®

systems and equipment for public safety, federal, utility,
    commercial and transportation markets, with products ranging
    from complete

end-to-end

wireless network infrastructure solutions, including advanced IP
    voice and data networks, that support multiple platforms and
    provide interoperability among disparate systems, to portable
    and mobile single-band and multiband radios, to public
    safety-grade broadband video and data solutions. On May 29,
    2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets of the Tyco
    Electronics wireless systems business (“Wireless
    Systems”) (formerly known as M/A-COM). Our acquisition of
    Wireless Systems served to form our Public Safety and
    Professional Communications business. This business has more
    than 80 years of experience and supports over 500 systems
    around the world.

As part of our business of designing, building, distributing,
    maintaining and supplying wireless communications systems, we
    offer our Voice, Interoperability, Data and Access
    (“VIDA”) network solution — a unique,

cost-effective

IP-based

network that is flexible, responsive, expandable and easily
    upgradeable, and that supports a full line of communications
    systems, including
    OpenSky

®

,

    NetworkFirst,
    P25

IP

and

    Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
    (“EDACS”), allowing seamless interconnection of
    diverse systems. Our VIDA network solutions currently serve as
    the backbone in some of the largest and most advanced statewide
    and regional communications networks in North America, including
    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and State of Florida.

In addition to a full range of single-band land mobile radio
    terminals, we offer our
    Unity

tm

family of multiband radios, including the Unity XG-100P handheld
    radio and the new Unity XG-100M full-spectrum mobile radio. Our
    Unity multiband radios cover all public safety frequency bands
    in a single radio; operate on APCO P25 conventional and trunked
    systems; are backwards compatible with analog FM systems; and
    include advanced capabilities, such as an internal Global
    Positioning System (“GPS”) receiver for situational
    awareness, internal secure
    Bluetooth

®

wireless technology, and background noise suppression features.
    They also include true software-defined radio architecture that
    allows flexibility for future growth, including a software-only
    upgrade to APCO P25 Phase 2, the next-generation emerging
    standard for mission-critical communications. Our Unity
    radios’ multiband, multi-mode capabilities enable a single
    radio to communicate with multiple organizations, jurisdictions
    and agencies operating on different frequencies and systems,
    thus providing a significant improvement over most current radio
    systems for U.S. public safety, which are not interoperable
    and thus require users to carry multiple radios or route
    transmissions through ad-hoc network bridges, often configured
    at the time of an emergency, and creating instances where
    agencies responding to a common incident cannot talk to each
    other.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the RF Communications segment increased 17 percent to
    $2,067 million in fiscal 2010 compared with
    $1,761 million in fiscal 2009, and was $1,507 million
    in fiscal 2008. Segment operating income increased
    24 percent to $707.4 million in fiscal 2010 compared
    with $571.5 million in fiscal 2009, and was
    $525.5 million in fiscal 2008. The RF Communications
    segment contributed 40 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2010 compared with 35 percent in fiscal 2009 and
    32 percent in fiscal 2008. The percentage of this
    segment’s revenue that was derived outside of the United
    States was 20 percent in fiscal 2010 compared with
    39 percent in fiscal 2009 and 27 percent in fiscal
    2008. U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, accounted for approximately
    66 percent of this segment’s total revenue in fiscal
    2010 compared with approximately 79 percent in fiscal 2009
    and 82 percent in fiscal 2008. For a general description of
    our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a
    discussion of revenue generated from

cost-reimbursement

versus fixed-price contracts, see “Item 1.

    missions. Our major technology capabilities include SATCOM
    terminals for transportable ground, fixed-site and shipboard
    applications; flat-panel and phased-array antennas; aviation
    electronics for military jets and helicopters, including radios,
    digital maps, modems, sensors, data buses, fiber optics and
    microelectronics; high-speed data links and data networks for
    wireless communications and smart weapons; and advanced ground
    control systems.

For example, our mobile ad hoc networking capability allows the
    military to take its communications infrastructure with it,
    creating mobile, self-forming and self-healing networks across
    the battlefield. Our Highband Networking
    Radio

tm

(“HNR”) provides secure, wireless, high-bandwidth (30
    megabits per second),

on-the-move

communications among users of widely dispersed local area
    networks (“LANs”) by establishing

line-of-sight

connectivity using a Harris-developed waveform that
    automatically selects the best communications path available,
    allowing seamless communication of voice, video and data to all
    levels of command. We announced in fiscal 2009 that our HNR
    system was deployed to the U.S. Army 101st Airborne
    Division (Air Assault) 2nd Brigade Combat Team in Iraq,
    which was the first combat deployment of the HNR system. In
    fiscal 2010, we were awarded a contract to provide HNRs to form
    the communications backbone of the U.S. Army’s new
    Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System
    (“IBCS”). We also are currently producing and
    delivering HNRs under a Warfighter Information Network-Tactical
    (“WIN-T”) Increment 2 low-rate initial production
    (“LRIP”) contract. HNRs provide the first-ever use of
    directive beam technology to achieve higher throughput over
    longer distances in a robust, self-forming and self-healing
    directional mesh network.

Examples of ongoing programs for us include the following:

•

The U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals
    (“MET”) program, for which we are developing, under a
    ten-year contract awarded to us in fiscal 2009 that is
    potentially worth $600 million, next-generation large
    satellite earth stations to provide the worldwide backbone for
    high-priority military communications and missile defense
    systems and to support IP and Dedicated Circuit Connectivity
    within the Global Information Grid (“GIG”), providing
    critical reach-back capability for the warfighter;

•

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“F-35”), F-22 Raptor
    and

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet aircraft platform programs, for which we provide
    high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber
    optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image
    processing, digital map software and other electronic
    components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link
    (“MADL”) communications subsystems primarily intended
    for stealth platform

communications services such as high-speed Internet access and
    video communications, and for which we successfully completed in
    fiscal 2010 development of the Unit Level Variant
    (“ULV”) and Force Level Variant (“FLV”)
    and delivery of the first production lot of ULV terminals.



National Intelligence Programs:

A significant
    portion of this business involves classified programs. While
    classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report,
    the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe
    that the business risks associated with those programs do not
    differ materially from the business risks of other
    U.S. Government programs.

We are a major developer, supplier and integrator of
    communications and information processing products, systems and
    networks for a diverse base of U.S. Intelligence Community
    programs, and we support the ongoing transformation of the
    Intelligence Community into a more collaborative enterprise.
    Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency
    customers, including NSA and the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (“NGA”), we provide ISR
    solutions that improve situational awareness, data collection
    accuracy and product analysis by correlating near real-time
    mission data and intelligence reference data for display and
    analysis by strategic and tactical planners and decision makers.
    Our ISR systems help to integrate information across the analyst
    workflow, accelerating the movement of information that has been
    collected and processed. We strive to produce innovative ISR
    solutions that provide our customers with information dominance
    for battle-space superiority.

For example, our image processing capabilities extend from
    algorithm development through delivery of operations systems,
    and we are providing advanced image exploitation and
    dissemination solutions for ISR applications by advancing image
    processing, image data fusion, display technologies and digital
    product generation techniques. Those technologies range from new
    techniques for merging and displaying imagery to automated
    techniques for image screening, cueing and remote visualization.
    Also, our mapping and visualization capabilities provide
    complete, accurate and timely knowledge about the threat, the
    terrain, the status and the location of single or multiple
    opposing and friendly forces and their support by utilizing
    data, pictures, voice and video drawn from vast storage banks or
    from real-time input which can be transmitted around the world
    in fractions of a second. In addition, we have industry-leading
    capabilities in the architecture, design and development of
    highly specialized satellite antennas, structures, phased arrays
    and on-board processors, which are used to enable
    next-generation satellite systems to provide the
    U.S. military and intelligence communities with strategic
    and tactical advantages. We are also a leader in the design and
    development of antenna and reflector technologies for commercial
    space telecommunications applications. Further, our capabilities
    include developing and supplying

state-of-the-art

wireless voice and data products and solutions, including
    surveillance and tracking equipment, spanning vehicular,

man-portable,

airborne and system-level applications for the
    U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement community.

During fiscal 2010, we were awarded a number of new contracts
    and follow-on contracts under classified programs. We also have
    expanded our capabilities and customer footprint in the cyber
    security market through our acquisition of Crucial Security,
    Inc. (“Crucial”) in fiscal 2009. Crucial offers an
    array of mission-enabling engineering solutions that address
    both offensive and defensive IT security challenges, providing
    critical support to Federal law enforcement and other
    U.S. Government agencies.

Civil Programs:

We provide highly reliable,
    mission-critical communications and information processing
    systems that meet the most demanding needs of customers in the
    U.S. civilian Federal market, including the Federal
    Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Census Bureau,
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (“NOAA”) and Department of Health and Human Services
    (“HHS”). We use our ability to implement and manage
    large, complex programs that integrate secure, advanced
    communications and information processing technologies in order
    to improve productivity and information processing and to
    achieve cost savings for our customers. Our networks and
    information systems for large-scale, geographically dispersed
    enterprises offer advanced capabilities for collecting,
    processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying, distributing,
    storing and retrieving data. We are a leader in satellite ground
    data processing and mission

command-and-control

(“C2”) systems. Our ground data processing systems
    consist of complex suites of hardware and software that receive
    sensor data from satellites, turning it into useable
    information. Our C2 systems feature COTS design and high levels
    of flexibility, are designed for government and commercial
    applications, and support single-satellite missions as well as
    some of the largest and most complex satellite fleets deployed.

For example, we are the prime contractor under a

15-year

contract, awarded in July 2002 that is potentially worth
    $3.5 billion, for the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure
    (“FTI”) program to integrate, modernize, operate and
    maintain the communications infrastructure for the U.S. air
    traffic control system. FTI is a modern, secure and efficient
    network providing voice, data and video communications deployed
    at more than 4,500 FAA sites across the U.S., to enhance network
    efficiency, reliability and security and improve service while
    reducing operating costs. We designed and deployed the FTI
    network and it is fully operational. The FTI network consists of
    the Operations Network, the Mission Support Network, the
    Satellite Network and the Microwave Network. The supporting
    infrastructure includes the Network Operations Control Centers
    (“NOCCs”) and Security Operations Control Centers



(“SOCCs”). The FTI program has completed its equipment
    build-out phase and is transitioning to its telecommunication
    services and maintenance phase. In addition to being the prime
    contractor and system architect for the FTI program, other FAA
    programs we have developed include: the Weather and Radar
    Processor, a weather system serving the en-route air traffic
    control environment; OASIS, which provided integrated weather
    briefing and flight planning capabilities for preflight weather
    briefings and in-flight updates; the Voice Switching and Control
    System, which provides the critical

air-to-ground

communications links between en-route aircraft and air traffic
    controllers throughout the continental United States; and the
    satellite-based Alaskan National Airspace System
    (“NAS”) Interfacility Communications System. In the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we were awarded a six-year
    contract, potentially worth $97 million, with the FAA for
    the Weather and Radar Maintenance and Sustainment
    Services II program, the scope of which includes software
    maintenance releases, depot support,

on-site

field support and engineering services at 22 operational FAA
    facilities in the U.S. Our acquisition in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009 of the Air Traffic Control business unit
    (“SolaCom ATC”) of SolaCom Technologies, Inc. provided
    us with an immediate ability to address additional segments of
    the air traffic control voice/data systems market and we believe
    further positioned us to support the FAA’s anticipated Next
    Generation Air Transportation System (“NextGen”)
    program.

Under the U.S. Census Bureau’s Field Data Collection
    Automation (“FDCA”) program, awarded to us during
    fiscal 2006 in support of the 2010 census, we are the prime
    contractor responsible for integrating multiple automated
    systems. The FDCA program is nearing completion.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we were awarded a ten-year
    contract, potentially worth $736 million, to provide a
    complete,

end-to-end

solution for NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellite — Series R Ground Segment (“GOES-R
    GS”) program, under which we will design, develop, deploy
    and operate the ground segment system, which will receive and
    process satellite data and generate and distribute weather data
    to more than 10,000 direct users. We will also provide the
    command and control of operational satellites under the GOES-R
    GS program. Following the close of the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2010, we were awarded a ten-year contract, potentially worth
    $130 million, to supply antennas and control systems for
    NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellite — Series R (“GOES-R”)
    program. The antennas will provide communications links for
    command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as the
    communications link to direct data users. The new antennas will
    operate with next-generation GOES-R satellites and will be
    compatible with existing GOES-N through GOES-P satellites.

In our Healthcare Solutions business, we are continuing to focus
    on delivering standards-based interoperable healthcare solutions
    for government and commercial clients with security, privacy and
    patients in control of how their information is shared. For
    example, we are developing and integrating, under a contract
    from HHS, an

open-source

National Health Information Network (“NHIN”) CONNECT
    Gateway solution designed to enable seamless health information
    sharing among multiple Federal agencies and regional healthcare
    providers. We are developing a multi-hospital military health
    network with image-sharing capabilities under the DoD Military
    Health System global Healthcare Artifact and Image Management
    Solution (“HAIMS”) program. As described under
    “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report, we acquired Patriot during
    the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In the third quarter of
    fiscal 2010, we were awarded a three-year contract, potentially
    worth $72 million, from the VA for further improvements to
    the complex billing and collection activities of the VA, one of
    the largest healthcare delivery organizations in the world with
    21 networks and 170 medical centers nationwide. We were awarded
    the contract after successfully implementing a pilot project for
    the VA’s Mid-Atlantic region.

In our Cyber Integrated Solutions business, we announced in
    fiscal 2010 that we are establishing the Harris Cyber
    Integration Center, which we believe can leverage our extensive
    cyber capabilities to address the evolving critical cyber
    infrastructure challenges of our government and commercial
    customers through a unique managed hosting service in a trusted
    environment. The Harris Cyber Integration Center will provide an
    integrated offering of infrastructure, managed security and
    tailored applications and services — all provided as a
    secure, trusted total solution. The center will feature a
    trusted technology infrastructure, including a tested and
    accredited environment, supply chain integrity and advanced
    persistent threat deterrence. Additionally, the center will
    offer industry-tailored applications and services on a tiered
    structure, providing both flexibility of service and superior
    value. The new Harris Cyber Integration Center will be located
    in a 140,000-square-foot facility in Harrisonburg, Virginia that
    we acquired in fiscal 2010. We expect the center to be fully
    operational in early calendar 2011. Also in fiscal 2010, we
    acquired SignaCert as described under “Item 1.
    Business — Recent Acquisitions” of this Report.
    SignaCert’s IT compliance solutions combine powerful change
    detection capabilities with custom and commercial software
    whitelists — lists of software that are deemed safe
    and approved for a customer’s network. As an industry
    leader in cyber security, we have been using

state-of-the-art

technology assessment techniques and architecture engineering
    for decades to define and operate secure networks supporting

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the Government Communications Systems segment decreased
    1 percent to $2,688 million in fiscal 2010 compared
    with $2,710 million in fiscal 2009, and was
    $2,478 million in fiscal 2008. Segment operating income
    increased 11 percent to $337.0 million in fiscal 2010
    compared with $302.8 million in fiscal 2009, and was
    $226.0 million in fiscal 2008. This segment contributed
    51 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2010 compared
    with 54 percent in fiscal 2009 and 54 percent in
    fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2010, approximately 74 percent of
    revenue for this segment was under direct contracts with
    customers and approximately 26 percent of revenue was under
    contracts with prime contractors, compared with approximately
    72 percent of revenue under direct contracts with customers
    and approximately 28 percent of revenue under contracts
    with prime contractors in fiscal 2009 and approximately
    74 percent of revenue under direct contracts with customers
    and approximately 26 percent of revenue under contracts
    with prime contractors in fiscal 2008. Some of this
    segment’s more significant programs in fiscal 2010 included
    FTI, Patriot, NETCENTS, NMCI, FDCA,

GOES-R,

NSOM, F-35 and various classified programs. This segment’s
    largest program by revenue in a particular fiscal year
    represented approximately 9 percent of this segment’s
    revenue in fiscal 2010, compared with approximately
    13 percent in fiscal 2009 and approximately 9 percent
    in fiscal 2008. This segment’s 10 largest programs by
    revenue in a particular fiscal year represented approximately
    41 percent of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2010,
    approximately 46 percent in fiscal 2009 and approximately
    45 percent in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2010, this segment had
    a diverse portfolio of over 300 programs. Historically, that
    diversity has provided a stable backlog and reduced potential
    risks that come from reductions in funding or changes in
    customer priorities, and we expect that program diversity will
    continue to provide similar benefits in the future, although we
    can give no assurance. In fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008, U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, accounted for approximately
    96 percent of this segment’s total revenue. For a
    general description of our U.S. Government contracts and
    subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated from
    cost-reimbursement versus fixed-price contracts, see
    “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
    Government Contracts” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $1,238 million at July 2, 2010 compared with
    $1,146 million at July 3, 2009 and $836 million
    at June 27, 2008. Unfunded backlog for this segment was
    $3,276 million at July 2, 2010 compared with
    $4,002 million at July 3, 2009 and $3,760 million
    at June 27, 2008. We expect to fill approximately
    77 percent of this funded backlog during fiscal 2011, but
    we can give no assurance of such fulfillment. Additional
    information regarding funded and unfunded backlog is provided
    under “Item 1. Business — Funded and
    Unfunded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating
    to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see
    “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers;
    Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of
    this Report.

Transmission Systems:

We develop, manufacture
    and supply digital and analog television and radio transmission
    systems for delivery of rich media over wireless broadcast
    terrestrial networks on a worldwide basis, including mobile TV
    applications. We can provide single products or

end-to-end

systems, including nationwide networks with hundreds of
    transmitters. Our television and radio transmission systems
    solutions are scalable to meet the needs of broadcasters of all
    sizes. We are a leader in television’s transition from
    analog to digital technology and in technology for the
    U.S. digital standard known as “ATSC” and the
    European digital standard “DVB-T.” In fiscal 2007, we
    introduced with LG Electronics Inc. the jointly developed Mobile
    Handheld in-band mobile digital TV system (“M/H”), a
    new technology capable of providing digital TV (“DTV”)
    signals and extending

over-the-air

broadcast TV signals beyond customary TV viewing at home to
    mobile, pedestrian and other handheld devices (such as mobile
    phones or laptop computers). Our products also include our
    Maxiva

tm

line of UHF multimedia transmitters, comprised of our Maxiva ULX
    Series of liquid-cooled transmitters for high-power UHF
    multimedia broadcasters and our Maxiva UAX Series of air-cooled,
    solid-state transmitters for low-power UHF transmission.

We are also a leader in the transition from analog to digital
    radio. Our product offerings address the U.S. digital
    standard called “IBOC” (In-Band/On-Channel), which is
    referred to in the market as “HD
    Radio

®

,”

    as well as international digital standards including
    “DAB” and “DRM.” Our radio transmission
    products include our
    Intraplex

®

line of audio transport products, including

studio-to-transmitter

links, and our
    FLEXSTAR

tm

family, which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so
    broadcasters can offer supplemental audio and data capability



along with the main program stream, offering listeners 5.1
    surround sound, on-demand traffic, weather and sports reports,

store-and-play

capabilities and real-time navigation.

This segment also is focused on three principal growth areas.
    First, in many international markets, the transition from analog
    to digital broadcasting is just beginning, which we believe will
    result in growing demand for both digital transmission systems
    and related infrastructure. Second, in the U.S. Government
    market for full-motion video systems, we believe we have unique
    technology capabilities. Our Full-Motion Video Asset Management
    Engine
    (“FAME

tm

”)

    solution provides our U.S. Government customers with
    greater visibility into increasing amounts of digital ISR
    information, including real-time and archived video, such as
    that collected from manned and unmanned aircraft and
    ground-based sensors. FAME is a COTS-based solution developed
    based on our digital asset management technologies, input from
    intelligence analysts and our Government Communications Systems
    segment’s image processing, system integration and security
    capabilities. Third, in digital

out-of-home

advertising, our solutions enable advertisers to reach consumers
    on the move, and we believe new systems will be increasingly
    deployed to deliver rich media content in live sports and
    entertainment venues and in retail establishments.

Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:

Revenue
    for the Broadcast Communications segment decreased
    17 percent to $486 million in fiscal 2010 compared
    with $584 million in fiscal 2009, and was $643 million
    in fiscal 2008. The segment had an operating loss of
    $30.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared with an operating
    loss of $238.0 million in fiscal 2009, which included a
    $255.5 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill
    and other long-lived assets, and operating income of
    $33.8 million in fiscal 2008. The Broadcast Communications
    segment contributed 9 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2010 compared with 11 percent in fiscal 2009 and
    14 percent in fiscal 2008. The percentage of this
    segment’s revenue that was derived outside of the United
    States was approximately 56 percent in fiscal 2010 compared
    with 47 percent in fiscal 2009 and 47 percent in
    fiscal 2008. No single customer accounted for more than
    3 percent of fiscal 2010 revenue for the Broadcast
    Communications segment.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through
    regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
    See “Item 1. Business — International
    Business” of this Report.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $260 million at July 2, 2010 compared with
    $247 million at July 3, 2009 and $305 million at
    June 27, 2008. We expect to fill approximately
    45 percent of this backlog during fiscal 2011, but we can
    give no assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, see “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Report.

International
    Business

Revenue from products exported from the United States (including
    foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad was
    $724.6 million (14 percent of our total revenue) in
    fiscal 2010 compared with $1,016.6 million (20 percent
    of our total revenue) in fiscal 2009 and $759.7 million
    (17 percent of our total revenue) in fiscal 2008.
    Essentially all of the international sales are derived from the
    RF Communications and Broadcast Communications segments. Direct
    export sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars,
    whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally
    denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Financial
    information regarding our domestic and international operations
    is contained in

Note 25: Business Segments

in the
    Notes and is incorporated herein by reference.

Our principal international manufacturing facilities are located
    in Canada and the United Kingdom. The majority of our
    international marketing activities are conducted through
    subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
    America, and Asia. We have also established international
    marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
    Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
    Registrant” of this Report for further information
    regarding our international subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
    distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
    sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
    and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
    for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the independent representative and may be above
    or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally
    receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those
    prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.
    Revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2010 represented
    6 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    35 percent of our international revenue, compared with
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2009 representing
    11 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    55 percent of our international revenue, and revenue



from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2008 representing
    7 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    44 percent of our international revenue.

Fiscal 2010 international revenue came from a large number of
    countries, and no such single country accounted for more than
    3 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are
    paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either
    on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments,
    progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or
    upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
    Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to
    provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in
    international markets, we also sometimes enter into recourse and
    vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain
    customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
    Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
    partially mitigated by the diversification of the international
    business and the protection provided by letters of credit and
    advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
    management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are product quality and reliability;
    technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability
    to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability
    to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party
    sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.
    Within the IT services market, there is intense competition
    among many companies. The ability to compete in the IT services
    market depends on a number of factors, including the capability
    to deploy skilled professionals at competitive prices across the
    diverse spectrum of the IT services market.

In the RF Communications segment, principal competitors include
    European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company N.V.
    (“EADS”), General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Motorola,
    Raytheon, Rohde & Schwarz, Selex, Tadiran and Thales.

In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal
    competitors include Boeing, CACI, General Dynamics, GTSI, L-3
    Communications, Lockheed Martin, ManTech, Northrop Grumman,
    Raytheon, RigNet, Rockwell Collins, Schlumberger Global
    Connectivity Services, SRA and SAIC. Consolidation among
    U.S. defense and aerospace companies has resulted in a
    reduction in the number of principal prime contractors. As a
    result of this consolidation, we frequently “partner”
    or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
    companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
    programs.

In the Broadcast Communications segment, principal competitors
    include Avid, Broadcast Electronics, Chyron, Evertz, EVS,
    Harmonic, Miranda, Nautel, NEC, Omnibus, Orad, Open Text, Pilat
    Media, Rohde & Schwarz, Sony Broadcast, Technicolor,
    Tektronix/Danaher, Thomson, Vizrt and Wide Orbit, as well as
    other smaller companies and divisions of large companies.

Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, were 76 percent of our total
    revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with 79 percent in both
    fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. No other customer accounted for
    more than 2 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2010.
    Additional information regarding customers for each of our
    segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment” of
    this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
    derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
    to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales of the
    Government Communications Systems segment are made directly or
    indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or
    subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses
    providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for
    termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or
    for default based upon performance.



These U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include
    both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of
    allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. Our
    cost-reimbursement contracts fall into three basic types:
    (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for the
    payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of
    performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which
    provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified
    limits, based upon actual results compared with contractual
    targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and
    delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts,
    which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the
    discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the
    contractor against pre-established performance criteria. Under
    cost-reimbursement contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for
    allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on
    contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially
    or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or
    regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs,
    lobbying costs, charitable contributions and certain litigation
    defense costs.

Our fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts
    or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under firm fixed-price
    contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a
    fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and
    carry the burden of cost overruns. Under fixed-price incentive
    contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings
    accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs as
    well as costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated
    ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), but carry
    the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling
    price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may
    also be adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified
    performance objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and
    fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually receive either
    milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract
    price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government
    in amounts equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the
    contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive
    fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items
    and deliverables under the contract. Fixed-price contracts
    generally have higher profit margins than cost-reimbursement
    contracts. Production contracts are mainly fixed-price
    contracts, and development contracts are generally
    cost-reimbursement contracts.

In fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, approximately
    38 percent, 36 percent and 35 percent,
    respectively, of the total combined revenue of our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments
    was from fixed-price contracts. GWAC and IDIQ contracts, which
    can include task orders for each contract type, require us to
    compete both for the initial contract and then for individual
    task or delivery orders under such contracts.

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for
    default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
    Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
    funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
    policies resulting from various military, political and
    international developments. Long-term government contracts and
    related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for
    subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under
    contracts terminable for the convenience of the
    U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
    payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
    proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
    Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
    the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
    and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
    of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
    In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
    complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
    difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
    developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
    many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
    facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD
    and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of
    risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $6,526 million at July 2, 2010 compared
    with approximately $6,317 million at July 3, 2009 and
    $5,883 million at June 27, 2008. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $3,250 million at
    July 2, 2010 compared with approximately
    $2,315 million at July 3, 2009 and $2,123 million
    at June 27, 2008. The determination of backlog involves
    substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer
    requirements contracts and development and production contracts
    of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

In fiscal 2010, we changed how we define funded backlog to be
    more consistent with industry practices. This change of
    methodology, which we applied retrospectively, had no impact on
    our total backlog, but did result in a reclassification of
    certain amounts of backlog from unfunded backlog to funded
    backlog for prior periods presented in this Report. We now
    define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and
    services for which funding



has been authorized and, in the case of U.S. Government
    agencies, appropriated. We define unfunded backlog as primarily
    unfilled firm contract value for which funding has not yet been
    authorized or, in the case of U.S. Government agencies,
    appropriated, including the value of contract options in cases
    of material contracts that have options we believe are probable
    of being exercised. We do not include potential task or delivery
    orders under IDIQ contracts in our backlog. In fiscal 2011, we
    expect to fill approximately 75 percent of our total funded
    backlog as of July 2, 2010. However, we can give no
    assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will
    become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is
    subject to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are
    beyond our control. Additional information with regard to the
    backlog of each of our segments is provided under
    “Item 1. Business — Description of Business
    by Segment” of this Report.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $1,047 million in fiscal 2010,
    $1,003 million in fiscal 2009 and $980 million in
    fiscal 2008. Company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which included research and development for commercial
    products and independent research and development related to
    government products and services, as well as concept formulation
    studies and bid and proposal efforts, were approximately
    $326 million in fiscal 2010, $244 million in fiscal
    2009 and $248 million in fiscal 2008. A portion of our
    independent research and development costs are allocated among
    contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government
    contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored research and product
    development costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense
    when incurred. The portion of total research, development and
    engineering expenditures that was not company-sponsored was
    funded by the U.S. Government and is included in our
    revenue. Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $721 million in fiscal 2010, $759 million in fiscal
    2009 and $732 million in fiscal 2008. Company-sponsored
    research is directed to the development of new products and to
    building technological capability in selected communications and
    electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research
    helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. All of
    our segments maintain their own engineering and new product
    development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
    advanced-technology departments. As of July 2, 2010, we
    employed approximately 7,000 engineers and scientists and are
    continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
    our business segments available for all other business segments.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the
    aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large and
    valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how,
    confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other
    intellectual property. We also license intellectual property to
    and from third parties. As of July 2, 2010, we held
    approximately 1,075 U.S. patents and 645 foreign patents,
    and had approximately 550 U.S. patent applications pending
    and 1,260 foreign patent applications pending. Unpatented
    research, development and engineering skills also make an
    important contribution to our business. While our intellectual
    property rights in the aggregate are important to our business
    and the operations of our business segments, we do not consider
    our business or any business segment to be materially dependent
    upon any single patent, license or other intellectual property
    right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other
    intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a proactive
    patent licensing program and have entered into a number of
    licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate
    royalty income. Although existing license agreements have
    generated income in past years and may do so in the future,
    there can be no assurances we will enter into additional
    income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage
    in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual
    property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks,
    copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive
    advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to
    intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report. With regard to patents relating to
    our Government Communications Systems segment, the
    U.S. Government often has an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
    royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government
    may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by
    such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the
    U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions
    covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks
    used on or in connection with our products are also considered
    to be a valuable asset.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic
    and international laws and regulations designed to protect the
    environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions.
    The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common
    within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve.
    We believe that we have complied with these requirements and
    that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Based upon currently available information, we do not expect



expenditures over the next several years to protect the
    environment and to comply with current environmental laws and
    regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending
    climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords,
    to have a material impact on our competitive position or
    financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such
    expenditures will not exceed current expectations. If future
    treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent
    requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may
    be higher than our present estimates of those expenditures. We
    have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control
    equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste
    minimization and prevention goals. We did not spend material
    amounts on environmental capital projects in fiscal 2010, fiscal
    2009 or fiscal 2008. A portion of our environmental expenditures
    relates to discontinued operations for which we have retained
    certain environmental liabilities. We currently expect that
    amounts to be spent for environmental-related capital projects
    will not be material in fiscal 2011. These amounts may increase
    in future years. Additional information regarding environmental
    and regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” of this Report and in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Broadcast Communications segment, in particular, is subject
    to domestic and international requirements requiring

end-of-life

management

and/or

restricting materials in products delivered to customers,
    including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and
    Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of certain
    Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted
    similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not
    applicable to most equipment produced by our Government
    Communications Systems and RF Communications segments. We
    believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations,
    where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold
    into such jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations with respect to our future products.

Broadcast and wireless communications (whether TV, radio,
    satellite or telecommunications) are also subject to
    governmental regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast
    Communications and RF Communications segments, in particular, is
    subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid
    interference among users of radio and television frequencies and
    to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment.
    Additionally, our managed satellite communications services
    business holds licenses for very small aperture terminals
    (“VSATs”) and satellite earth stations, which
    authorize operation of networks and teleports. We are also
    required to comply with technical operating and licensing
    requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and
    operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products
    and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and
    services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum
    also could impact our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Raw
    Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
    as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
    numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
    electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
    plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
    dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
    of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
    and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
    restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
    and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
    one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
    of a particular item or because of local content preference
    requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
    While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
    of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
    materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
    materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced
    component shortages from vendors as a result of the RoHS
    environmental regulations in the European Union or similar
    regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations may cause
    a spike in demand for certain electronic components (such as
    lead-free components), resulting in

industry-wide

supply chain shortages. To date, these component shortages have
    not had a material adverse effect on our business. For further
    discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers,
    see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    contract awards and the timing and availability of
    U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product
    deliveries and customer acceptance.



Employees

We employed approximately 15,800 employees at the end of
    fiscal 2010 compared with approximately 15,400 employees at
    the end of fiscal 2009. Approximately 91 percent of our
    employees as of the end of fiscal 2010 were located in the
    United States. A significant number of employees in our
    Government Communications Systems segment possess a
    U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a
    number of independent contractors. None of our employees in the
    United States is represented by a labor union. In certain
    international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by
    workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we
    believe that our relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that we
    believe could impact our business and future results in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this
    Report. In addition, our business, operating results, cash flows
    and financial condition are subject to, and could be materially
    adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties,
    including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of
    which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
    recent results or our anticipated future results.

We
    depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of
    our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding priorities could have adverse
    consequences on our future business.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government
    customers. The percentage of our net revenue that was derived
    from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, was approximately
    76 percent in fiscal 2010 and 79 percent in both
    fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Therefore, any significant
    disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the
    U.S. Government would significantly reduce our revenue. Our
    U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed
    by other government contractors for limited resources and for
    uncertain levels of funding. Our competitors continuously engage
    in efforts to expand their business relationships with the
    U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
    future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other
    contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we
    seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through
    competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly
    relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to a
    competitive bidding process, including IDIQ, GWAC, GSA Schedule



and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater
    competition and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly
    competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive
    or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to
    continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain
    task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the
    competitive bidding process involves significant cost and
    managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that
    may not be awarded to us, and the risk that we may fail to
    accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill
    any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, we may
    experience significant expense or delay, contract modification
    or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting
    or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding.
    We also compete with the U.S. Government’s own
    capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers.
    Budget decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of
    our control and have long-term consequences for our business. A
    shift in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase
    in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs (for
    example, through “in-sourcing”), or a reduction in
    total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse
    consequences on our future business.

We
    depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often
    are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and
    heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to
    fund one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact
    on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
    implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
    and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
    is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
    contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with
    major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a
    fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made
    available for obligation over the course of three years.
    Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
    initially, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress
    authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding
    for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
    anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which
    could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
    termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
    funds to a program that already has been started could result in
    lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such
    audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any
    costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract
    will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must
    be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs
    we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know
    the outcome of any future audits and adjustments and we may be
    required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon
    completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit
    findings could also result in termination of a contract,
    forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
    suspension or prohibition from doing business with the
    U.S. Government.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain
    provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without
    prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon
    the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time
    of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our
    U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
    these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
    would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
    backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
    U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
    our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
    our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
    large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
    regulations and a variety of socio-economic and other
    requirements. These requirements, although customary in
    U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and
    compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future,
    thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect
    on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these
    regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or
    debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
    subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
    debarment are violations of various laws, including those
    related to procurement integrity, export control,
    U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
    protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper
    recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
    U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
    of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
    could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for
    future U.S. Government contracts.



We
    enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses
    in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in
    inflation.

We have a number of firm fixed-price contracts. In fiscal 2010
    and fiscal 2009, approximately 38 percent and
    36 percent, respectively, of the total combined revenue of
    our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
    segments was from fixed-price contracts. These contracts allow
    us to benefit from cost savings, but they carry the risk of
    potential cost overruns because we assume all of the cost
    burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose
    money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can
    expose us to potentially large losses because the
    U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a
    project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of
    its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or
    foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of
    the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new
    technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen
    events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the
    price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost
    overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less
    favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. The United
    States also may experience a significant increase in inflation.
    A significant increase in inflation rates could have a
    significant adverse impact on the profitability of these
    contracts. Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or
    specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less
    favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated
    damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its
    right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have
    provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we
    fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not
    realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are
    dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our
    contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our
    financial results. The potential impact of such risk on our
    financial results would increase if the mix of our contracts and
    programs shifted toward a greater percentage of firm fixed-price
    contracts.

We
    derive a significant portion of our revenue from international
    operations and are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
    States. In fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, revenue
    from products exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad
    was 14 percent, 20 percent and 17 percent,
    respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
    41 percent of our international business in fiscal 2010 was
    transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency
    rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect
    that international revenue will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant
    portion of our international revenue is in less-developed
    countries. We are subject to risks of doing business
    internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using international dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

Our
    reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the
    improper conduct of our employees, agents or business
    partners.

We have implemented extensive compliance controls, policies and
    procedures designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from
    being committed by our employees, agents or business partners
    that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we
    operate, including laws governing payments to government
    officials (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and to
    detect any such reckless or criminal acts committed. We cannot
    ensure, however, that our controls, policies and procedures will
    prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts. If not
    prevented, such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to
    civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary



penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our
    ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our
    reputation.

We may
    not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to
    conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent
    proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and
    authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before
    we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies
    outside of the United States. For example, the
    U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least

15-60 days,

depending on the size and location of the sale, prior to
    authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to
    foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action
    to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we
    will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary
    licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or
    delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability
    to sell products or technologies outside of the United States
    could negatively impact our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our
    future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized
    by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry
    standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of
    factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target
    markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Develop, manufacture and bring cost-effective offerings to
    market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
    we will need to continue to develop new products and
    technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial
    resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our
    attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be
    sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely
    development of new products or technologies. Due to the design
    complexity of some of our products and technologies, we may
    experience delays in completing development and introducing new
    products or technologies in the future. Any delays could result
    in increased costs of development or redirect resources from
    other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that
    the markets for our products or technologies will develop as we
    currently anticipate. The failure of our products or
    technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly
    reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot
    be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products
    or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our
    products or technologies, or that our competitors will not
    develop new products or technologies that cause our existing
    products or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete,
    which could adversely affect our results of operations. The
    future direction of the domestic and global economies, including
    its impact on customer demand, also will have a significant
    impact on our overall performance.

We
    participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and
    expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are
    subject to uncertain economic conditions. As a result, it is
    difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in
    which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting
    and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the
    markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of future
    income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may
    make significant investments and expenditures but never realize
    the anticipated benefits.

We
    cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events,
    but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate,
    our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our
    profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in the Middle East and
    Asia and the potential for further conflicts and future
    terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events
    throughout the world have created economic and political
    uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operations and profitability. These matters cause
    uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance markets
    and may increase significantly the political, economic and
    social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate.
    These matters also have caused the premiums charged for our
    insurance coverages to increase and may cause further increases
    or some coverages to be unavailable altogether.



We
    have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that
    involve significant risks and uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions,
    including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or
    fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other
    acquisition risks;

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    strategic acquisitions do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

Disputes
    with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors
    to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our
    components, parts or services, could cause our products or
    services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or
    unsatisfactory manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. We may have
    disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding
    the quality and timeliness of work performed by the
    subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our
    failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders
    under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a
    subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor’s failure
    to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain
    parts, components and services for many of our products and
    services which we source from other manufacturers or vendors.
    Some of our suppliers, from time to time, experience financial
    and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to
    supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that
    we require. Any inability to develop alternative sources of
    supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially
    impair our ability to manufacture and deliver products and
    services to our customers. We can give no assurances that we
    will be free from disputes with our subcontractors, material
    supply problems or component, subsystems or services problems in
    the future. Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not
    be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials,
    components, subsystems and services they supply, which might
    result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty
    claims and could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
    protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
    often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be
    infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon
    those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual
    property infringement might also require us to enter into costly
    royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to
    obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us,
    or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or
    injunctions against development and sale of certain of our
    products. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary
    technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions
    and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our
    intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully protect
    and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer.
    Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may
    not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or
    scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition,
    our patents may not provide us a significant competitive
    advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to
    monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not
    be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may
    be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design
    around our technology or develop competing technologies.

The
    outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is
    unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and, from
    time to time, are involved in a number of arbitrations. These
    actions may divert financial and management resources that would
    otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can
    be given that the results of these or new matters will be
    favorable to us. An



adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We
    face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
    and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
    relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
    defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
    associated with these systems and products may be untested or
    unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
    products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
    satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems,
    homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
    to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
    circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
    risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
    to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
    substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
    possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
    risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
    incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
    insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for
    which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively
    affect our standing among our customers and the public, thereby
    making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
    could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
    insurance in the future.

Changes
    in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a
    number of factors including:

•

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax
    returns;

•

Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes,
    including write-offs of acquired in-process research and
    development and impairment of goodwill in connection with
    acquisitions;

•

Changes in available tax credits;

•

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the
    interpretation of such tax laws; and

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
    tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

The
    effects of the recent recession in the United States and general
    downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on
    our business, operating results or financial
    condition.

The United States economy has recently experienced a recession
    and there has been a general downturn in the global economy.
    Although governments worldwide, including the
    U.S. Government, have initiated sweeping economic plans, we
    are unable to predict the impact, severity and duration of these
    economic events. The continuing effects of the recent recession
    or a worsening of economic conditions could have an adverse
    impact on our business, operating results or financial condition
    in a number of ways. Possible effects of these economic events
    include the following:

•

The U.S. Government could reprioritize its spending away
    from the government programs in which we participate;

•

We may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash
    flows as a result of reduced orders, payment delays or other
    factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and
    prospective customers (including U.S. state and local
    governments);

•

We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other
    problems associated with financial constraints faced by our
    suppliers and subcontractors; and

•

We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with
    future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit
    facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing
    our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or
    financing activities.

We
    have significant operations in Florida and other locations that
    could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a
    natural disaster or other significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
    Government Communications Systems segment are located in
    Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Our worldwide
    operations could be subject to natural



disasters or other significant disruptions, including
    hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires,
    water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical
    epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts,
    telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and
    manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural
    disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or
    interruptions to our operations or the operations of our
    suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers;
    destruction of facilities;

and/or

loss
    of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and
    expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We
    could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber
    attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant
    disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we
    operate for certain of our customers.

We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach,
    whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the
    Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to

e-mails,

persons inside our organization, or with persons with access to
    systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption
    of our IT networks and related systems. We face an added risk of
    a security breach or other significant disruption of the IT
    networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate
    and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve
    managing and protecting information relating to national
    security and other sensitive government functions. The risk of a
    security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack
    or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign
    governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number,
    intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions
    from around the world have increased. As a communications and IT
    company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a
    heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats
    to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’
    proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and
    related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that
    we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These
    types of information and IT networks and related systems are
    critical to the operation of our business and essential to our
    ability to perform

day-to-day

operations, and in some cases are critical to the operations of
    certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts
    to maintain the security and integrity of these types of
    information and IT networks and related systems, and we have
    implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security
    breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our
    security efforts and measures will be effective or that
    attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be
    successful or damaging. Even the most well protected
    information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially
    vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly
    cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the
    future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are
    constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until
    launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be
    detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may
    be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement
    adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and
    thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this
    risk. A security breach or other significant disruption
    involving these types of information and IT networks and related
    systems could:

•

Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and
    therefore our operations

and/or

those
    of certain of our customers;

•

Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss,
    theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential,
    sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our
    customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to
    compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise
    harmful purposes and outcomes;

•

Compromise national security and other sensitive government
    functions;

•

Require significant management attention and resources to remedy
    the damages that result;

•

Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits,
    penalties or termination; or

•

Damage our reputation among our customers (particularly agencies
    of the U.S. Government and potential customers of our Cyber
    Integrated Solutions business) and the public generally,

Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We
    rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our
    managed satellite communications services, and any bandwidth
    constraints could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

In our managed satellite communications services business, we
    compete for satellite bandwidth with other commercial entities,
    such as other satellite communications services providers and
    broadcasting companies, and with governmental entities, such as
    the military. In certain markets and at certain times, satellite
    bandwidth may be limited

and/or

pricing of satellite bandwidth could be subject to competitive
    pressure. In such cases, we may be



unable to secure sufficient bandwidth needed to provide our
    managed satellite communications services, either at favorable
    rates or at all. This inability could harm our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in future business conditions could cause business investments
    and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in
    substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results
    of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence
    procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic
    objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions
    and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately 33 percent of our recorded total assets as of
    July 2, 2010. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded
    goodwill amounts annually, as well as when we change reporting
    segments and when events or circumstances indicate there may be
    an impairment. The annual impairment test is based on several
    factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected
    reporting segment cash flows or changes in market conditions may
    indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. For
    additional information on accounting policies we have in place
    for goodwill impairment, see our discussion under “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations” of this Report and

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

We
    must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so
    could seriously harm us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract significant
    numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding
    security clearances, to support our growth and to replace
    individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or
    for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified
    personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time
    in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or
    training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or
    could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts
    if our needs for such employees were unmet.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
    in Melbourne, Florida. As of July 2, 2010, we operated
    approximately 138 locations in the United States, Canada,
    Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
    7.5 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
    research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
    space, of which approximately 5.1 million square feet were
    owned and approximately 2.4 million square feet were
    leased. There are no material encumbrances on any of our
    facilities. Our leased facilities are, for the most part,
    occupied under leases for remaining terms ranging from one month
    to 10 years, a majority of which can be terminated or
    renewed at no longer than five-year intervals at our option. As
    of July 2, 2010, we had major operations at the following
    locations:

RF Communications

— Rochester, New York;
    Henrietta, New York; Lynchburg, Virginia; Forest, Virginia;
    Chelmsford, Massachusetts; and Columbia, Maryland.

Government Communications Systems

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
    leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
    and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
    While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
    not considered significant. The facilities owned by our RF
    Communications segment include a recently acquired manufacturing
    facility located in Henrietta, New York that, as of July 2,
    2010, was undergoing construction for anticipated use beginning
    in early fiscal 2012. We frequently review our anticipated
    requirements for facilities and will, from time to time, acquire
    additional facilities, expand existing facilities, and dispose
    of existing facilities or parts thereof, as management deems
    necessary. For more information about our lease obligations, see

Note 18: Lease Commitments

in the Notes. Our
    facilities and other properties are generally maintained in good
    operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal
    incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are,
    and were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and
    litigation or arbitration is commenced by or against us arising
    from or related to matters, including, but not limited to:
    product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks, trade
    secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee
    disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
    products containing asbestos or other restricted materials;
    breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed amounts
    against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable
    relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any
    real risk of court or arbitral awards. We record accruals for
    losses related to those matters against us that we consider to
    be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
    contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
    legal costs generally are expensed when incurred. While it is
    not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
    certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
    disposed of or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
    information, in the opinion of management, settlements,
    arbitration awards and final judgments, if any, which are
    considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation
    or arbitration in existence at July 2, 2010 are reserved
    against, covered by insurance or would not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

U.S. Government
    Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such
    as us, are engaged in supplying goods and services to the
    U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore
    dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
    allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
    U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government contracts
    typically involve long lead times for design and development,
    are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
    may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the
    U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
    design and production of complex and technologically advanced
    products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government as either a prime
    contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes
    may arise between the prime contractor and the
    U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
    subcontractors and may result in litigation or arbitration
    between the contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
    policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
    U.S. Government, and specific agency acquisition
    regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the
    Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations. As a
    U.S. Government contractor, our contract costs are audited
    and reviewed on a continuing basis by the Defense Contract Audit
    Agency (“DCAA”). The DCAA also reviews the adequacy
    of, and a U.S. Government contractor’s compliance
    with, the contractor’s internal control systems and
    policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property,
    estimating, compensation and management information systems. In
    addition to these routine audits, from time to time, we may,
    either individually or in conjunction with other
    U.S. Government contractors, be the subject of audits and
    investigations by other agencies of the U.S. Government.
    These audits and investigations are conducted to determine if
    our performance and administration of our U.S. Government
    contracts are compliant with applicable contractual requirements
    and procurement and other



applicable Federal laws and regulations. These investigations
    may be conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict
    the outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
    resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
    against us, our officers or employees. Under present
    U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, if
    indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement or other
    Federal laws, a contractor, such as us, or one or more of our
    operating divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines,
    penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain
    findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
    debarment from eligibility for awards of new
    U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension
    or debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because
    of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition,
    our export privileges could be suspended or revoked. Suspension
    or revocation of our export privileges also would have a
    material adverse effect on us. For further discussion of risks
    relating to U.S. Government contracts, see
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

International.

As an international company, we
    are, from time to time, the subject of investigations relating
    to our international operations, including under the
    U.S. export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous
    U.S. Federal, state and international environmental laws
    and regulatory requirements and are involved from time to time
    in investigations or litigation of various potential
    environmental issues concerning activities at our facilities or
    former facilities or remediation as a result of past activities
    (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From
    time to time, we receive notices from the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or
    international environmental agencies that we are a potentially
    responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”)

and/or

equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for
    cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us,
    sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances
    attributable to us from past operations. We own, previously
    owned or are currently named as a potentially responsible party
    at 14 such sites, excluding sites as to which our records
    disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been
    finally determined. While it is not feasible to predict the
    outcome of many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our
    management, any payments we may be required to make as a result
    of such claims in existence at July 2, 2010 will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows. Additional information regarding
    environmental matters is set forth in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes, which Note is
    incorporated herein by reference, and in “Item 1.
    Business — Environmental and Other Regulations”
    of this Report.

HSTX Securities Litigation.

HSTX and certain
    of its current and former officers and directors, including
    certain current Harris officers, were named as defendants in a
    federal securities class action complaint filed on
    September 15, 2008 in the United States District Court for
    the District of Delaware by plaintiff Norfolk County Retirement
    System on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of HSTX
    securities from January 29, 2007 to July 30, 2008,
    including shareholders of Stratex Networks, Inc.
    (“Stratex”) who exchanged shares of Stratex for shares
    of HSTX as part of the combination between Stratex and our
    former Microwave Communications Division to form HSTX.
    Similar complaints were filed in the United States District
    Court for the District of Delaware on October 6, 2008 and
    October 30, 2008. The complaints were consolidated in a
    slightly expanded complaint filed on July 29, 2009 that,
    among other things, added Harris Corporation as a defendant.
    This action relates to public disclosures made by HSTX on
    January 30, 2007 and July 30, 2008, which included the
    restatement of HSTX’s financial statements for the first
    three fiscal quarters of its fiscal 2008 (the quarters ended
    March 28, 2008, December 28, 2007 and
    September 28, 2007) and for its fiscal years ended
    June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005 due
    to accounting errors. The consolidated complaint alleged
    violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the
    Exchange Act and of

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, as well as violations of Section 11
    and Section 15 of the Securities Act, and sought, among
    other relief, determinations that the action is a proper class
    action, unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable
    attorneys’ fees and costs. We believe that the defendants
    have meritorious defenses to these actions and the defendants
    intend to defend the litigation vigorously.

Dividends

The cash dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in
    our last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
    August 28, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.22 per
    share to $.25 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $1.00 per share and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.25
    per share, which will be paid on September 17, 2010 to holders
    of record on September 8, 2010. Our annualized cash dividend
    rate was $.88 per share, $.80 per share and $.60 per share in
    fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively.
    Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June,
    September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends
    will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no
    assurances. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant.

Harris
    Stock Performance Graph

The following performance graph and table do not constitute
    soliciting material and the performance graph and table should
    not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other
    previous or future filings by us under the Securities Act or the
    Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically
    incorporate the performance graph and table by reference
    therein.

The performance graph and table below compare the five-year
    cumulative total return of our common stock with the comparable
    five-year cumulative total returns of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index (“S&P
    500”), the Standard & Poor’s 500 Information
    Technology Sector Index (“S&P 500 Information
    Technology”) and the Standard & Poor’s 500
    Aerospace & Defense Index (“S&P 500
    Aerospace & Defense”). The figures in the
    performance graph and table below assume an initial investment
    of $100 at the close of business on July 1, 2005 in Harris,
    the S&P 500, the S&P 500 Information Technology and
    the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense and the
    reinvestment of all dividends, including, with respect to our
    common stock, the Spin-off dividend. For purposes of calculating
    the cumulative total return of our common stock, the

then-current

market value of the HSTX shares distributed in the Spin-off was
    deemed to have been reinvested on the May 27, 2009 Spin-off
    date in shares of our common stock.

We have included the S&P 500 because we are a company
    within the S&P 500, and we have included the
    S&P 500 Information Technology as a relevant published
    industry index. In addition, we have included the
    S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense because we believe
    that this index is representative of certain other companies
    competing with us or otherwise participating in markets we
    serve, and therefore may also provide a fair basis for
    comparison with us and be relevant to an assessment of our
    performance.

    number of factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject

BUSINESS
    CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
    technology company serving government and commercial markets in
    more than 150 countries. We are dedicated to developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

®

products, systems and services for global markets. Our company
    generates revenue, income and cash flows by developing,
    manufacturing and selling communications products and software
    as well as providing related services. We sell directly to our
    customers, the largest of which are U.S. Government
    customers and their prime contractors, and we utilize agents and
    intermediaries to sell and market some products and services,
    especially in international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our continuing operations in the following
    three business segments:

•

Our RF Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Tactical Radio Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications businesses;



•

Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of our
    (i) Defense Programs, (ii) National Intelligence
    Programs, (iii) Civil Programs and (iv) IT Services
    businesses; and

•

Our Broadcast Communications segment, comprised of our
    (i) Workflow, Infrastructure and Networking Solutions,
    (ii) Media and (iii) Transmission Systems businesses.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a taxable pro rata
    dividend to our shareholders of all the shares of HSTX common
    stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting segment our
    former HSTX segment. Our historical financial results have been
    restated to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented in this Report, and unless otherwise
    specified, disclosures in this Report relate solely to our
    continuing operations. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

in the Notes for additional information regarding
    discontinued operations.

Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or

“Non-operating

income (loss)” line items in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements and accompanying Notes.

Value
    Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for Achieving
    Value

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
    Corporation will be the

best-in-class

global provider of mission-critical

assured
    communications

®

systems and services to both government and commercial
    customers, combining advanced technology and application
    knowledge.” We are committed to our mission statement, and
    we believe that executing our mission statement creates value.
    Consistent with this commitment to effective execution, we
    currently focus on these key value drivers:

•

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all segments by
    introducing new technology-based products, expanding our
    addressable markets and customer base, and investing in
    international markets and channels;

•

Leveraging technology transfer across business segments;

•

Achieving operating efficiencies and cost reductions by
    delivering on supply chain and operations excellence;

•

Making strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolios and to gain access to new
    markets; and

•

Maintaining an efficient capital structure.

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all
    segments:

We plan to focus on continued
    profitable revenue growth by focusing on the following
    strategies in each segment:

RF Communications:

Continue to leverage our
    reputation and position as a leading provider of secure tactical
    radio communications and embedded high-grade encryption
    solutions for military and government organizations and also of
    secure communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. Expand our market reach with
    new products and in adjacent markets.

Government Communications Systems:

Conduct
    advanced research studies and produce, integrate and support
    highly reliable, net-centric communications and information
    technology that solve the mission-critical challenges of our
    defense, intelligence and civilian U.S. Government
    customers. Leverage core capabilities such as SATCOM, ground
    systems, avionics, data links, mission-critical networks, ISR
    and space systems. Utilize IT Services business scale to address
    the growing government and commercial services markets. Identify
    and implement growth opportunities in new markets, including
    healthcare solutions, cyberspace and commercial managed
    services. Expand into international markets through joint
    ventures and strategic acquisitions.

Broadcast Communications:

Focus core
    operations on a few attractive market segments with high growth
    potential and more sustainable margins including: production,
    content management and channel launch. Invest in key
    international markets including Brazil, China, India and Russia,
    as well as other countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific and
    Africa where the transition from analog to digital is just
    beginning. Invest in new media initiatives such as digital

out-of-home

networks, sports and live-event venues, mobile handheld devices
    and full-motion video for government customers.

Leveraging technology transfer across business
    segments:

One of our strengths is our ability
    to transfer technology among segments and focus our research and
    development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole. An
    example of this is our FAME product that utilizes COTS software
    and hardware developed by our commercial Broadcast
    Communications segment and applying that technology to
    government applications where there is a need to gather, store,
    distribute and analyze increasingly large amounts of ISR data.
    Another area of focus is cross-selling through segment sales
    channels and joint pursuits by multiple segments. Other
    corporate initiatives include joint international market channel
    development, such as shared distributors and coordinated

“go-to-market”

strategies.



Achieving operating efficiencies and cost
    reductions:

Our principal focus areas for
    operating efficiencies and cost management are: reducing
    procurement costs through an emphasis on coordinated supply
    chain management; reducing product costs through dedicated
    engineering resources focused on product design; improving
    manufacturing efficiencies across all segments; and optimizing
    facility utilization.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another
    key value driver is effective capital allocation by making
    effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
    the strengths in our base businesses and to gain access to new
    markets. We believe acquisitions may also serve to balance and
    enhance our portfolio of businesses. On July 30, 2010,
    after the end of our fiscal 2010, we acquired privately held
    CapRock, a global provider of mission-critical, managed
    satellite communications services for the government, energy and
    maritime markets. CapRock’s

highly-reliable

solutions include broadband Internet access, VOIP telephony,
    wideband networking and real-time video, delivered to nearly
    2,000 customer sites around the world. The acquisition of
    CapRock increased the breadth of our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. We will report CapRock
    within our Government Communications Systems segment. In the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired SignaCert, which
    expanded our position as a leading provider of cyber solutions
    for U.S. Government and commercial customers, strengthened
    our cyber leadership team, brings discriminating technology to
    our cyber portfolio and better positions us to provide trusted,
    comprehensive solutions that address the national priority of
    enhancing critical cyber infrastructure. We report SignaCert
    within our Government Communications Systems segment. In the
    second quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired Patriot, which had
    about 100 employees and expanded our position as a leading
    provider of integrated and interoperable healthcare IT solutions
    for the U.S. Government market. Additionally, we believe
    this acquisition further positions us for providing a
    comprehensive solution addressing the national priority of
    integrating the VA and Military Health Systems. We report
    Patriot within our Government Communications Systems segment. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired Wireless Systems,
    Crucial and SolaCom ATC. Wireless Systems is an established
    provider of mission-critical wireless communications systems for
    law enforcement, fire and rescue, public service, utility and
    transportation markets. We report Wireless Systems, which we
    call the Public Safety and Professional Communications business,
    within our RF Communications segment. Crucial is a
    Washington, D.C.-area provider of mission-enabling
    engineering solutions that address both offensive and defensive
    IT security challenges for Federal law enforcement and other
    U.S. Government agencies. We report Crucial within our
    Government Communications Systems segment. SolaCom ATC provides
    voice and data communications systems and solutions for air
    traffic facilities and radio communications between in flight
    aircraft and air traffic controllers. We report SolaCom ATC
    within our Government Communications Systems segment. In recent
    years, we have also made several other acquisitions. In our
    Government Communications Systems segment, we acquired Multimax
    Incorporated (“Multimax”), which provided us greater
    scale, a broader customer base and new growth opportunities
    through key positions on GWACs in our IT Services business. In
    our Broadcast Communications segment, we acquired Encoda Systems
    Holdings, Inc. (“Encoda”), Leitch, Optimal Solutions,
    Inc. (“OSi”), Aastra Digital Video
    (“Aastra”) and Zandar Technologies plc
    (“Zandar”). These acquisitions helped us expand our
    product and service portfolios so we can offer

end-to-end

content delivery, transport and asset management solutions to
    our customers.

Maintaining an efficient capital
    structure:

Our capital structure is intended
    to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital
    position, access to key financial markets, ability to raise
    funds at a low effective cost and overall low cost of borrowing
    provide a competitive advantage. We had $455.2 million in
    cash and cash equivalents as of July 2, 2010 and had
    $802.7 million of cash flows provided by operating
    activities during fiscal 2010. Our cash is not restricted and
    can be used to make capital expenditures, make strategic
    acquisitions, repurchase our common stock or pay dividends to
    our shareholders. As of July 2, 2010, we have a remaining
    authorization to repurchase approximately $450 million in
    shares of our common stock under our repurchase program. Our
    repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. The
    level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors,
    including our financial condition, capital requirements, results
    of operations, future business prospects and other factors our
    Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, volume and
    nature of share repurchases are subject to market conditions,
    applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our
    discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
    Additional information regarding share repurchases during fiscal
    2010 and our repurchase program is set forth above under
    Part II. “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s
    Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Key
    Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
    key indicators of value such as: (1) income from continuing
    operations and income from continuing operations per diluted
    common share, (2) revenue, (3) gross margin,
    (4) income from continuing operations as a percentage of
    revenue, (5) net cash provided by operating activities,
    (6) return on average assets and (7) return on average
    equity. The measure of our success is reflected in our results
    of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators:



Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations Key
    Indicators:

Income from continuing
    operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common
    share, revenue, gross margin, and income from continuing
    operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements
    of our value drivers:

•

Income from continuing operations increased 79.8 percent to
    $561.6 million in fiscal 2010 from $312.4 million in
    fiscal 2009 (which included a $196.7 million after-tax
    non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets in our Broadcast Communications segment);

•

Income from continuing operations per diluted common share
    increased 83.7 percent to $4.28 in fiscal 2010 from $2.33
    in fiscal 2009 (which included a $1.48 per diluted share
    after-tax non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other
    long-lived assets in our Broadcast Communications segment);

•

Revenue increased 4.0 percent to $5.2 billion in
    fiscal 2010 from $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009;

•

Gross margin (revenue from product sales and services less cost
    of product sales and services) increased to 36.0 percent of
    revenue in fiscal 2010 from 31.7 percent of revenue in
    fiscal 2009; and

•

Income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue
    increased to 10.8 percent in fiscal 2010 from
    6.2 percent in fiscal 2009 (primarily due to the impairment
    charge in fiscal 2009 noted above).

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below
    in this Report for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key
    Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
    activities, return on average assets and return on average
    equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers:

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $802.7 million in fiscal 2010 from $666.8 million in
    fiscal 2009;

•

Return on average assets (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of total assets at
    the beginning and ending of the fiscal year) increased to
    12.2 percent in fiscal 2010 from 6.9 percent in fiscal
    2009 (primarily due to the impairment charge in fiscal 2009
    noted above); and

•

Return on average equity (defined as income from continuing
    operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the
    beginning and ending of the fiscal year) increased to
    27.7 percent in fiscal 2010 from 14.0 percent in
    fiscal 2009 (primarily due to the impairment charge in fiscal
    2009 noted above).

Refer to MD&A heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources
    and Financial Strategies” below in this Report for more
    information.

Industry-Wide
    Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Government Markets:

The DoD’s
    U.S. Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2011 budget
    proposal begins to implement the recommendations of the
    Quadrennial Defense Review to rebalance and reform the DoD to
    enhance future security and make the best use of taxpayer
    dollars. Specifically, the budget proposal is focused on
    identifying long-term strategic needs and targeting resources to
    its highest priorities, such as rebalancing U.S. forces to
    address both current and future conflicts, modernizing weapons
    systems, reforming the defense acquisition process and
    supporting troops in the field.

We expect the U.S. Government to remain committed to
    funding intelligence, information superiority, special
    operations and warfighter support.

The DoD’s GFY 2011 budget request is for approximately
    $708 billion, which is approximately 2.2% above GFY 2010
    enacted levels of $693 million. The GFY 2011 budget request
    includes $549 billion for base defense programs and
    $159 billion for overseas contingency operations
    (“OCO”).

The level of growth and budget amounts allocated to DoD
    procurement accounts (“Procurement”), along with
    research, development, test and evaluation
    (“RDT&E”) components of the DoD budget, also are
    an important indicator of spending. Including OCO funding, GFY
    2011 budget requests for Procurement and RDT&E of
    $137 billion and $77 billion, respectively, are
    comparable to GFY 2010 estimates for Procurement and RDT&E
    of $136 billion and $81 billion, respectively.
    Additionally, the DoD Operations and Maintenance account
    (“O&M”), which contains the bulk of funding for
    training, logistics, services and other logistical support, is a
    major account of importance. The DoD O&M budget request for
    GFY 2011, including funding for OCO, is $317 billion
    compared with the GFY 2010 estimate of $298 billion.



Another current funding priority for the U.S. Government is
    the security of the U.S., which includes better communications
    interplay among law enforcement, civil government agencies,
    intelligence agencies and our military services. Funding for
    investments in secure tactical communications, IT, information
    processing, healthcare IT, cyber security and additional
    communications assets and upgrades has remained solid. Another
    current priority of the U.S. Government is investments in
    productivity, cost reductions and upgrading to new IT systems
    and solutions. As a result, programs that promote these
    initiatives are also expected to receive funding, although there
    is no assurance that such funding will remain a priority. We
    provide products and services to a number of
    U.S. Government agencies including the FAA, NRO, NGA,
    Census Bureau, Department of State, NSA, NOAA and others. For
    example, the FAA has recently announced its NextGen project to
    transform the entire U.S. air transport system to meet
    future demands and avoid gridlock in the sky and at airports. We
    also provide products to Federal, state and local government
    agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and
    public safety. These agencies are upgrading their technologies
    to improve communications and interoperability.

International markets continue to drive toward tactical
    communications upgrades and interoperability with the systems
    and equipment used by the U.S. Government. We have also
    identified substantial opportunities with international
    governments with respect to their defense spending on national
    security and on tactical communications modernization and
    standardization programs, which we believe will positively
    affect our future orders, sales, income and cash flows.

Despite the recent overall slowing in the rate of growth of
    government spending and the cancellation of particular platforms
    and programs, the types of products and services we offer appear
    to be a funding priority over the long term, which we believe
    will positively affect our future orders, sales, income and cash
    flows. Conversely, a decline in government spending or a shift
    in funding priorities may have a negative effect on future
    orders, sales, income and cash flows depending on the platforms
    and programs affected by such budget reductions or shifts in
    funding priorities.

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to
    U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may
    investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with
    applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of
    those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could
    make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement
    regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a
    government contractor could result in that contractor being
    fined

and/or

suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new
    U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar
    government oversight exists in most other countries where we
    conduct business. We are currently not aware of any compliance
    audits or investigations that could result in a significant
    adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

We are also subject to other risks associated with
    U.S. Government business, including technological
    uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment
    of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are
    discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

Commercial Broadcast Market:

Continuing
    weakness in the global economy has adversely impacted capital
    spending by broadcast and media customers, especially in the U.S.

Trends and developments in the broadcast communications market
    include:

•

The transition from analog to digital transmission in North
    America is complete;

•

Internationally, there are significant growth opportunities, as
    the worldwide transition to digital and HD technologies is in
    various stages of implementation;

•

There is increasing demand for new systems to deliver rich media
    content in live sports and entertainment venues, retail
    establishments and to mobile handheld devices;

•

There are growth opportunities in full-motion video for
    government customers;

•

The market is transitioning from the traditional linear
    broadcast TV advertising model to

out-of-home

networks; and

•

There is a greater dependency on suppliers to provide
    systemization and integration support.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
    well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
    the market trends noted above in this Report. While we believe
    that some of these developments may temper near-term growth, we
    also expect they generally will have a longer-term positive
    impact on us. However, we remain subject to general economic
    conditions that could adversely affect our customers. We also
    remain subject to other risks associated with these markets,
    including technological uncertainties, changes in the Federal
    Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) regulations,
    slow market adoption of digital radio and DTV or any of our new
    products and other risks which are discussed below under
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
    Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Our revenue for fiscal 2010 was
    $5,206.1 million, an increase of 4.0 percent compared
    with fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal
    2010 was $561.6 million, an increase of 79.8 percent
    compared with fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations of
    $312.4 million. Fiscal 2010 revenue increased by
    17.4 percent in our RF Communications segment, and
    decreased by 0.8 percent and 16.7 percent in our
    Government Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications
    segments, respectively. Our RF Communications segment revenue
    benefited from our acquisition of Wireless Systems in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a decline in our
    Tactical Radio Communications business in fiscal 2010.
    Government Communications Systems segment revenue reflects the
    winding down of the FDCA program for the U.S. Census
    Bureau’s 2010 census that was mostly offset by growth from
    several new programs and growth initiatives. Revenue in our
    Broadcast Communications segment was impacted by continuing
    weakness in the U.S. broadcast market.

Fiscal 2010 income from continuing operations increased from
    fiscal 2009, primarily due to a $255.5 million
    ($196.7 million after-tax) non-cash charge recorded in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 for impairment of goodwill and
    other long-lived assets in our Broadcast Communications segment
    and strong operating results in our RF Communications and
    Government Communications Systems segments. Operating income
    increased in our RF Communications segment in fiscal 2010
    compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher operating
    margins in our Tactical Radio Communications business and our
    acquisition of Wireless Systems. Operating income increased in
    our Government Communications Systems segment in fiscal 2010
    compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to strong operating
    margins. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2009 included
    an $18.0 million charge for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs in fiscal 2009.

Additionally, our interest expense increased to
    $72.1 million in fiscal 2010 from interest expense of
    $52.8 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased
    borrowings related to our acquisition of Wireless Systems. In
    fiscal 2010, our effective tax rate (income taxes as a
    percentage of income from continuing operations before income
    taxes) was 33.2 percent compared with an effective tax rate
    of 35.6 percent in fiscal 2009.

See the “Interest Income and Interest Expense,”
    “Income Taxes” and “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussions below in this MD&A for further
    information.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our revenue for fiscal 2009 was
    $5,005.0 million, an increase of 8.9 percent compared
    with fiscal 2008. Income from continuing operations for fiscal
    2009 was $312.4 million, a decrease of 31.1 percent
    compared with fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations of
    $453.5 million. Fiscal 2009 revenue increased by
    16.8 percent and 9.3 percent in our RF Communications
    and Government Communications Systems segments, respectively,
    and decreased by 9.3 percent in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Our RF Communications segment revenue
    benefited from continued strength in international markets and
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems, while our Government
    Communications Systems segment revenue benefited from the
    ramping up of the FDCA program for the U.S. Census Bureau
    for the 2010 census and new program wins. The revenue decrease
    in our Broadcast Communications segment reflected lower demand,
    primarily due to the global recession and delays in capital
    spending by customers.



Fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations decreased from
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to a $255.5 million
    ($196.7 million after-tax) non-cash charge for impairment
    of goodwill and other long-lived assets in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Operating income increased in our RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments in
    fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase in our
    Government Communications Systems segment operating income was
    primarily due to lower charges for schedule and cost overruns on
    commercial satellite reflector programs in fiscal 2009
    ($18.0 million) than in fiscal 2008 ($75.9 million),
    the ramp up of the FDCA program and strong results on the FTI
    program.

Additionally, income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009
    was impacted by $28.6 million of charges, net of government
    cost reimbursement, for company-wide cost-reduction actions,
    primarily initiated in response to the global economic slowdown,
    pressure on DoD spending, and contract delays. Those charges
    were comprised of $24.1 million for severance and other
    employee-related exit costs and $4.5 million related to
    consolidation of facilities.

We had a fiscal 2009 non-operating loss of $3.1 million
    compared with fiscal 2008 non-operating income of
    $11.4 million. In fiscal 2009, our effective tax rate
    (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing
    operations before income taxes) was 35.6 percent compared
    with an effective tax rate of 32.1 percent in fiscal 2008.

See the “Non-Operating Income (Loss),” “Income
    Taxes” and “Discussion of Business Segments”
    discussions below in this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue
    (“gross margin percentage”) in fiscal 2010 was
    36.0 percent compared with 31.7 percent in fiscal
    2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due
    to an increase in the gross margin percentage in our RF
    Communications segment as a result of favorable product mix due
    to the U.S. military’s mine resistant ambush protected
    vehicle (“MRAP”) and mine resistant ambush protected
    all-terrain vehicle (“M-ATV”) programs and operational
    efficiencies, as well as a higher percentage of our overall
    sales that was generated by this higher-margin segment.
    Additionally, in fiscal 2010, a slightly lower gross margin
    percentage in our Broadcast Communications segment and a lower
    percentage of our overall sales that was generated by this
    higher-margin segment was mostly offset by an increase in the
    gross margin percentage in our Government Communications Systems
    segment. See the “Discussion of Business Segments”
    discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    essentially flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 at
    31.7 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with 31.6 percent
    in fiscal 2008. The slight increase in gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in gross
    margin as a percentage of revenue in our Government
    Communications Systems segment due to lower charges for schedule
    and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector programs
    incurred in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 and a larger
    mix of sales coming from our higher-margin RF Communications
    segment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. These positive
    impacts to gross margin as a percentage of revenue were almost
    entirely offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of
    revenue in our RF Communications segment in fiscal 2009 compared
    with fiscal 2008 and a lower mix of sales coming from our
    higher-margin Broadcast Communications segment in fiscal 2009
    compared with fiscal 2008. Additionally, in fiscal 2009, gross
    margin included $5.0 million of charges, net of government
    cost reimbursement, for cost-reduction actions. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative (“ESA”) expenses increased to
    $958.9 million in fiscal 2010 from $791.3 million in
    fiscal 2009. The increase in ESA expenses was primarily due to
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems. Additionally, ESA expenses
    in fiscal 2010 included $20.4 million of
    acquisition-related costs, compared with $8.9 million of
    acquisition-related costs incurred in fiscal 2009. These
    increases in ESA expenses were partially offset by the benefit
    of cost-reduction actions taken in fiscal 2009.

As a percentage of revenue, ESA expenses increased to
    18.4 percent in fiscal 2010 from 15.8 percent in
    fiscal 2009. The increase in ESA expenses as a percentage of
    revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of Wireless
    Systems, which has higher ESA expenses as a percentage of
    revenue compared with our other businesses. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below in
    this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in ESA expenses, were
    $325.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared with
    $243.5 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in
    company-sponsored research and product development costs was
    primarily due to our acquisition of Wireless Systems in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our ESA expenses increased to
    $791.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $746.5 million in
    fiscal 2008. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses
    decreased to 15.8 percent in fiscal 2009 from
    16.2 percent in fiscal 2008. The decrease in ESA expenses
    as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to revenue growth
    of 8.9 percent compared with total growth in ESA expenses
    of only 6.0 percent, primarily as a result of
    cost-reduction actions in our Broadcast Communications segment.
    The increase in total ESA expenses was primarily due to
    $23.6 million of charges for cost-reduction actions,
    $8.3 million of charges related to integration costs and a
    write-off of in-process research and development associated with
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems and a $4.1 million
    charge related to the Spin-off of HSTX. ESA expenses also
    increased due to higher sales and marketing expenses in our RF
    Communications segment in fiscal 2009 associated with our
    tactical radio systems products and the acquisition of Wireless
    Systems, partially offset by decreases in ESA expenses in our
    Government Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications
    segments in fiscal 2009. See the “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussion below in this MD&A for further
    information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in ESA expenses, were
    $243.5 million in fiscal 2009 compared with
    $248.0 million in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

We had a non-operating loss of
    $1.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared with a non-operating
    loss of $3.1 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower costs related to intellectual property
    litigation incidental to our business.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

We had a non-operating loss of
    $3.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared with non-operating
    income of $11.4 million in fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009
    non-operating loss was primarily due to a $7.6 million
    write-down of our investment in AuthenTec, Inc.
    (“AuthenTec”), recorded in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009, to reflect an

other-than-temporary

impairment, partially offset by a $7.5 million gain on the
    sale of certain non-strategic patents in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 non-operating income primarily resulted
    from a $5.6 million gain related to

mark-to-market

adjustments on warrants we held to acquire shares of



AuthenTec, which were classified as derivatives, and gains of
    $9.8 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in
    AuthenTec. See

    $1.5 million in fiscal 2010 from $3.2 million in
    fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower interest rates applicable to
    our balances of cash and cash equivalents. Our interest expense
    increased to $72.1 million in fiscal 2010 from interest
    expense of $52.8 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to
    increased borrowings related to our acquisition of Wireless
    Systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our interest income decreased to
    $3.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $5.2 million in
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our
    balances of cash and cash equivalents. Our interest expense of
    $52.8 million in fiscal 2009 was essentially flat with
    interest expense of $53.1 million in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Our effective tax rate (income taxes as
    a percentage of income from continuing operations before income
    taxes) was 33.2 percent in fiscal 2010 compared with
    35.6 percent in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, our effective
    tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate,
    primarily due to a $3.5 million state income tax benefit
    associated with the filing of our income tax returns, which we
    recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009,
    our effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory
    income tax rate, primarily due to the non-deductibility of a
    significant portion of the $255.5 million non-cash charge
    for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets in our
    Broadcast Communications segment recorded in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2009, largely offset by: a $3.3 million tax
    benefit that we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009
    when legislative action restored the U.S. Federal income
    tax credit for research and development expenses for fiscal
    2008; a $3.7 million state tax benefit in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the filing of our tax returns;
    and a $6.5 million favorable impact recorded in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009 from the settlement of the
    U.S. Federal income tax audit of fiscal year 2007. See

Note 23: Income Taxes

in the Notes for further
    information.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Our effective tax rate (income taxes as
    a percentage of income from continuing operations before income
    taxes) was 35.6 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with
    32.1 percent in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, our effective
    tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate
    for the same reasons noted above regarding fiscal 2010 compared
    with fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate was
    lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due
    to an $11 million favorable impact from the settlement of
    U.S. Federal income tax audits of fiscal years 2004 through
    2006. Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    began recording state income taxes in our Consolidated Statement
    of Income as ESA expenses to the extent such state taxes are
    reimbursed under government contracts, which totaled
    $9.9 million for fiscal 2008. Under U.S. Government
    regulations, these state income taxes are allowable costs in
    establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the
    U.S. Government. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2008,
    these state income taxes were recorded in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income as income taxes. The reimbursement of these
    state income taxes is recorded in our Consolidated Statement of
    Income as revenue for all periods presented. As a result of this
    change,



we reduced total income tax expense by approximately
    $6.4 million in fiscal 2008. See

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 17.4 percent and operating income increased
    23.8 percent from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenue was 34.2 percent in
    fiscal 2010 compared with 32.5 percent in fiscal 2009.
    Revenue in fiscal 2010 included $1,573.2 million in our
    Tactical Radio Communications business and $494.0 million
    in our Public Safety and Professional Communications business.
    Revenue growth in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was
    driven by our acquisition of Wireless Systems in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a decline in total
    tactical radio sales.

In spite of the recent decline in the total tactical radio
    market, our tactical radio sales increased in the
    U.S. market due to continued customer adoption of our
    next-generation Falcon III radios, as well as equipping a
    significant number of the U.S. military’s MRAPs and
    M-ATVs with Falcon
    II

®

and Falcon III radios. In the international market, our
    tactical radio sales declined in fiscal 2010 compared with
    fiscal 2009 primarily due to a delay in shipments as a result of
    the high priority of the U.S. MRAP and M-ATV programs.
    However, international orders in fiscal 2010 were strong,
    signaling growing international demand.

The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher
    operating margins in our Tactical Radio Communications business
    and our acquisition of Wireless Systems. Additionally, we
    incurred a $19.3 million charge associated with our
    acquisition of Wireless Systems in fiscal 2010 compared with
    $9.5 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in operating
    income as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by
    favorable product mix as a result of the
    U.S. military’s MRAP and M-ATV programs,
    cost-reduction actions implemented in the second half of fiscal
    2009 and operational efficiencies.

Orders for this segment were $2.88 billion for fiscal 2010
    compared with $1.25 billion for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010
    orders included $2.34 billion in our Tactical Radio
    Communications business and $541 million in our Public
    Safety and Professional Communications business. At the end of
    the fourth quarter, total backlog in our RF Communications
    segment was $1.76 billion, including $1.24 billion in
    our Tactical Radio Communications business and $527 million
    in our Public Safety and Professional Communications business.

This segment derived 66 percent of its revenue from
    U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, in fiscal 2010 compared with
    79 percent in fiscal 2009. The decrease in the percent of
    revenue from U.S. Government customers was primarily due to
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 16.8 percent and operating income increased
    8.8 percent from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Operating
    income as a percentage of revenue was 32.5 percent in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 34.9 percent in fiscal 2008.
    Revenue growth in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was
    primarily driven by significantly higher international sales and
    our acquisition of Wireless Systems, partially offset by a
    decline in the U.S. market. International tactical radio
    sales increased 66.2 percent from fiscal 2008 levels and
    represented 40 percent of total tactical radio revenue in
    fiscal 2009 compared with 27 percent of total tactical
    radio revenue in fiscal 2008.

The decline in the U.S. market was a result of a
    combination of factors. Pressure on DoD budgets caused by the
    global economic crisis and deficit spending slowed DoD
    procurements for many defense products and systems, including
    tactical radios for modernization programs. For us, the slower
    procurement environment was compounded by reduced urgency for
    radio systems to support operational requirements in Iraq, which
    was partially offset by additional requirements for Afghanistan.



In the international market, demand remained robust and
    continued to drive significant international revenue growth. We
    provide Falcon tactical radios to more than 100 countries.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we saw a rebound in DoD
    orders. Our RF Communications segment benefited from positive
    long-term market trends, a very strong competitive position and
    an industry-leading new product portfolio. For example, the
    Falcon III 117G manpack radio is the first JTRS-approved
    tactical radio system that provides wideband mobile ad-hoc
    networked communications. The radio has been fielded by all
    military branches of the DoD and several international allies.
    The radio supports secure, high-bandwidth

on-the-move

communications, delivering an evolving picture of the
    battlefield in real time.

On May 29, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the
    assets of Wireless Systems (formerly known as

M/A-COM),

an
    established provider of mission-critical wireless communications
    systems for law enforcement, fire and rescue, public service,
    utility and transportation markets. In connection with the
    acquisition, we assumed liabilities primarily related to
    Wireless Systems. We did not assume the State of New York
    wireless network contract awarded to Wireless Systems in
    December 2004. We call Wireless Systems our Public Safety and
    Professional Communications business. We believe the acquisition
    created a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market and greatly accelerated our entry into that
    market. Our fiscal 2009 results of operations reflected five
    weeks of operating results of the newly acquired Public Safety
    and Professional Communications business, representing the
    period subsequent to the acquisition. For further information
    related to the acquisition, including the allocation of the
    purchase price and pro forma results as if the acquisition had
    taken place as of the beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 4: Business Combinations

in the Notes.

The decline in operating income as a percentage of revenue was
    primarily driven by a decline in gross margin percentage as a
    result of higher sales of lower margin products and
    $8.1 million of charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2009 for cost-reduction actions. Additionally, we incurred
    $9.5 million of transaction-related costs in connection
    with our acquisition of Wireless Systems including the write-off
    of in-process research and development ($7.0 million), the
    impact of a

step-up

in
    inventory ($1.1 million) and integration costs
    ($1.4 million).

Orders for this segment were $1.25 billion for fiscal 2009
    compared with $1.68 billion for fiscal 2008. This segment
    derived 79 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian
    agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the
    U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
    contractors, in fiscal 2009 compared with 82 percent in
    fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue decreased slightly from fiscal 2009 revenue, and
    operating income increased 11.3 percent from fiscal 2009 to
    fiscal 2010. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was
    12.5 percent in fiscal 2010 compared with 11.2 percent
    in fiscal 2009. Revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009
    declined as the FDCA program for the U.S. Census Bureau for
    the 2010 census nears completion and the revenue from this
    program will continue to decline in fiscal 2011. The
    $238 million decline in revenue from the FDCA program in
    fiscal 2010 was mostly offset by increased revenue in fiscal
    2010 from the following programs: the GOES-R GS weather program
    for NOAA, the MET program for the U.S. Army, the IT
    services relocation program for the USSOUTHCOM, the FTI program,
    the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the U.S. Air Force
    NETCENTS program, the WIN-T program, and from recent
    acquisitions primarily related to our Cyber Integrated Solutions
    and Healthcare Solutions businesses.

The increases in operating income and operating income as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009
    were primarily due to excellent award fees and overall program
    execution across the segment, partially offset by a
    $6.8 million charge in fiscal 2010 for integration and
    other costs associated with our acquisitions of Crucial, SolaCom
    ATC, Patriot, SignaCert and CapRock. Additionally, operating
    income in fiscal 2009 included an $18.0 million charge for
    schedule and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector
    programs.



In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired Patriot, which
    has about 100 employees and expanded our position as a
    leading provider of integrated and interoperable healthcare IT
    solutions for the U.S. Government market. Additionally, we
    believe this acquisition further positions us for providing a
    comprehensive solution addressing the national priority of
    integrating the VA and Military Health Systems.

On July 30, 2010, after the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    acquired privately held CapRock, a global provider of
    mission-critical managed satellite communications services for
    the government, energy and maritime markets. CapRock’s
    highly-reliable solutions include broadband Internet access,
    VOIP telephony, wideband networking and real-time video,
    delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around the world. The
    acquisition of CapRock increased the breadth of our assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The purchase price for
    CapRock was $525 million in cash, subject to possible
    post-closing upward or downward adjustment. For calendar year
    2009, CapRock had revenue of $359 million and operating
    income of $28 million.

Orders for this segment were $2.7 billion for fiscal 2010
    and fiscal 2009. This segment derived 96 percent of its
    revenue from U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, for both fiscal 2010 and
    fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 9.3 percent and operating income
    increased 34.0 percent from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenue was
    11.2 percent in fiscal 2009 compared with 9.1 percent
    in fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008
    increased in all four of the segment’s businesses (Defense
    Programs, National Intelligence Programs, Civil Programs and IT
    Services), and was primarily driven by a further ramping up of
    the FDCA program for the U.S. Census Bureau for the 2010
    census and classified programs for our national intelligence
    customers. In addition to revenue growth from the FDCA and
    national intelligence customer programs, significant
    contributions to increased revenue in fiscal 2009 came from: the
    CBSP for the U.S. Navy; sales of surveillance equipment;
    the Global Geospatial Intelligence (“GGI”) program for
    the NGA; and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Revenue
    decreases in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 resulted from
    the successful completion of the FAA Voice Switching and Control
    Systems (“VSCS”) refurbishment phase, completion of
    the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project
    (“MTAIP”) database program for the U.S. Census
    Bureau and a decline in commercial satellite reflectors revenue.

The ramping up of several contract awards in the segment’s
    Healthcare Solutions business also contributed to higher revenue
    in fiscal 2009, including a significant multi-million-dollar,
    ten-year contract with Health First, a Florida-based healthcare
    provider.

The increases in operating income and operating income as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008
    were primarily due to significantly lower charges for schedule
    and cost overruns on commercial satellite reflector programs in
    fiscal 2009 ($18.0 million) than in fiscal 2008
    ($75.9 million). Additionally, operating income and
    operating margin in fiscal 2009 benefitted from the ramping up
    of the FDCA program and strong results on the FTI program. These
    increases to operating income and operating income as a
    percentage of revenue were partially offset by charges for
    cost-reduction actions of $5.0 million.

On April 15, 2009, we acquired Crucial, a privately held
    110-employee Washington, D.C. area provider of
    mission-enabling engineering solutions that address both
    offensive and defensive IT security challenges for Federal law
    enforcement and other U.S. Government agencies. The
    acquisition expanded our capabilities, customer footprint and
    initiatives in the cyber security market.

On June 19, 2009, we acquired 50-employee SolaCom ATC,
    which provides voice and data communications systems and
    solutions for air traffic facilities and radio communications
    between in-flight aircraft and air traffic controllers. The
    acquisition provided our Civil Programs business, a leader in
    air traffic control communications networks and
    telecommunications infrastructure, with an immediate ability to
    address additional segments of the air traffic control
    voice/data systems market and we believe further positioned us
    to support the FAA’s anticipated NextGen program.

Our fiscal 2009 results of operations reflect approximately
    eleven weeks of operating results for Crucial and two weeks of
    operating results for SolaCom ATC, representing the periods
    subsequent to those acquisitions, which were not material to the
    financial results of our Government Communications Systems
    segment.

Orders for this segment were $2.7 billion for fiscal 2009
    compared with $2.5 billion for fiscal 2008. This segment
    derived 96 percent of its revenue from U.S. Government
    customers, including the DoD and intelligence and



civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales through the
    U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime
    contractors, for both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we were awarded two new
    long-term contracts on major government programs. We were
    awarded a ten-year contract, potentially worth
    $736 million, for the GOES-R GS program for NOAA. The
    GOES-R GS system will receive and process satellite data, and
    generate and distribute weather data to more than 10,000 users.
    We were also awarded a ten-year contract, potentially worth
    $600 million, for the MET program.

Fiscal 2010 Compared With Fiscal
    2009:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue decreased 16.7 percent in fiscal 2010 from fiscal
    2009, and this segment had an operating loss of
    $30.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared with an operating
    loss of $238.0 million in fiscal 2009. The decline in
    revenue was primarily due to continued lower
    U.S. broadcaster capital spending as well as the completion
    of the transition from analog to digital transmission in the U.S.

The operating loss in fiscal 2010 included $10 million in
    charges related to cost-reduction actions and $6 million in
    inventory write-downs associated with weaker product demand.
    Results reflected continuing weakness in the U.S. broadcast
    market as well as continued investment to pursue opportunities
    in new media and international markets. Additional
    cost-reduction actions are planned for fiscal 2011 that are
    expected to result in additional charges of approximately
    $7 million. The operating loss in fiscal 2009 was due to a
    $255.5 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill
    and other long-lived assets and included $13.1 million in
    charges related to

cost-reduction

actions.

Orders for this segment were $504 million for fiscal 2010
    compared with $529 million for fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Compared With Fiscal
    2008:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue decreased 9.3 percent in fiscal 2009 from fiscal
    2008, and this segment had an operating loss of
    $238.0 million in fiscal 2009 compared with operating
    income of $33.8 million in fiscal 2008. The operating loss
    in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a $255.5 million
    non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other long-lived
    assets, as described in greater detail below. The global
    recession and postponement of capital projects significantly
    weakened demand. Additionally, this segment recorded charges for
    cost-reduction actions of $13.1 million in fiscal 2009, and
    these actions as well as actions taken in the prior year
    mitigated the impact of lower revenue on operating performance.

Revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 declined in
    both U.S. and international markets and was lower primarily
    as a result of declining sales in Infrastructure and Networking
    Solutions where the impact of the global market softness was
    most significant. Media and Workflow sales were lower compared
    with the prior fiscal year, with weakness in sales of
    U.S. and international traffic systems partially offset by
    higher sales of media server products. Transmission Systems
    sales were modestly lower compared with the prior fiscal year as
    a result of softness in the global radio market.

Although significantly lower advertising revenue in the
    broadcast industry continued to postpone some capital
    investments, we continued to have success in deploying our
    Harris ONE solution for interoperable workflow. This includes
    the capability of tying together IT-centric file-based
    workflows, broadcast technology for plant infrastructure,
    transmission systems and media enterprise software.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our annual
    impairment tests of our reporting units’ goodwill. Because
    of the global recession and postponement of capital projects
    which significantly weakened demand, and the general decline of
    peer company valuations impacting our valuation, we determined
    that goodwill in our Broadcast Communications segment was
    impaired. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009,
    we recorded a



$255.5 million non-cash impairment charge, consisting of
    charges of $160.9 million, $70.2 million and
    $24.4 million for impairment of goodwill, amortizable
    intangible assets and capitalized software, respectively.

Orders for this segment were $529 million for fiscal 2009
    compared with $660 million for fiscal 2008.

Unallocated corporate expense increased
    11.1 percent to $90.4 million in fiscal 2010 from
    $81.4 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to investments
    made in pursuit of new growth opportunities, increased
    charitable contributions and a charge associated with a contract
    termination, which we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal
    2010. As a percentage of revenue, unallocated corporate expense
    was 1.7 percent in fiscal 2010, essentially flat with
    1.6 percent of revenue in fiscal 2009. Corporate
    eliminations decreased to $10.4 million in fiscal 2010 from
    $16.9 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower
    intersegment activity involving the sale of broadcasting
    equipment through our Government Communications Systems segment.

    2008:

Unallocated corporate expense increased
    10.0 percent to $81.4 million in fiscal 2009 from
    $74.0 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to a
    share-based compensation charge of $4.1 million in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the Spin-off of HSTX,
    and a charge of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009 related to cost-reduction actions. As a percentage
    of revenue, unallocated corporate expense was unchanged at
    1.6 percent in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Corporate
    eliminations increased to $16.9 million in fiscal 2009 from
    $7.3 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher
    intersegment activity involving the sale of broadcasting
    equipment through our Government Communications Systems segment.

Discontinued
    Operations

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 Spin-off to our shareholders of all the shares
    of HSTX common stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting
    segment our former HSTX segment. Our historical financial
    results have been restated to account for HSTX as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented in this Report. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

Our
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes the results of
    HSTX through the May 27, 2009 Spin-off date. Accordingly,
    for fiscal 2009, our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and
    the following analysis, includes approximately eleven months of
    cash flows from HSTX.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2009 to
    fiscal 2010 was primarily due to $802.7 million provided by
    operating activities, partially offset by $208.0 million of
    cash used to repurchase shares of our common



stock, $198.0 million of cash paid for additions of
    property, plant and equipment and capitalized software,
    $115.0 million used to pay cash dividends,
    $76.8 million of net repayments of borrowings and
    $52.1 million of cash paid for acquired businesses.

Our financial position remained strong at July 2, 2010. We
    ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of
    $455.2 million; we have no long-term debt maturing until
    fiscal 2016; we have a senior unsecured $750 million
    revolving credit facility that expires in September 2013
    ($720 million of which was available to us as of
    July 2, 2010 as a result of $30 million of short-term
    debt outstanding under our commercial paper program, which is
    supported by our revolving credit facility); and we do not have
    any material defined benefit pension plan obligations.
    Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010, we increased our
    short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper program
    by $320 million to fund a portion of the purchase price for
    the acquisition of CapRock.

Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated
    from operations, credit ratings, available credit facilities,
    cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date,
    and do not expect to experience, any material issues with
    liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our
    future liquidity.

We also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated
    from operations, our credit facilities and access to the public
    and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to
    provide for our anticipated working capital requirements,
    capital expenditures and repurchases under our share repurchase
    program for the next 12 months. We anticipate tax payments
    over the next three years to be approximately equal to our tax
    expense during the same period. We anticipate that our fiscal
    2011 cash outlays may include strategic acquisitions in addition
    to the acquisition of CapRock on July 30, 2010. Other than
    those cash outlays noted in the “Contractual
    Obligations” discussion below in this MD&A, capital
    expenditures, potential acquisitions and repurchases under our
    share repurchase program, no other significant cash outlays are
    anticipated in fiscal 2011.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
    continue to generate cash flow at current levels, that ongoing
    operational improvements will be achieved, or that the cost or
    availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial
    paper program or our credit facilities or in the debt markets
    will not be impacted by the recent or any potential future
    credit and capital markets disruptions. If we are unable to
    maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from
    operations to service our obligations, we may be required to
    sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate
    strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchase
    program, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a
    portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our
    ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or
    refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and
    financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to
    general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and
    broadcast communications markets and to general economic,
    political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory
    factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    operating activities was $802.7 million in fiscal 2010
    compared with $666.8 million in fiscal 2009. All of our
    segments had positive cash flow in fiscal 2010, with significant
    contributions received from our RF Communications and Government
    Communications Systems segments. The increase in net cash
    provided by operating activities was primarily due to strong
    operating results and good working capital management in fiscal
    2010 compared with fiscal 2009.

Net cash used in investing
    activities:

Our net cash used in investing
    activities was $250.1 million in fiscal 2010 compared with
    $864.6 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing
    activities in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to
    $189.9 million of property, plant and equipment additions,
    $8.1 million of capitalized software additions and
    $52.1 million of cash paid for acquired businesses. Net
    cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily
    due to $745.3 million of cash paid for acquired businesses,
    $108.9 million of property, plant and equipment additions
    and $12.9 million of capitalized software additions. The
    increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 compared with
    fiscal 2009 is primarily due to the acquisition and build-out of
    a newly acquired facility for our new Harris Cyber Integration
    Center and our recently acquired RF Communications manufacturing
    facility. Our total capital expenditures, including capitalized
    software, in fiscal 2011 are expected to be between
    $250 million and $275 million.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
    activities:

Our net cash used in financing
    activities was $380.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared with
    net cash provided by financing activities of $117.1 million
    in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal
    2010 was due to $208.0 million used to repurchase shares of
    our common stock, $115.0 million used to pay cash dividends
    and $76.8 million used for net repayment of borrowings,
    partially offset by $18.9 million of proceeds from the
    exercise of employee stock options. Net cash provided by
    financing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to
    $450.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings to partially
    fund acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and
    $5.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee



stock options, partially offset by $132.3 million used to
    repurchase shares of our common stock, $106.6 million used
    to pay cash dividends, and a $100.0 million cash decrease
    related to the HSTX Spin-off.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2010, we used $199.9 million to repurchase
    4,779,411 shares of our common stock under our repurchase
    program at an average price per share of $41.83, including
    commissions. During fiscal 2009, we used $125.0 million to
    repurchase 2,722,438 shares of our common stock under our
    repurchase program at an average price per share of $45.91,
    including commissions. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009,
    $6.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in shares
    of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to
    satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards.
    Additionally, in fiscal 2010, we used $1.4 million to
    repurchase 29,760 shares of our common stock from our Rabbi
    Trust which is associated with our non-qualified deferred
    compensation plans. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and
    retired.

As of July 2, 2010, we have a remaining authorization to
    repurchase approximately $450 million in shares of our
    common stock under our repurchase program, which does not have a
    stated expiration date. Repurchases under our repurchase program
    may be made through open market purchases, private transactions,
    transactions structured through investment banking institutions
    or any combination thereof. Share repurchases are expected to be
    funded with available cash. The level of our repurchases depends
    on a number of factors, including our financial condition,
    capital requirements, results of operations, future business
    prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem
    relevant. The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are
    subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and
    other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or
    discontinued at any time. Additional information regarding share
    repurchases during fiscal 2010 and our repurchase program is set
    forth above under “Item 5. Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Dividends

On August 28, 2010, our Board of Directors increased the
    quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.22 per
    share to $.25 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of
    $1.00 per share, which was our ninth consecutive annual increase
    in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash
    dividend rate was $.88 per share, $.80 per share and $.60 per
    share in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There can be
    no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will
    continue to increase. Quarterly cash dividends are typically
    paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect
    that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future,
    but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future
    dividends. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant. Additional information concerning our
    dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Capital
    Structure and Resources

On September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any time and from time to time during the term of the
    2008 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
    time outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both
    revolving loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be
    guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We also may designate certain
    subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain
    of the covenants and representations in the 2008 Credit
    Agreement do not apply to such subsidiaries.



At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on changes in the ratings of our
    senior, unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”) and on the degree of utilization under the 2008
    Credit Agreement (“Utilization”). The base rate is a
    fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate
    plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly
    announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest
    rate margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then
    the interest rate margin over the base rate will increase to
    either 0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on
    Utilization. Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear
    interest at LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over
    LIBOR described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined
    based on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets; certain
    mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and
    leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing investments;
    and certain investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The 2008
    Credit Agreement also requires that we not permit our ratio of
    consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as
    defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and not permit our
    ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
    expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (measured
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the 2008 Credit Agreement in fiscal 2010. The 2008
    Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including:
    failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms,
    covenants and agreements; material inaccuracy of any
    representation or warranty; payment default under other
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million or acceleration of such indebtedness;
    occurrence of one or more final judgments or orders for the
    payment of money in excess of $75 million that remain
    unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability in excess of
    $75 million; any bankruptcy or insolvency; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 2, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had $30.0 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program, which is supported by the 2008 Credit Agreement.

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a

semi-annual

basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade



rating event, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase
    the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate
    principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued interest
    on the notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. In
    conjunction with the issuance of the notes, we entered into
    treasury lock agreements to protect against fluctuations in
    forecasted interest payments resulting from the issuance of
    ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in the benchmark
    U.S. Treasury rate. These agreements were determined to be
    highly effective in offsetting changes in forecasted interest
    payments as a result of changes in the benchmark
    U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these agreements on
    December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of $5.5 million,
    net of income tax, in shareholders’ equity as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income. This loss, along with
    $5.0 million in debt issuance costs, is being amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the life of the notes, which
    approximates the effective interest rate method, and is
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the
    option of the holders of the debentures. We may redeem the
    remaining $25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures in whole, or in part, at any time at a
    pre-determined redemption price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf registration
    statement, filed with the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to
    the potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

We expect to maintain operating ratios, fixed-charge coverage
    ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient for retention of, or
    improvement to, our current debt ratings. There are no
    assurances that our debt ratings will not be reduced in the
    future.

If our debt ratings are lowered below
    “investment grade,” then we may not be able to issue
    short-term commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow
    under our credit facilities or pursue other options. In
    addition, if our debt ratings are lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may also be required to provide cash
    collateral to support outstanding performance bonds. For a
    discussion of such performance bonds, see “Commercial
    Commitments” below. We do not currently foresee losing our
    investment-grade debt ratings, but no assurances can be given.
    If our debt ratings were downgraded, however, it could adversely
    impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and
    access to capital markets and our ability to receive certain
    types of contract awards.



Contractual
    Obligations

At July 2, 2010, we had contractual cash obligations to
    repay debt, to purchase goods and services, to make payments
    under operating leases and to acquire CapRock. Payments due
    under these long-term obligations are as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
    following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
    not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
    as defined above. As of July 2, 2010, we did not have
    material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
    that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, we
    are not currently a party to any related party transactions that
    materially affect our results of operations, financial condition
    or cash flows.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
    and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
    provide representations, warranties

and/or

indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such
    as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot
    estimate the potential liability from such representations,
    warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown
    conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities
    relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities
    will have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
    acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
    properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
    the event any of these third parties vacates any of these
    premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
    arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
    such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not
    material to our results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Commercial
    Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily



relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain
    contracts to provide products and services to customers or to
    obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. At
    July 2, 2010, we had commercial commitments on outstanding
    surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements,
    as follows:

The standby letters of credit and surety bonds used for
    performance are primarily related to our Public Safety and
    Professional Communications business. As is customary in bidding
    for and completing network infrastructure projects for public
    safety systems, contractors are required to procure
    performance/bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety
    bonds (collectively, “Performance Bonds”). Such
    Performance Bonds normally have maturities of up to three years
    and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a
    mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy
    performance requirements under a contract. A customer is
    permitted to draw on a Performance Bond if we do not fulfill all
    terms of a project contract. In such an event, we would be
    obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the
    Performance Bond for the amounts paid. It has been rare for our
    Public Safety and Professional Communications business and its
    predecessors to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. In addition,
    pursuant to the terms under which we procure Performance Bonds,
    if our credit ratings are lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may be required to provide collateral to
    support a portion of the outstanding amount of Performance
    Bonds. Such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance
    of Performance Bonds and could make it more difficult to procure
    Performance Bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to
    compete for contract awards. Such collateral requirements could
    also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or
    corporate purposes.

Financial
    Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use
    foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both
    balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our
    hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
    estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
    availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent change in
    currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives
    held at July 2, 2010 would not have had a material impact
    on the fair value of such instruments. This quantification of
    exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange
    financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting
    impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated
    assets, liabilities and firm commitments. See

Note 19:
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

in the Notes
    for additional information.

Interest Rates:

As of July 2,
    2010, we had long-term debt obligations and short-term debt
    under our commercial paper program subject to interest rate
    risk. Because the interest rates on our long-term debt
    obligations are fixed, and because our long-term debt is not
    putable (redeemable at the option of the holders of the debt
    prior to maturity), the interest rate risk associated with this
    debt on our results of operations is not material. We have a
    short-term variable-rate commercial paper program in place,
    which we may utilize to satisfy short-term cash



requirements. We can give no assurances that interest rates will
    not change significantly or have a material effect on our income
    or cash flows in fiscal 2011.

Impact of
    Foreign Exchange

Approximately 41 percent of our international business was
    transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2010
    compared with 25 percent in fiscal 2009. The impact of
    translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
    U.S. dollars is included as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. As of July 2, 2010, the
    cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders’
    equity was a $14.3 million gain compared with a
    $17.5 million loss at July 3, 2009. We utilize foreign
    currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of
    international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our
    results in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Impact of
    Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
    practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
    inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
    cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing
    prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin,
    revenue or operating income in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
    of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
    accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
    our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
    transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
    estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies
    and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of
    our financial statements because their application places the
    most significant demands on our judgment, with financial
    reporting results dependent upon estimates about the effect of
    matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in
    subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting
    estimates are described in the following paragraphs. The impact
    and any associated risks related to these estimates on our
    business operations are discussed throughout this MD&A
    where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial
    results. Senior management has discussed the development and
    selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and
    the related disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee
    of our Board of Directors. Preparation of this Report requires
    us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
    estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
    preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
    estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
    based on experience and other information available prior to the
    issuance of the financial statements. Materially different
    results can occur as circumstances change and additional
    information becomes known, including for estimates that we do
    not deem “critical.”

Revenue
    Recognition on Development and Production Contracts and Contract
    Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
    development and production contracts. Revenue related to
    development and production contracts is recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method generally measured by the costs incurred on each contract
    to date against estimated total contract costs at completion

(“cost-to-cost”)

with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated
    profit. The

percentage-of-completion

method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
    Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
    segments. Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or
    other items that may change the scope of a contract are included
    in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and
    realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award fees
    applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
    estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
    is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
    performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
    solely on a single significant event, are generally not
    recognized until the event occurs. Our contracts are generally
    not segmented. If contracts are segmented, we have determined
    that they meet the segmenting criteria outlined in the
    accounting standard for construction-type and production-type
    contracts.

Under the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is
    used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire
    period of performance. Recognition of profit on development and
    production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the
    contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at
    completion and the measurement of progress toward completion.
    The estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal



to the difference between the estimated contract value and the
    estimated total cost at completion. Due to the

long-term

nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total
    cost at completion often requires significant judgment. Factors
    that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed
    include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature
    and complexity of the work to be performed, availability and
    cost of materials, subcontractor performance, the impact of
    delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the
    customer and the recoverability of claims outside the original
    contract included in the estimate to complete. We review cost
    performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts
    at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a
    change in estimated cost to complete a contract is determined to
    have an impact on contract earnings, we will record a positive
    or negative adjustment to estimated earnings when identified.
    Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable contract are
    recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal
    to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. These
    profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of allowable
    costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement. Thus,
    cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to the
    same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We have
    not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to
    estimate our costs related to development and production
    contracts in the past three fiscal years.

As of July 2, 2010, the amount of unbilled costs and
    accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts classified as
    “Inventory” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was
    $295.3 million compared with $305.0 million as of
    June 3, 2009. These amounts include gross costs and accrued
    income, which is netted against billings and progress payments.
    A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs
    could have a material effect on our statement of financial
    position and results of operations. For example, a one percent
    variance in our estimate of accrued income booked as of
    July 2, 2010 on all open fixed-price contracts would impact
    our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
    services by $15.6 million.

Provisions
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
    balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
    competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
    obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
    requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
    and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
    primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand,
    anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
    review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our
    business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and
    use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product
    line, technological change and new product development. These
    factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
    inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
    future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
    we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
    excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
    that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
    recognize such costs in the “Cost of product sales”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of
    such determination. In the case of goods which have been written
    down below cost at the close of a fiscal year, such reduced
    amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting
    purposes. We have not made any material changes in the reserve
    methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during
    the past three fiscal years.

As of July 2, 2010, our reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory was $85.9 million, or 12.3 percent of our
    gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of
    $68.3 million, or 10.1 percent of our gross inventory
    balance, as of July 3, 2009. We recorded
    $20.8 million, $8.6 million and $12.4 million in
    inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess
    and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations
    before income taxes during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure
    the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand,
    including the impact of planned future product launches, any
    significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and our reported operating results.

Goodwill

Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2,
    2010 and July 3, 2009 was $1,576.2 million and
    $1,507.1 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized.
    We perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more
    frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. We test goodwill for
    impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to
    identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of
    each of our reporting units, which we define as our business
    segments, with its net book value, including goodwill, adjusted
    for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as
    appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
    adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
    goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
    goodwill. If the carrying



amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied
    fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in
    an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of
    goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
    goodwill recognized in a business combination. The fair value of
    the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and
    liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible
    assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the
    purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on
    projected cash flows, and sales

and/or

earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months’
    sales and earnings of our reporting units. Projected cash flows
    are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs
    and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial
    and market conditions of the underlying business; and the
    resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate
    discount rate which reflects the risk in the forecasted cash
    flows. The sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and
    earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples
    of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales
    and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar
    businesses made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any
    implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value
    based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair
    value determined by using all of the above-described models, is
    reasonable. We have not made any material changes during the
    past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the
    assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.

Fiscal
    2009 Impairment Tests

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we performed our fiscal
    2009 annual impairment tests of our reporting units’
    goodwill. Because of the global recession and postponement of
    capital projects which significantly weakened demand, and the
    general decline of peer company valuations impacting our
    valuation, we determined that goodwill in our Broadcast
    Communications segment was impaired. As a result, we recorded a
    $160.9 million non-cash charge for the impairment of
    goodwill. See

Note 8: Goodwill

and

Note 22:
    Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for
    additional information regarding goodwill, including impairment
    of our Broadcast Communications segment’s goodwill. We also
    determined that goodwill in our former HSTX segment was
    impaired. See

Note 3: Discontinued Operations

for
    additional information regarding impairment of HSTX’s
    goodwill.

Fiscal
    2010 Impairment Tests

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we performed our fiscal
    2010 annual impairment tests of our reporting units’
    goodwill. We completed these tests with no adjustment required
    to the goodwill of any of our reporting units.

For our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems
    reporting units, the fair value determination resulted in an
    amount that exceeded the reporting unit’s adjusted net book
    value by a substantial margin.

For our Broadcast Communications reporting unit, the fair value
    determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the adjusted
    net book value of this reporting unit by approximately
    8 percent. Goodwill allocated to this reporting unit as of
    July 2, 2010 was $661.2 million. When comparing the
    results from the fair value determination of this reporting unit
    in fiscal 2010 with the results from fiscal 2009, an increase in
    the fair value based on sales multiples paid for recent
    acquisitions of similar businesses and current sales multiples
    of similar businesses was partially offset by a slight decrease
    in fair value based on projected cash flows.

Key assumptions used in projecting cash flows included estimates
    of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics based
    on our intermediate and long-term views of the financial and
    market conditions of the underlying business. These assumptions
    assume a return to more normal industry conditions, including a
    rebound in capital spending by our customers as we anticipate a
    slow, but eventual, global economic recovery; successful
    implementation of several strategic growth initiatives,
    including redeployment of resources into new media and
    international markets, where we believe there are significant
    new business opportunities; and favorable impacts from ongoing
    cost-reduction actions as well as those taken in the current and
    prior fiscal years. Events that could have a detrimental impact
    to the fair value of this reporting unit in the future include a
    prolonged period of global recession, less than forecasted
    demand for our products (for example, a slower or less widely
    than anticipated migration from analog to digital broadcasting
    in international markets), and poor execution of our growth
    strategies. Additionally, a prolonged period of global recession
    could negatively impact fair value based on sales multiples of
    similar business and sales multiples paid for acquisitions of
    similar businesses.

Income
    Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
    operating loss and tax credit



carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred
    tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient
    taxable income of the appropriate character (for example,
    ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or
    carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly
    review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on
    historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the
    expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
    differences and tax planning strategies. We have not made any
    material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax
    valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 2, 2010 included
    a current deferred tax asset of $145.3 million and a
    non-current deferred tax asset of $107.7 million. This
    compares with a current deferred tax asset of
    $117.2 million and a non-current deferred tax asset of
    $85.3 million as of July 3, 2009. The increases in the
    current and

non-current

deferred tax balances were primarily due to acquisitions. For
    all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we
    expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are
    sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income
    needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance
    related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $80.3 million as of
    July 2, 2010 and $72.5 million as of July 3,
    2009. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy
    of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss
    in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient
    future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the
    actual effective tax rates or time period within which the
    underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible,
    or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes,
    we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against
    all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets
    resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate
    and a material adverse impact on our operating results.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but
    have not yet been implemented by us are described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

in the Notes, which describes the potential
    impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from our historical results
    or our current expectations or projections. Other factors
    besides those listed here also could adversely affect us. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report for more
    information regarding factors that might cause our results to
    differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the
    forward-looking statements contained in this Report.

•

We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant
    portion of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a
    shift in U.S. Government funding priorities could have
    adverse consequences on our future business.

•

We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which
    often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase
    in inflation.

•

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business internationally, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates.

•

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the
    improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

•

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export
    licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may
    prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our
    current and future markets.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.



•

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our
    subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely
    deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our
    products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely
    or unsatisfactory manner.

•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

•

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential
    liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or
    indemnity.

•

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

•

The effects of the recent recession in the United States and
    general downturn in the global economy could have an adverse
    impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.

•

We have significant operations in Florida and other locations
    that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of
    a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

•

We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through
    cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant
    disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we
    operate for certain of our customers.

•

We rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our
    managed satellite communications services, and any bandwidth
    constraints could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

•

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation (the “Company”)
    is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
    internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
    appropriate cost-benefit analysis, regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of July 2, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s
    assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the
    Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 2, 2010.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears on page 60 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Harris Corporation as of July 2, 2010 and July 3,
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash
    flows, and comprehensive income and equity, for each of the
    three years in the period ended July 2, 2010. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(2). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Harris Corporation at July 2, 2010
    and July 3, 2009, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended July 2, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Harris Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of July 2, 2010, based on criteria established
    in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 30, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Harris Corporation

We have audited Harris Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of July 2, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Harris
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of July 2, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation as of
    July 2, 2010 and July 3, 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and comprehensive
    income and equity, for each of the three years in the period
    ended July 2, 2010 of Harris Corporation and our report
    dated August 30, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— Our Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
    and its consolidated subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (these “Notes”), the
    terms “Harris,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to Harris Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 spin-off (the “Spin-off”) in the
    form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all
    the shares of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (now known as Aviat
    Networks, Inc.) (“HSTX”) common stock owned by us, we
    eliminated as a reporting segment our former HSTX segment, which
    is reported as discontinued operations in this Report. Until the
    Spin-off, HSTX (formerly our Microwave Communications segment),
    a provider of wireless network solutions, was our majority-owned
    subsidiary, and HSTX’s results of operations and financial
    position were consolidated into our financial statements.
    Subsequent to the Spin-off, we no longer own an equity interest
    in HSTX and, therefore, HSTX no longer constitutes part of our
    business operations. Our historical financial results have been
    restated to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(this “Report”). See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in the Notes relate
    solely to our continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

— Our Consolidated Financial
    Statements have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These
    estimates are based on experience and other information
    available prior to issuance of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Materially different results can occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
    Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal 2010 and 2008 included
    52 weeks. Fiscal 2009 included 53 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
    months when purchased. These investments include accrued
    interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Marketable Equity Securities

— We consider all
    of our

available-for-sale

securities as available for use in our current operations. All
    of our marketable equity securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses,
    net of taxes, included as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
    marketable equity securities

available-for-sale

are determined using the specific identification method. In
    instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions,
    the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price
    of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by
    an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an

“other-than-temporary”

impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the
    value of the investment security recorded on the financial
    statements and our current estimate of fair value is recognized
    as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is
    determined. We include our marketable equity securities in the
    “Other current assets” line item in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    cash and cash equivalents, marketable equity securities

available-for-sale,

accounts receivable, non-current receivables, notes receivable,
    accounts payable and short-term and long-term debt approximate
    their fair values. Fair values for long-term debt are based
    primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar
    instruments. A discussion of fair values for our derivative
    financial instruments is included under the caption
    “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
    net realizable value and they do not bear interest. This value
    includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to
    reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances
    which is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We
    calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs,
    level of past due accounts and economic status of the customers.
    We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the
    term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded
    at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. See

Note 5: Receivables

for additional information
    regarding accounts receivable.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory
    quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and
    obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
    product demand and production requirements. See

Note 6:
    Inventories

for additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are carried on the basis of cost and includes
    software capitalized for internal use. Depreciation of
    buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
    straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
    lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 45 years.
    The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
    range between 2 and 10 years. Amortization of internal-use
    software begins when the software is put into service and is
    based on the expected useful life of the software. The useful
    lives over which we amortize internal-use software generally
    range between 3 and 7 years. See

Note 7: Property,
    Plant and Equipment

for additional information regarding
    property, plant and equipment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are not amortized. We perform annual (or under certain
    circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair value
    (determined by forecasting future cash flows) against their
    carrying value. We test goodwill for impairment using a two-step
    process. The first step is to identify potential impairment by
    comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which
    we define as our business segments, with its net book value,
    including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets
    and liabilities as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting
    unit exceeds its adjusted net book value, goodwill of the
    reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
    the impairment test is unnecessary. If the adjusted net book
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
    the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
    business combination. The fair value of the reporting unit is
    allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit,
    including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
    to acquire the reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill,
    Note 9: Intangible Assets

and

Note 22:
    Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

for
    additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets,
    including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Finite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Long-lived assets, including finite-lived
    intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives. We assess the recoverability of the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with
    finite useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be
    recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based
    upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such
    assets. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash
    flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
    would be recognized for the difference between the fair value
    and the carrying amount. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and
    Equipment, Note 9: Intangible Assets

and

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

for additional information regarding long-lived
    assets and intangible assets, including impairment charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

Capitalized Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed

— Costs incurred to acquire or create a
    computer software product are expensed when incurred as research
    and development until technological feasibility has been
    established for the product, at which point such costs are
    capitalized. Technological feasibility is normally established
    upon completion of a detailed program design. Capitalization of
    computer software costs ceases when the product is available for
    general release to customers. Costs of reproduction,
    documentation, training materials, physical packaging,
    maintenance and customer support are charged to cost of products
    sold as incurred. Capitalized software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed is evaluated for impairment periodically by
    comparing the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer
    software product to the net realizable value of that product. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a
    $24.4 million write-down of capitalized software in our
    Broadcast Communications segment based on market conditions that
    resulted in reduced levels of capital expenditures, including
    demand for Broadcast Communications’ software products. See

Note 22: Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

for additional information regarding impairment
    charges recorded in fiscal 2009.

Capitalized software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed
    had a net carrying value of $27.1 million at July 2,
    2010 and $22.4 million at July 3, 2009. Total
    amortization expense related to these capitalized software



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amounts for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $3.4 million,
    $4.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The
    annual amortization of these capitalized software costs is the
    greater of the amount computed using (a) the ratio that
    current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of
    current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product
    or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining
    estimated economic life of the product. Based on this policy,
    the useful lives over which we amortize costs of computer
    software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed range from 2
    to 7 years. Amortization commences when the product is
    available for general release to customers. The capitalized
    costs, net of accumulated amortization, are reflected in the
    “Other non-current assets” line item in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amortization of capitalized
    software is included in the “Cost of product sales”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No current
    assets within the “Other current assets” line item in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our
    total current assets as of July 2, 2010 or July 3,
    2009. No assets within the “Other non-current assets”
    line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded
    5 percent of total assets as of July 2, 2010 or
    July 3, 2009. No accrued liabilities or expenses within the
    “Other accrued items” or “Other long-term
    liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    exceeded 5 percent of our total current liabilities or
    total liabilities, respectively, as of July 2, 2010 or
    July 3, 2009.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
    tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
    deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
    timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
    tax planning strategies. See

Note 23: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production
    contract sales in our Government Communications Systems and RF
    Communications segments, the value or price of our warranty is
    generally included in the contract and funded by the customer. A
    provision for warranties is built into the estimated program
    costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when applying
    the

cost-to-cost

percentage-of-completion

revenue recognition method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are
    charged to the specific program’s cost, and both revenue
    and cost are recognized at that time. Factors that affect the
    estimated program cost for warranties include terms of the
    contract, complexity of the delivered product or service, number
    of installed units, historical experience and management’s
    judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost
    per claim.

On product sales in our RF Communications, Broadcast
    Communications and Government Communications Systems segments,
    we provide for future warranty costs upon product delivery. The
    specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending
    upon the product sold, customer and country in which we do
    business. In the case of products sold by us, our warranties
    start from the shipment, delivery or customer acceptance date
    and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to twelve years

Broadcast Communications

Less than one year to five years

Government Communications Systems

One to two years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
    customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
    those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
    warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, historical experience and
    management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
    warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
    our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
    adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
    Communications segment generally carry a

90-day

warranty from the date of shipment. Our liability under these
    warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of any portion
    of the software found not to be in substantial compliance with
    the specifications or, if we are unable to do so, to provide a
    full refund.

Software license agreements and sales contracts for products in
    our Broadcast Communications segment generally include
    provisions for indemnifying customers against certain specified
    liabilities should that segment’s products infringe certain
    intellectual property rights of third parties. Certain of our
    Broadcast Communications



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transmission systems customers have notified us of potential
    claims against us based on these standard indemnification
    provisions included in sales contracts between us and these
    customers. These indemnification claims arise from litigation
    brought by a third-party patent licensing company asserting
    alleged technology rights against these customers. We are
    cooperating with these customers in efforts to mitigate their
    litigation exposure. To date, we have not incurred material
    costs as a result of such indemnification and have not accrued
    any liabilities related to such obligations in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements. See

Note 10: Accrued Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
    currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
    currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
    of exchange and income and expense items are translated at the
    weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based
    Compensation

— We measure compensation cost for
    all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at
    fair value and recognize cost over the vesting period. It is our
    policy to issue shares when options are exercised. We have also
    repurchased shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive
    effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans. See

Note 14: Stock Options and Other

Share-Based

Compensation

for additional information regarding
    share-based compensation.

Restructuring Costs

— We record restructuring
    charges for sales or terminations of product lines, closures or
    relocations of business activities, changes in management
    structure, and fundamental reorganizations that affect the
    nature and focus of operations. Such costs include one-time
    termination benefits, contract termination costs and costs to
    consolidate facilities or relocate employees. We record these
    charges at their fair value when incurred. In cases where
    employees are required to render service until they are
    terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and will
    be retained beyond the minimum retention period, we record the
    expense ratably over the future service period. These charges
    are included as a component of the “Engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, due to the global
    economic slowdown, pressure on Department of Defense
    (“DoD”) spending, and contract delays, we announced a
    number of cost-reduction actions across our business segments
    and at our corporate headquarters. We recorded charges, net of
    government cost reimbursement, of $17.8 million for
    severance and other employee-related exit costs and
    $4.5 million related to consolidation of facilities. As of
    the end of fiscal 2009, we had recorded liabilities associated
    with these restructuring activities of $26.5 million, of
    which the majority was paid during fiscal 2010.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
    following revenue recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
    segment:

Revenue in our Government Communications
    Systems segment primarily relates to development and production
    contracts. Revenue and anticipated profits under development and
    production contracts are recorded on a

percentage-of-completion

basis, generally using the

cost-to-cost

method of accounting where sales and profits are recorded based
    on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at
    completion. Recognition of profit on development and production
    fixed-price contracts requires estimates of: the total contract
    value; the total cost at completion; and the measurement of
    progress towards completion. Revenue and profits on
    cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized as allowable costs
    are incurred on the contract, and become billable to the
    customer, in an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the
    profit on those costs.

Contracts are combined when specific aggregation criteria are
    met. Criteria generally include closely interrelated activities
    performed for a single customer within the same economic
    environment. Contracts are generally not segmented. If contracts
    are segmented, we have determined that they meet specific
    segmenting criteria. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims or other items are included in sales only when
    they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable.
    Incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on
    contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates
    and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess
    anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions, which
    increase earnings based solely on a single significant event,
    are generally not recognized until the event occurs. When
    adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined,
    any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in
    the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts or programs
    in progress are charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product sales other than
    development and production contracts and revenue from service
    arrangements, which are recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists, the fee is



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fixed or determinable, collection is probable, delivery of a
    product has occurred, and title has transferred or services have
    been rendered. Further, if an arrangement other than a
    development and production contract requires the delivery or
    performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled
    sale, we determine whether the individual elements represent
    separate units of accounting. If they do, we recognize the
    revenue associated with each element separately and contract
    revenue is allocated among elements based on relative fair
    value. If the elements within a bundled sale are not considered
    separate units of accounting, the delivery of an individual
    element is considered not to have occurred if there are
    undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality.
    Unearned income on service contracts is amortized by the
    straight-line method over the term of the contracts. Also, if
    contractual obligations related to customer acceptance exist,
    revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless these
    obligations are satisfied.

RF Communications segment:

Revenue in our RF
    Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
    sales. Revenue recognition from development and production
    contracts and product and services sales follows the same
    policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
    segment’s revenue recognition policy above.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in
    our Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to
    product and services sales and software licenses. Revenue
    recognition from development and production contracts and
    product and services sales follows the same policies as stated
    under our Government Communications Systems segment’s
    revenue recognition policy above. This segment derives a portion
    of its revenue from the licensing of software with multi-year
    maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue allocated to
    undelivered elements under these bundled software licenses is
    based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual
    method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as
    indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as
    unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements
    is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned
    revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a
    straight-line basis over the maintenance agreement. In the case
    of software products for which we sell term-based licenses
    including multi-year maintenance agreements, but do not have
    vendor-specific objective evidence on the undelivered element,
    the entire arrangement is recognized ratably on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the license.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a
    component of the “Non-operating income (loss)” line
    item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized
    on the basis of terms specified in contractual agreements.
    Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in
    the “Revenue from product sales” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income and the associated costs are
    included in the “Cost of product sales” line item in
    our Consolidated Statement of Income. Also, we record taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from
    revenues.

Retirement Benefits

— As of July 2, 2010,
    we provide retirement benefits to substantially all

U.S.-based

employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
    plan that includes a 401(k) plan and certain

non-qualified

deferred compensation plans. The defined contribution retirement
    plan has matching and savings elements. Contributions by us to
    the retirement plan are based on employees’ savings with no
    other funding requirements. We may make additional contributions
    to the retirement plan at our discretion. Retirement benefits
    also include a defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom and an
    unfunded limited healthcare plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and employees on long-term disability. We accrue the
    estimated cost of these medical benefits, which are not
    material, during an employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expenses amounted to $53.2 million in
    fiscal 2010, $46.9 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $46.0 million in fiscal 2008. Retirement plan expenses
    exclude profit sharing under our performance reward plan, which
    is recorded as compensation expense.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
    environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
    of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
    contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
    existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
    costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 14 sites
    where future liabilities could exist. These sites include 2
    sites owned by us, 8 sites associated with our former graphics
    or semiconductor locations and 4 treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
    attributable to us from past operations. Based on an assessment
    of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
    liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”) and other environmental statutes and
    regulations for identified sites, using a 7.5 percent
    discount rate, is approximately



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$4.5 million. The current portion of this liability is
    included in the “Other accrued items” line item and
    the

non-current

portion is included in the “Other long-term
    liabilities” line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred
    over the next 15 to 20 years (depending on the number of
    years for each site) is approximately $7.2 million. The
    expected payments for the next five years are: fiscal
    2011 — $0.6 million; fiscal 2012 —
    $0.5 million; fiscal 2013 — $0.7 million;
    fiscal 2014 — $0.6 million; fiscal
    2015 — $0.7 million; and the aggregate amount
    thereafter is approximately $4.1 million. The relevant
    factors we considered in estimating our potential liabilities
    under the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
    regulations include cost-sharing agreements with other parties
    and the potential indemnification from successor and predecessor
    owners of these sites. We do not believe that any uncertainties
    regarding these relevant factors will materially affect our
    potential liability under the Superfund Act and other
    environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
    Commitments

— Financial guarantees are contingent
    commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
    a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
    paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. As of
    July 2, 2010, there were no such contingent commitments
    accrued for in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. As of July 2, 2010, we had total
    commercial commitments, including debt and performance
    guarantees, of $468.4 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

— In
    the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. We recognize all derivatives in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that
    are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If
    the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
    changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset
    against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm
    commitments through earnings or recognized in other
    comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
    earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
    in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We do not
    hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. See

Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

for additional information regarding our use of derivative
    instruments.

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is
    based upon the weighted average number of common and common
    equivalent shares outstanding during each year. See

Note 15: Income From Continuing Operations
    Per Share

for additional information regarding net
    income per share.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    to conform with current-year classifications.

NOTE 2:

ACCOUNTING
    CHANGES OR RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards

In fiscal 2010, we adopted the following accounting standards,
    none of which had a material impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows:

•

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards
    Codification

(“Codification”), which is now the source of
    authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied for
    financial statements issued for periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. Additionally, we are using the new
    guidelines prescribed by the Codification when referring to
    GAAP, including the elimination of pre-Codification GAAP
    references unless accompanied by Codification GAAP references.

•

The provisions of the accounting standard for fair value
    measurements related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis; and the
    accounting standard requiring interim disclosures about fair
    value of financial instruments, which extends the annual
    disclosure requirements about fair value of financial
    instruments to interim reporting periods. See

Note 24:
    Fair Value Measurements

for fair value disclosures required
    by these standards.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

The accounting standard updating accounting, presentation and
    disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which requires that
    noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority
    interests) be clearly identified and presented as a component of
    equity, separate from the parent’s equity. This standard
    also requires that the amount of consolidated net income
    attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be
    clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
    statement of income; that changes in ownership interest be
    accounted for as equity transactions; and that when a subsidiary
    is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment
    in that subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation
    of that subsidiary be measured at fair value. As a result of
    implementing this standard, for the applicable periods in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income, the “Net income”
    line item includes 100 percent of the results of HSTX, and
    the “Net income attributable to Harris Corporation”
    line item includes 56 percent of the results of HSTX (which
    was the percentage of outstanding shares of HSTX owned by us
    prior to the Spin-off).

•

The accounting standard for determining whether instruments
    granted in share-based payment transactions are participating
    securities. Also, income per basic and diluted common share
    should be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury
    stock or two-class methods. Prior to the issuance of this
    accounting standard, we had been using the treasury method. In
    accordance with this standard, basic and diluted weighted
    average common shares outstanding for prior periods have been
    restated. The application of this standard decreased income from
    continuing operations per basic common share by $.04, $.01 and
    $.03, in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively;
    and decreased income from continuing operations per diluted
    common share by $.03, $.02 and $.02 in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009
    and fiscal 2008, respectively. See

Note 15: Income From
    Continuing Operations Per Share

for further information.

•

The accounting standards for accounting for business
    combinations, which significantly change the accounting and
    reporting requirements related to business combinations,
    including the recognition of acquisition-related transaction and
    post-acquisition restructuring costs in our results of
    operations as incurred. While the adoption of these standards
    did not have a material impact on our results of operations or
    cash flows directly in, or on our financial position directly as
    of the end of, fiscal 2010, it may have a significant effect on
    the accounting for any future acquisitions we make.

•

The accounting standard that requires additional disclosures
    about fair value of financial instruments and also clarifies
    certain existing disclosure requirements, including the
    requirement to provide fair value measurement disclosures for
    each class of assets and liabilities instead of each major
    category of assets and liabilities. See

Note 24: Fair
    Value Measurements

for fair value disclosures required by
    this standard.

•

The accounting standard that eliminated the requirement for SEC
    filers to disclose the date through which subsequent events were
    evaluated.

Accounting
    Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective

In October 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standards update
    that revises accounting and reporting requirements for
    arrangements with multiple deliverables. This update allows the
    use of an estimated selling price to determine the selling price
    of a deliverable in cases where neither vendor-specific
    objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available, which
    is expected to increase the ability for entities to separate
    deliverables in

multiple-deliverable

arrangements and, accordingly, to decrease the amount of revenue
    deferred in these cases. Additionally, this update requires the
    total selling price of a multiple-deliverable arrangement to be
    allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all
    deliverables based on relative selling prices. This update is to
    be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
    or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010, which for us is our fiscal 2011. We do not
    currently anticipate that the adoption of this update will
    materially impact our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standards update
    that clarifies which revenue allocation and measurement guidance
    should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible
    products and software, in cases where the software is more than
    incidental to the tangible product as a whole. More
    specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the
    tangible product is essential to the functionality of the
    tangible product, then this software as well as undelivered
    software elements that relate to this software are excluded from
    the scope of existing software revenue guidance, which is
    expected to decrease the amount of revenue deferred in these
    cases. This update is to be applied prospectively for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
    beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for us is our
    fiscal 2011. We do not currently anticipate that the adoption of
    this update will materially impact our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3:

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

On March 31, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved the Spin-off of all the shares of HSTX owned by us to
    our shareholders. On May 27, 2009, we completed the
    Spin-off through the distribution of our ownership of
    approximately 56 percent of the outstanding shares of HSTX
    in the form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders.
    Each of our shareholders received approximately 0.248418 of a
    share of HSTX Class A common stock for each share of our
    common stock such shareholder held as of 5:30 p.m. Eastern
    Time on May 13, 2009, the record date for the Spin-off. The
    distribution ratio was based on the number of shares of HSTX
    Class B common stock owned by us, which we exchanged for an
    equal number of shares of HSTX Class A common stock prior
    to the distribution in order to effect the Spin-off, divided by
    the number of shares of our common stock and common stock
    equivalents outstanding on the record date. Our shareholders of
    record on the record date received cash in lieu of any fraction
    of a HSTX share that they would have otherwise received in the
    Spin-off. In aggregate, we distributed 32,913,377 shares of
    HSTX Class A common stock to our shareholders. Based upon
    the $5.26 per share closing price for the HSTX Class A
    common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on May 26, 2009,
    the day prior to the date of the distribution, the aggregate
    market value of the shares distributed was $173.1 million.
    Our historical financial results have been restated to account
    for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods presented in
    this Report.

Prior to the Spin-off of HSTX, as of the end of the second
    quarter of fiscal 2009, based on the current global economic
    environment and the decline of the market capitalization of
    HSTX, we performed an interim review for impairment of
    HSTX’s goodwill and its other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, consisting solely of the Stratex trade name. To test for
    potential impairment of HSTX’s goodwill, we determined the
    fair value of HSTX based on projected discounted cash flows and
    market-based multiples applied to sales and earnings. The
    results indicated an impairment of goodwill because the current
    carrying value of the segment exceeded its fair value. We then
    allocated this fair value to HSTX’s underlying assets and
    liabilities to determine the implied fair value of goodwill,
    resulting in a $279.0 million charge to write down all of
    HSTX’s goodwill. We determined the fair value of the
    Stratex trade name by performing a projected discounted cash
    flow analysis based on the relief-from-royalty approach,
    resulting in a $22.0 million charge to write down a
    majority of the carrying value of the Stratex trade name.
    Substantially all of the goodwill and the Stratex trade name
    were recorded in connection with the combination of Stratex and
    our Microwave Communications Division in January 2007.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2009 we made the following significant acquisition:

•

Acquisition of Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems
    Business.

On May 29, 2009, we acquired
    substantially all of the assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless
    systems business (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known
    as

M/A-COM),

an established provider of mission-critical wireless
    communications systems for law enforcement, fire and rescue,
    public service, utility and transportation markets. In
    connection with the acquisition, we assumed liabilities
    primarily related to Wireless Systems. We did not assume the
    State of New York wireless network contract awarded to Wireless
    Systems in December 2004. The total purchase price for Wireless
    Systems was $674.9 million. We report Wireless Systems,
    which we now call the Public Safety and Professional
    Communications business, within our RF Communications segment.
    We believe the acquisition created a powerful supplier of

end-to-end

wireless network solutions to the global land mobile radio
    systems market. Additional details, including calculation of the
    purchase price, identifiable intangible assets and Wireless
    Systems’ Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition
    date, are provided in the table and notes below.

The long-term contract liability recorded in the purchase price
    allocation is for a significant loss contract acquired with a
    single customer to build, deploy, own, operate and maintain a
    statewide network for 20 years, of which 12 years were
    remaining under the contract on the acquisition date.

In connection with our acquisition of Wireless Systems, we
    allocated $7.0 million of the purchase price to two
    in-process research and development projects. These allocations
    represent the estimated fair value based on

risk-adjusted

cash flows related to these incomplete projects. These costs
    were expensed as a charge to earnings and are included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In making
    these purchase price allocations we relied on present value
    calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments
    and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution
    and project risk. The value assigned to the purchased in-process
    research and development was determined by estimating the costs
    to develop the purchased in-process research and development
    into commercially viable products and discounting the net cash
    flows to their present value using a discount rate of
    15 percent. The two in-process research and development
    projects consisted of a new product platform and a new
    technology. As of the valuation date, the new product platform
    project was approximately 75 percent complete with a
    product launch expected at the end of calendar 2009 and had
    remaining costs until completion of approximately
    $2.1 million. As of the valuation date, the new technology
    project was approximately 80 percent complete with a
    product launch expected in early fiscal 2010 and had remaining
    costs until completion of approximately $1.1 million.

Pro
    Forma Results (Unaudited)

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
    our unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the
    acquisition of Wireless Systems had been completed as of the
    beginning of fiscal 2008, after including the impact of
    adjustments such as amortization of intangible assets, interest
    expense on related borrowings, and the related income tax
    effects. This pro forma presentation does not include any impact
    of transaction synergies.

    entire periods presented. The decrease in Wireless Systems’
    contribution to our pro forma income from continuing operations
    in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 is primarily a result
    of higher radio sales in fiscal 2008 by Wireless Systems to
    Sprint Nextel related to the federally mandated 800 MHz
    band spectrum reconfiguration in order to reduce the frequency
    interference between public safety and commercial markets.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The goodwill resulting from this business combination was
    associated primarily with Wireless Systems’ market presence
    and leading position, growth opportunities in the market in
    which they operate, and experienced work force and established
    operating infrastructure. The goodwill resulting from this
    acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.

NOTE 11:

CREDIT
    ARRANGEMENTS

On September 10, 2008, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “2008 Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans, including swingline loans, and letters of
    credit at any time and from time to time during the term of the
    2008 Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount at any
    time outstanding not to exceed $750 million for both
    revolving loans and letters of credit, with a

sub-limit

of
    $50 million for swingline loans and $125 million for
    letters of credit. The 2008 Credit Agreement includes a
    provision pursuant to which, from time to time, we may request
    that the lenders in their discretion increase the maximum amount
    of commitments under the 2008 Credit Agreement by an amount not
    to exceed $500 million. Only consenting lenders (including
    new lenders reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent)
    will participate in any such increase. In no event will the
    maximum amount of credit extensions available under the 2008
    Credit Agreement exceed $1.25 billion. The 2008 Credit
    Agreement may be used for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes (excluding hostile acquisitions) and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. Borrowings under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement may be denominated in
    U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling and any other currency
    acceptable to the administrative agent and the lenders, with a

non-U.S. currency

sub-limit

of
    $150 million. We may designate certain wholly owned
    subsidiaries as borrowers under the 2008 Credit Agreement, and
    the obligations of any such subsidiary borrower must be
    guaranteed by Harris Corporation. We also may designate certain
    subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which means certain
    of the covenants and representations in the 2008 Credit
    Agreement do not apply to such subsidiaries.

At our election, borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in U.S. Dollars will bear interest either at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an
    applicable margin. The interest rate margin over LIBOR,
    initially set at 0.50 percent, may increase (to a maximum
    amount of 1.725 percent) or decrease (to a minimum of
    0.385 percent) based on changes in the ratings of our
    senior, unsecured long-term debt securities (“Senior Debt
    Ratings”) and on the degree of utilization under the 2008
    Credit Agreement (“Utilization”). The base rate is a
    fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate
    plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s publicly



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

announced prime lending rate for U.S. Dollars. The interest
    rate margin over the base rate is 0.00 percent, but if our
    Senior Debt Ratings fall to “BB+/Ba1” or below, then
    the interest rate margin over the base rate will increase to
    either 0.225 percent or 0.725 percent based on
    Utilization. Borrowings under the 2008 Credit Agreement
    denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will bear
    interest at LIBOR plus the applicable interest rate margin over
    LIBOR described above. Letter of credit fees are also determined
    based on our Senior Debt Ratings and Utilization.

The 2008 Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: certain liens on our assets; certain
    mergers, consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and
    leaseback transactions; certain vendor financing investments;
    and certain investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The 2008
    Credit Agreement also requires that we not permit our ratio of
    consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as
    defined, to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and not permit our
    ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
    expense, each as defined, to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (measured
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the rolling
    four-quarter period then ending). We were in compliance with the
    covenants in the 2008 Credit Agreement in fiscal 2010. The 2008
    Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including:
    failure to make payments; failure to perform or observe terms,
    covenants and agreements; material inaccuracy of any
    representation or warranty; payment default under other
    indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of
    $75 million or acceleration of such indebtedness;
    occurrence of one or more final judgments or orders for the
    payment of money in excess of $75 million that remain
    unsatisfied; incurrence of certain ERISA liability in excess of
    $75 million; any bankruptcy or insolvency; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with
    accrued interest and fees. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement are due and mature on
    September 10, 2013, unless the commitments are terminated
    earlier either at our request or if certain events of default
    occur. At July 2, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement, but we had $30.0 million
    of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper
    program, which is supported by the 2008 Credit Agreement.

We have an automatically effective, universal shelf registration
    statement, filed with the SEC on June 3, 2009, related to
    the potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depositary shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

NOTE 12:

SHORT-TERM

Our short-term debt was $30.0 million at July 2, 2010
    and $105.7 million at July 3, 2009, and this
    short-term debt consisted solely of commercial paper. The
    weighted-average interest rate for our short-term debt was
    0.4 percent at July 2, 2010 and 1.0 percent at
    July 3, 2009.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On June 9, 2009, we completed the issuance of
    $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the notes
    is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a

semi-annual

basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 37.5 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. We incurred $4.1 million in debt
    issuance costs and discounts related to the issuance of the
    notes, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the life of the notes, which approximates the effective interest
    rate method, and are reflected as a portion of interest expense
    in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

On December 5, 2007, we completed the issuance of
    $400 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.95% Notes due December 1, 2017. Interest on the
    notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may
    redeem the notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in
    part at the “make-whole” redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price is equal to the greater
    of 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
    redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
    scheduled payments of the principal and interest (other than
    interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the notes being
    redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
    basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 30 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a
    below-investment-grade rating event, we may be required to make
    an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to
    101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
    repurchased, plus accrued interest on the notes repurchased to
    the date of repurchase. In conjunction with the issuance of the
    notes, we entered into treasury lock agreements to protect
    against fluctuations in forecasted interest payments resulting
    from the issuance of ten-year, fixed-rate debt due to changes in
    the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. These agreements were
    determined to be highly effective in offsetting changes in
    forecasted interest payments as a result of changes in the
    benchmark U.S. Treasury rate. Upon termination of these
    agreements on December 6, 2007, we recorded a loss of
    $5.5 million, net of income tax, in shareholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    This loss, along with $5.0 million in debt issuance costs,
    is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
    notes, which approximates the effective interest rate method,
    and is reflected as a portion of interest expense in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in our Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. On December 5, 2007, we repurchased
    and retired $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed
    $99.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    debentures pursuant to the procedures for redemption at the
    option of the holders of the debentures. We may redeem the
    remaining $25.8 million in aggregate principal amount of
    the debentures in whole, or in part, at any time at a
    pre-determined redemption price.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. The debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

STOCK
    OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of July 2, 2010, we had three shareholder-approved
    employee stock incentive plans (“SIPs”) under which
    options or other share-based compensation was outstanding, and
    we had the following types of share-based awards outstanding
    under our SIPs: stock options, performance share awards,
    performance share unit awards, restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock unit awards. We believe that such awards more
    closely align the interests of employees with those of
    shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated
    vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our
    SIPs).

Shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance
    under our SIPs totaled 17,800,543 as of July 2, 2010. In
    fiscal 2010, we issued an aggregate of 898,766 shares of
    common stock under the terms of our SIPs, which is net of shares
    withheld for tax purposes.

Stock
    Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under shareholder-approved SIPs. Option exercise
    prices are equal to or greater than the fair market value of our
    common stock on the date the options are granted, using the
    closing stock price of our common stock. Options may be
    exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally
    ranges from seven to ten years after the date of grant, and they
    generally become exercisable in installments, which are
    typically 33.3 percent one year from the grant date,
    33.3 percent two years from the grant date and
    33.3 percent three years from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton

option-pricing

model which uses assumptions noted in the following table.
    Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded
    options on our common stock and the historical volatility of our
    stock price over the expected term of the options. The expected
    term of the options is based on historical observations of our
    common stock over the past ten years, considering average years
    to exercise for all options exercised, average years to
    cancellation for all options cancelled and average years
    remaining for outstanding options, which is calculated based on
    the weighted-average vesting period plus the weighted-average of
    the difference between the vesting period and average years to
    exercise and cancellation. The risk-free rate for periods within
    the contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

    fair value of stock option grants under our SIPs is as follows:

    The total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $16.8 million,
    $12.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
    under our SIPs. The restricted stock and restricted stock units
    are not transferable until vested and the restrictions lapse
    upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified
    time period.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
    closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and is
    amortized to compensation expense over its vesting period. At
    July 2, 2010, there were 530,616 shares of restricted
    stock outstanding.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 2, 2010, we had 59,632 restricted stock units
    outstanding.

    1.72 years. The weighted-average grant date price per share
    of restricted stock and per unit of restricted stock units
    granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $36.45, $50.57 and

    and restricted stock units that vested during fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008 was approximately $8.3 million, $5.1 million
    and $3.5 million, respectively.

Performance
    Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares and performance share units that have been granted to
    employees under our SIPs. Generally, performance share and
    performance share unit awards are subject to performance
    criteria such as meeting predetermined earnings and return on
    invested capital targets for a

three-year

plan period. These awards also generally vest at the expiration
    of the same three-year period. The final determination of the
    number of shares to be issued in respect of an award is
    determined by our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board
    of Directors.

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of our common stock on the date of grant and is amortized
    to compensation expense over its vesting period, if achievement
    of the performance measures is considered probable. At
    July 2, 2010, there were 904,823 performance shares
    outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    July 2, 2010, there were 75,131 performance share units
    outstanding.

INCOME
    FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER SHARE

In the quarter ended October 2, 2009, we retrospectively
    adopted an accounting standard requiring that our unvested
    share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive
    nonforfeitable dividends be treated as participating securities
    and that such awards be included in the calculations of income
    per basic and diluted common share using the more dilutive of
    the treasury stock or two-class methods. Our performance share
    awards and restricted stock awards meet the definition of
    participating securities and are included in the calculations of
    income from continuing operations per basic and diluted common
    share presented below using the two-class method, including
    restatement of prior period amounts. Prior to the issuance of
    this accounting standard, we had been using the treasury method.

The computations of income from continuing operations per share
    are as follows:

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due August
    2022. Holders of the debentures had the right to convert each of
    their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the
    stated maturity. During fiscal 2008, each holder received
    44.2404 shares of our common stock for each $1,000 of
    debentures surrendered for conversion. This represented a
    conversion price of $22.625 per share of our common stock. All
    outstanding debentures were either converted or redeemed during
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Potential dilutive common shares primarily consist of employee
    stock options. Employee stock options to purchase approximately
    3,300,641, 3,270,318 and 862,840 shares of our common stock
    were outstanding at the end of fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, but were not included in the computation of income
    from continuing operations per diluted common share because the
    effect would have been antidilutive as the options’
    exercise prices exceeded the weighted average market price.

NOTE 16:

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs were $325.8 million in
    fiscal 2010, $243.5 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $248.0 million in fiscal 2008 and are included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
    Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred
    pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for
    principally by the

percentage-of-completion

method. Customer-sponsored research and development costs
    incurred under U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require
    us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined
    performance or other specifications (such as designs).
    Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $720.9 million in fiscal 2010, $759.2 million in
    fiscal 2009 and $731.8 million in fiscal 2008.
    Customer-sponsored research and development is included in our
    revenue and cost of product sales and services.

INTEREST
    EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $72.1 million,
    $52.8 million and $53.1 million in fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Interest paid was $69.8 million,
    $49.0 million and $54.1 million in fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

NOTE 18:

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

Total rental expense amounted to $46.3 million in fiscal
    2010, $31.5 million in fiscal 2009 and $33.4 million
    in fiscal 2008. Future minimum rental commitments under leases
    with an initial lease term in excess of one year, primarily for
    land and buildings, amounted to approximately
    $181.9 million at July 2, 2010. These commitments for
    the years following fiscal 2010 and, in total, thereafter are:
    fiscal 2011 — $41.6 million; fiscal
    2012 — $33.1 million; fiscal 2013 —
    $24.7 million; fiscal 2014 — $19.7 million;
    fiscal 2015 — $14.9 million; and
    $47.9 million thereafter. These commitments do not contain
    any material rent escalations, rent holidays, contingent rent,
    rent concessions, leasehold improvement incentives or unusual
    provisions or conditions. We do not consider any of these
    individual leases material to our operations. Leasehold
    improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during
    the lease term are amortized over the current lease term, or
    estimated life, if shorter.

NOTE 19:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to global
    market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks and formally document all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedge transactions. We recognize all derivatives in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We do not hold or
    issue derivatives for trading purposes.

At July 2, 2010, we had open foreign currency forward
    contracts with a notional amount of $46.5 million, of which
    $16.2 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
    $30.3 million were classified as fair value hedges. This
    compares with open foreign currency forward contracts with a
    notional amount of $47.6 million at July 3, 2009, of
    which $20.2 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
    $27.4 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
    July 2, 2010, contract expiration dates ranged from less
    than 1 month to 12 months with a weighted average
    contract life of 2 months.

Balance
    Sheet Hedges

To manage the exposure in our balance sheet to risks from
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we implement fair
    value hedges. More specifically, we use foreign currency forward
    contracts and options to hedge certain balance sheet items,
    including foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and
    inventory. Changes in the value of the derivatives and the
    related hedged items are reflected in earnings, in the
    “Cost of product sales and services” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income. As of July 2, 2010, we
    had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts denominated
    in the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian
    Dollar to hedge certain balance sheet items. The net gains on
    foreign currency forward contracts designated as fair value
    hedges were not material in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. In
    addition, no amounts were recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010,
    2009 and 2008 related to hedged firm commitments that no longer
    qualify as fair value hedges.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

To manage our exposure to currency risk and market fluctuation
    risk associated with anticipated cash flows that are probable of
    occurring in the future, we implement cash flow hedges. More
    specifically, we use foreign currency forward contracts and
    options to hedge off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments, including purchase commitments from suppliers,
    future committed sales to customers and intercompany
    transactions. These derivatives are primarily being used to
    hedge currency exposures from cash flows anticipated in our RF
    Communications segment related to programs in the United
    Kingdom, Canada, Kosovo and China. We also have hedged
    U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
    anticipated profit margins in our international operations. As
    of July 2, 2010, we had outstanding foreign currency
    forward contracts denominated in the Euro, British Pound,
    Canadian Dollar and Chinese Yuan Renminbi to hedge certain
    forecasted transactions.

These derivatives have only nominal intrinsic value at the time
    of purchase and have a high degree of correlation to the
    anticipated cash flows they are designated to hedge. Hedge
    effectiveness is determined by the correlation of the
    anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates of the derivatives
    used to hedge these cash flows. These financial instruments are

marked-to-market

using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to
    other



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. Gains and
    losses from other comprehensive income are reclassified to
    earnings when the related hedged item is recognized in earnings.
    The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair
    value is immediately recognized in earnings. The cash flow
    impact of our derivatives is included in the same category in
    our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of
    the item being hedged.

The amount of gains or losses from cash flow hedges recognized
    in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income, including
    gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness, was not
    material in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. We do not expect the
    amount of gains or losses recognized in the “Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss” line item in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of July 2, 2010 that will be reclassified
    to earnings from comprehensive income within the next
    12 months to be material.

Credit
    Risk

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
    by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
    based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to any single
    counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
    position with each counterparty.

    foreign currency forward contracts in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as of July 2, 2010, and see our Consolidated

IMPAIRMENT
    OF GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
    assets for impairment annually, as well as when we change
    reporting segments and when events or circumstances indicate
    there may be an impairment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2009, we performed our annual review for impairment of our
    reporting units’ goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets. To test for potential impairment, we
    determined the fair value of our reporting units based on
    projected discounted cash flows and market-based multiples
    applied to sales and earnings. Because of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the global recession and postponement of capital projects which
    significantly weakened demand, and the general decline of peer
    company valuations impacting our valuation, it appeared that
    goodwill in our Broadcast Communications segment was impaired,
    as the results of step one testing indicated the adjusted net
    book value of this segment exceeded its fair value. We then
    allocated this fair value to the Broadcast Communications
    segment’s underlying assets and liabilities to determine
    the implied fair value of goodwill.

In conjunction with the above-described impairment review, we
    conducted a review for impairment of Broadcast
    Communications’ other long-lived assets, including
    amortizable intangible assets and capitalized software, as any
    impairment of these assets must be considered prior to the
    conclusion of the impairment review. The fair value of Broadcast
    Communications’ other long-lived assets were determined
    based on projected discounted cash flows based on future sales
    and operating costs, except for product trade names, in which
    case we projected discounted cash flows based on the
    relief-from-royalty method.

As a result of these impairment reviews, we determined that the
    goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and capitalized software
    for the Broadcast Communications segment were impaired.
    Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the
    Broadcast Communications segment recorded a $255.5 million
    impairment charge, consisting of charges of $160.9 million,
    $70.2 million and $24.4 million for impairment of
    goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and capitalized
    software, respectively.

United States income taxes have not been provided on

    subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest those earnings
    indefinitely. Determination of unrecognized deferred
    U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries is not practicable. Tax loss and
    credit carryforwards as of July 2, 2010 have expiration
    dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
    instances. The amount of Federal, international, and state and
    local tax loss carryforwards as of July 2, 2010 were
    $29.9 million, $56.6 million and $10.0 million,
    respectively. Income (loss) from continuing operations before
    income taxes of international subsidiaries was
    $(4.9) million in fiscal 2010, $(59.3) million in
    fiscal 2009 and $30.0 million in fiscal 2008. Income taxes
    paid were $280.5 million in fiscal 2010,
    $308.4 million in fiscal 2009 and $208.8 million in
    fiscal 2008. The valuation allowance increased $7.8 million
    from $72.5 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to
    $80.3 million at the end of fiscal 2010. The valuation
    allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes,
    to offset certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due
    to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the

    benefits are eventually recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. We
    had accrued $3.4 million for the potential payment of
    interest and penalties as of July 3, 2009 (and this amount
    was not included in the $23.1 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits balance at July 3, 2009 shown above) and
    $2.3 million of this total could favorably impact future
    tax rates. We had accrued $3.5 million for the potential
    payment of interest and penalties as of July 2, 2010 (and
    this amount was not included in the $33.2 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits balance at July 2, 2010 shown
    above) and $2.4 million of this total could favorably
    impact future tax rates.

We file numerous separate and consolidated income tax returns
    reporting our financial results and, where appropriate, those of
    our subsidiaries and affiliates, in the U.S. Federal
    jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign
    jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Compliance Assurance Process, the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is examining fiscal
    2009, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. We are currently under
    examination by the Canadian Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2005
    through 2007, and we are appealing portions of a Canadian
    assessment relating to

fiscal years 2000 through 2004. We are currently under
    examination by various state and international tax authorities
    for fiscal years ranging from 1997 through 2009. It is
    reasonably possible that there could be a significant decrease
    or increase to our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the
    course of the next twelve months as these examinations continue,
    other tax examinations commence or various statutes of
    limitations expire. An estimate of the range of possible changes
    cannot be made because of the significant number of
    jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax
    periods.

NOTE 24:

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair
    value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market
    (or most advantageous market, in the absence of a principal
    market) for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. Further,
    entities are required to maximize the use of observable inputs
    and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair
    value, and to utilize a three-level fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three
    levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted
    prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for
    similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
    for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
    are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are
    observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by,
    observable market data by correlation or other means.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities, and reflect our own
    assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best
    information available in the circumstances.

The following table represents the fair value hierarchy of our
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring

    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our continuing operations in the following
    three business segments — RF Communications,
    Government Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications.
    Our RF Communications segment is a global supplier of secure
    tactical radio communications and embedded high-grade encryption
    solutions for military and government organizations and also of
    secure communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. Our Government
    Communications Systems segment conducts advanced research
    studies and produces, integrates and supports highly reliable,
    net-centric communications and information technology that solve
    the mission-critical challenges of our defense, intelligence and
    civilian U.S. Government customers. Our Broadcast
    Communications segment serves the global digital and analog
    media markets, providing workflow, infrastructure and networking
    products and solutions; media solutions; and television and
    radio transmission equipment and systems. Within each of our
    business segments, there are multiple program areas and product
    lines that aggregate into our three business segments described
    above.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 Spin-off in the form of a taxable pro rata
    dividend to our shareholders of all the shares of HSTX common
    stock owned by us, we eliminated as a reporting segment our
    former HSTX segment, which is reported as discontinued
    operations in this Report. Until the Spin-off, HSTX (formerly
    our Microwave Communications segment), a provider of wireless
    network solutions, was our majority-owned subsidiary, and
    HSTX’s results of operations and financial position were
    consolidated into our financial statements. Subsequent to the
    Spin-off, we no longer own an equity interest in HSTX and,
    therefore, HSTX no longer constitutes part of our business
    operations. Our historical financial results have been restated
    to account for HSTX as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in this Report. See

Note 3: Discontinued
    Operations

for additional information regarding discontinued
    operations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

. We evaluate each segment’s performance based
    on its “operating income (loss),” which we define as
    profit or loss from operations before income taxes excluding
    interest income and expense, royalties and related intellectual
    property expenses, equity income and gains or losses from
    securities and other investments. Intersegment sales among our
    segments are transferred at cost to the buying segment and the
    sourcing segment recognizes a normal profit that is eliminated.
    The “Corporate eliminations” line item in the tables
    below represents the elimination of intersegment sales and their
    related profits. The “Unallocated corporate expense”
    line item in the tables below represents the portion of
    corporate expenses not allocated to the business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
    States with international revenue derived primarily from
    exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
    exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2010,
    2009 or 2008.

Sales made to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD
    and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign
    military sales through the U.S. Government, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, by all segments
    (primarily our RF Communications and Government Communications
    Systems segments) as a percentage of total revenue were
    76.1 percent in fiscal 2010, 79.4 percent in fiscal
    2009 and 78.9 percent in fiscal 2008. Revenue from services
    in fiscal 2010 was approximately 6.8 percent,
    39.7 percent and 12.8 percent of total revenue in our
    RF Communications, Government Communications Systems and
    Broadcast Communications segments, respectively.

NOTE 26:

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
    of businesses in which we are, or were, engaged, various claims
    or charges are asserted and litigation or arbitration is
    commenced by or against us arising from or related to matters
    including, but not limited to: product liability; personal
    injury; patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual
    property; labor and employee disputes; commercial or contractual
    disputes; the sale or use of products containing asbestos or
    other restricted materials; breach of warranty; or environmental
    matters. Claimed amounts against us may be substantial but may
    not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim
    or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We
    typically record accruals for losses related to those matters
    against us that we consider to be probable and that can be
    reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized
    when they are realized and legal costs are expensed when
    incurred. While it is not feasible to



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, and some
    lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided
    unfavorably to us, based upon available information, in the
    opinion of management, settlements, arbitration awards and final
    judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
    rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
    July 2, 2010 are reserved for, covered by insurance or
    would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in
    jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result
    in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently
    resolved with the authorities or ultimately through established
    legal proceedings. We believe we have adequately accrued for any
    ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits;
    however, final assessments, if any, could be different from the
    amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 27:

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

On July 30, 2010, after the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    acquired privately held CapRock, a global provider of
    mission-critical, managed satellite communications services for
    the government, energy and maritime markets. CapRock’s
    highly reliable solutions include broadband Internet access,
    voice over Internet Protocol (“VOIP”) telephony,
    wideband networking and real-time video, delivered to nearly
    2,000 customer sites around the world. The acquisition of
    CapRock increased the breadth of our

assured
    communications

®

capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The purchase price for
    CapRock was $525 million in cash, subject to possible
    post-closing upward or downward adjustment. We funded the
    acquisition with $205 million of cash and $320 million
    of borrowings under our commercial paper program. We will report
    CapRock within our Government Communications Systems segment.
    For calendar year 2009, CapRock had revenue of $359 million
    and operating income of $28 million. All of the disclosures
    required by GAAP for business combinations have not been made
    for the CapRock acquisition because the accounting for the
    acquisition is still in progress.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
    the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the
    effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
    procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
    circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
    Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
    can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control
    objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures. As required by

Rule 13a-15

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2010, we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This
    evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this work
    and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has
    concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2010 our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We
    periodically review our internal control over financial
    reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal
    control over financial reporting to identify potential changes
    to our processes and systems that may improve controls and
    increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an
    effective internal control environment. Changes may include such
    activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
    consolidating the activities of business units, migrating
    certain processes to our shared services organizations,
    formalizing policies and procedures, improving segregation of
    duties, and adding additional monitoring controls. In addition,
    when we acquire new businesses, we incorporate our controls and
    procedures into the acquired business as part of our integration
    activities. There have been no changes in our internal control
    over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    July 2, 2010 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
    assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of the end of fiscal 2010 and concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of the end of fiscal 2010. “Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included
    within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report. The effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting was audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm. Their unqualified report is included within
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Report.

    be granted under the Harris Corporation Stock Incentive Plan or
    the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

(2)

Under the Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in
    addition to options, we have granted share-based compensation
    awards in the form of performance shares, restricted stock,
    performance share units, restricted stock units, or other
    similar types of share awards. As of July 2, 2010, there
    were 1,570,202 such awards outstanding under that plan. The
    outstanding awards consisted of (i) 1,435,439 performance
    share awards and restricted stock awards, for which all
    1,435,439 shares were issued and outstanding; and
    (ii) 134,763 performance share unit awards and restricted
    stock unit awards, for which all 134,763 were payable in shares
    but for which no shares were yet issued and outstanding. The
    7,162,272 shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding
    options, warrants and rights as listed in column
    (a) consisted of shares to be issued in respect of the
    exercise of 7,027,509 outstanding options and in respect of the
    134,763 performance share unit awards and restricted stock units
    awards payable in shares. Because there is no exercise price
    associated with performance share awards or restricted stock
