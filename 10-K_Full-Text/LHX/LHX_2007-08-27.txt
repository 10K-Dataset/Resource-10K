PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

HARRIS

Harris Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is an
    international communications and information technology company
    serving government and commercial markets in more than 150
    countries. We are focused on developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

tm

products, systems and services for global markets, including
    government communications, RF communications, broadcast
    communications and wireless transmission network solutions.

Harris was incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to
    three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal executive
    offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne,
    Florida 32919, and our telephone number is

(321) 727-9100.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “HRS.” On August 17, 2007, we employed
    approximately 16,000 people. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
    “us,” “Company,” and “Harris” as
    used in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

refer to Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries.

General

We structure our operations primarily around the markets we
    serve and for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, operated
    in the following four business segments: (1) Government
    Communications Systems, (2) RF Communications,
    (3) Broadcast Communications and (4) Harris Stratex
    Networks, Inc. (“Harris Stratex Networks”) (formerly
    Microwave Communications). As described in greater detail below
    under “Item 1. Business — Recent Acquisitions and
    Business Combinations,” in the third quarter of fiscal
    2007, we combined our former Microwave Communications Division
    with Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Stratex”), a
    publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless transmission
    systems, to form a new company named Harris Stratex Networks,
    Inc. We own approximately 57 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock and the minority stockholders
    own approximately 43 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock. Following that combination,
    our business segment formerly referred to as Microwave
    Communications is now referred to as Harris Stratex Networks.
    The results of the Harris Stratex Networks segment reflect the
    results of the combined business for periods following the
    combination. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

relate only to our continuing operations. Financial information
    with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate
    costs not allocated to the operating segments or discontinued
    operations, is reported as part of Headquarters Expense or
    Non-Operating Income (Loss).

Each of our business segments, which we also refer to as
    “divisions,” has been organized on the basis of
    specific communications markets. Each business segment has its
    own marketing, engineering, manufacturing and product service
    and maintenance organization. We produce most of the products we
    sell.



On May 21, 2007, we announced that effective for fiscal
    2008 (which began June 30, 2007), our segment reporting
    would be adjusted to reflect our new organizational structure.
    For fiscal 2008, our Department of Defense Programs area, part
    of our Government Communications Systems segment for fiscal
    2007, will be combined with our RF Communications business and
    reported as our Defense Communications and Electronics segment.
    As a result, our segment reporting for fiscal 2008 will consist
    of the following four business segments: (1) Government
    Communications Systems, (2) Defense Communications and
    Electronics, (3) Broadcast Communications, and
    (4) Harris Stratex Networks. Our Broadcast Communications
    and Harris Stratex Networks segments will not change as a result
    of the adjustments to our organizational structure. These
    adjustments to our segment reporting take effect in fiscal 2008
    and therefore do not affect the historical results, discussion
    or presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We will begin to report our financial results consistent with
    this new segment reporting structure beginning with the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008.

Our total revenue in fiscal 2007 was approximately
    $4.2 billion compared to approximately $3.5 billion in
    fiscal 2006. Total revenue in the United States increased
    approximately 20 percent from fiscal 2006 while
    international revenue, amounting to approximately
    23 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2007, increased
    approximately 29 percent from fiscal 2006. Our net income
    for fiscal 2007 was $480.4 million compared to
    $237.9 million in fiscal 2006.

Recent
    Acquisitions and Business Combinations

Combination of Our Former Microwave Communications
    Division With Stratex Networks, Inc.

On
    January 26, 2007, we completed the combination of our
    former Microwave Communications Division with Stratex, a
    publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless transmission
    systems, to form a new company named Harris Stratex Networks,
    Inc. The combination creates a global communications solutions
    company offering end-to-end wireless transmission solutions for
    mobile and fixed-wireless service providers and private
    networks. As part of the combination transaction, Harris Stratex
    Networks’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Stratex Merger Corp.,
    merged with and into Stratex, with Stratex as the surviving
    corporation. Pursuant to that merger, each share of Stratex
    common stock was converted into one-fourth of a share of Harris
    Stratex Networks Class A common stock. As a result,
    24,782,153 shares of Harris Stratex Networks Class A
    common stock were issued to the former holders of Stratex common
    stock, and Stratex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harris
    Stratex Networks. As part of the transaction, Stratex was
    renamed “Harris Stratex Networks Operating
    Corporation.” Also as part of the combination transaction,
    concurrently with the merger of Stratex Merger Corp. and
    Stratex, we contributed to Harris Stratex Networks the assets of
    our Microwave Communications Division, including
    $32.1 million in cash, and in exchange Harris Stratex
    Networks assumed substantially all of the liabilities related to
    our Microwave Communications Division and issued
    32,913,377 shares of Harris Stratex Networks Class B
    common stock to us. We own approximately 57 percent of
    Harris Stratex Networks’ outstanding stock and the minority
    stockholders own approximately 43 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock. Harris Stratex Networks is a
    publicly-traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under
    the symbol “HSTX.” The Stratex combination was
    accounted for as a purchase business combination with Harris as
    the purchaser for accounting purposes, and the purchase price
    was $493.0 million. The combination also resulted in a gain
    to us of approximately $163.4 million ($143.1 million
    after-tax), which relates to the deemed sale for accounting
    purposes of 43 percent of the assets and liabilities of our
    Microwave Communications Division to the minority stockholders
    of Harris Stratex Networks. The combined business is our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment.

Acquisition of Multimax Incorporated.

On
    June 15, 2007, we acquired Multimax Incorporated
    (“Multimax”), a provider of information technology and
    communications services and solutions supporting the Department
    of Defense (“DoD”), federal civilian agencies, and
    state and local governments. The purchase price for Multimax was
    $402 million, subject to possible post-closing upward or
    downward adjustment. We operate the Multimax business within our
    Government Communications Systems segment as part of the
    Information Technology Services Programs area. The acquisition
    has significantly expanded our information technology services
    business, providing greater scale, a broader customer base and
    new growth opportunities through key positions on several
    Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”).

Subsequent
    Event — Conversion of Convertible Debentures

On July 12, 2007, we notified The Bank of New York, as
    trustee, that we would redeem all of our outstanding
    3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022 in accordance with the
    terms of the Indenture dated as of August 26, 2002 between
    Harris and the trustee. The debentures would have been redeemed
    for cash on August 20, 2007, at a redemption price of
    100 percent of the principal amount of the debentures, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
    redemption date. However, prior to the date set for redemption,
    all of the debentures were converted by the holders into shares
    of our common stock at a conversion rate of 44.2404 shares
    of common stock



for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures, with the
    exception of debentures in the principal amount of $3,000. This
    resulted in the issuance by us of 6,594,146 shares of
    common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in respect
    of the debentures converted. On August 20, 2007, we
    redeemed the remaining debentures in the principal amount of
    $3,000. Accordingly, no debentures remain outstanding as of
    August 20, 2007.

    2007, the Government Communications Systems segment served four
    strategic program areas:

Department of Defense Programs:

Government
    Communications Systems is a major supplier of spaceborne,
    airborne and terrestrial communications and information
    processing systems. Government Communications Systems provides
    military satellite communications, high-speed data links and
    data networks, avionics, mobile ad hoc networked communications,
    large deployable satellite antenna systems, and flat-panel,
    phased-array and single-mission antennas. Government

    military communications. The DoD’s Global Information Grid
    will provide forces with access to information when and where
    they need it via secure, interoperable and mobile communications
    networks. A key element of this information grid is the
    U.S. Army’s Warfighter Information Network —
    Tactical (“WIN-T”), for which Government
    Communications Systems is providing secure, high-speed, wireless
    local area networking and high-capacity mobile ad hoc networking
    capabilities for WIN-T’s wireless transmission system.
    Government Communications Systems is developing next-generation
    communication electronics in support of the DoD’s
    Transformational Communications Satellite program. Government
    Communications Systems is developing network-centric
    communications system architectures and technologies that will
    link sensors, platforms, weapons and soldiers. It is also
    developing open-architecture, directional, mobile ad hoc
    networking capabilities.

During fiscal 2007, Government Communications Systems was
    awarded significant contracts, including: a three-year,
    $66 million contract by the U.S. Navy for
    pre-production and test of the Ku-band Common Data Link
    (“CDL”) Hawklink high-speed digital data link system
    for the MH-60R Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System
    (“LAMPS”) helicopter; a four-year, $33.5 million
    follow-on contract from ViaSat, Inc. for additional hardware
    (including enhanced voice card, power supply assemblies,
    processor modules and the terminal chassis) for integration into
    the Multifunctional Information Distribution System
    (“MIDS”) Low Volume Terminals (“LVT”) that
    provide U.S. military forces with secure, jam-resistant,
    digital tactical communications, and for comprehensive
    environmental testing of the completed terminal assemblies,
    which follow-on award brings the overall value of the contract
    to us to $140 million; a

12-month

contract by the U.S. Navy to provide a Multiband Shipboard
    Satellite Communications Terminal (“MSSCT”) for the
    Lockheed Martin Littoral Combat Ship,which is the second MSSCT
    award to Harris for the Littoral Combat Ship program (Harris is
    providing satellite communications terminal systems for both
    Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, which are competing for
    the ultimate production award); a nine-month, $12.5 million
    contract by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems to provide the
    Distributed Targeting



Processor (“DTP”) and the companion Mass Storage Unit
    (“MSU”) for the U.S. Navy’s

Super Hornet aircraft, which avionics improve network-centric
    operations capability and shorten the time from target sensing
    to shooting and enhance precision targeting by applying advanced
    geo-referencing capabilities.

Also during fiscal 2007, Government Communications Systems
    released for purchase, together with BAE Systems, their
    co-developed Highband Networking Radio (“HNR”) that
    provides true ad hoc, mobile capabilities to network-centric
    military communications by providing fully mobile,
    high-bandwidth, long-range, line-of-sight connectivity between

    (“LANs”). Government Communications Systems also
    delivered the first 12 of 39 Large Aperture Multiband Deployable
    Antenna (“LAMDA”) rugged, highly-mobile satellite
    communications terminals for the U.S. Marine Corps and
    U.S. Air Force as part of a $42 million contract
    awarded to Harris in 2004 by the U.S. Army that also
    includes 25 Lightweight High Gain X-band Antenna
    (“LHGXA”) terminals. Ongoing previously awarded
    programs include: a contract to upgrade strategic satellite
    communications terminals for the U.S. Army; a contract to
    upgrade lightweight multiband satellite communications terminals
    for the U.S. Marine Corps; a contract with the

    (the first MSSCT award); contracts for portions of the
    communications systems for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
    (“GMD”) program (formerly known as National Missile
    Defense); follow-on awards for the U.S. Army’s
    Multiple Launch Rocket System program, including improved fire
    control systems (“IFCS”); a contract for MIDS
    terminals for aircraft such as the U.S. Navy’s

F/A-18

and
    the U.S. Air Force’s F-16, as well as ground-based

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft platforms to
    provide high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed
    fiber optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links,
    image processing, digital map software and other electronic
    components.

As noted above under “Item 1. Business —
    General,” the Department of Defense Programs area will be
    reported as part of our new Defense Communications and
    Electronics segment beginning with the first quarter of fiscal
    2008.

National Intelligence Programs:

Government
    Communications Systems is a provider of communications equipment
    and systems and image and information processing solutions to
    national intelligence and security agencies and customers.
    Government Communications Systems provides comprehensive
    solutions for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance,
    addressing each of the six steps of the intelligence cycle:
    tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and
    analysis of information. Government Communications Systems
    provides communications equipment, advanced imagery products and
    information processing for intelligence systems. It also
    develops and supplies state-of-the-art wireless surveillance and
    tracking equipment for vehicular, man-portable, airborne, and
    remote/unattended applications. Such integrated intelligence and
    surveillance solutions help improve situational awareness, data
    collection accuracy and product analysis by correlating near
    real-time mission data and intelligence reference data for
    display and analysis by strategic and tactical planners and
    decision makers. A significant portion of this business involves
    classified programs. While classified programs generally are not
    discussed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our consolidated financial statements. The business
    risks associated with such programs do not differ materially
    from those of other U.S. Government programs. During fiscal
    2007, we were awarded several new programs and follow-on
    contracts with national intelligence customers. Ongoing
    previously awarded programs include: a contract with Space
    Systems/Loral to design and construct unfurlable mesh reflectors
    for commercial satellites; a contract with the NSA for the
    Rapidly Deployable Integrated Command and Control System
    (“RADIC”) program pursuant to which we are developing
    a knowledge-management software system for NSA’s analysts.
    Government Communications Systems is also supplying geospatial
    and imagery-derived products for the NGA under the Global
    Geospatial Intelligence program, including foundation data
    products, three-dimensional visualization, mapping and charting
    production services, surveying services and production
    management.

Civil Programs:

Government Communications
    Systems is a supplier to civilian agencies of the
    U.S. Government, including the FAA and the Census Bureau,
    supplying these agencies with custom systems and software
    designed to collect, store, retrieve, process, analyze,
    interpret, display and distribute information, including
    meteorological data processing systems, electronic archival
    systems, graphic information systems and telecommunication
    services systems. Government Communications Systems provides
    systems integration to large-scale, geographically dispersed
    enterprises.

For example, Government Communications Systems is assisting the
    FAA in modernizing the U.S. air traffic control system and
    infrastructure. We are the prime contractor on a

15-year,

$2.2 billion contract to integrate and



modernize the FAA’s Telecommunications Infrastructure
    (“FTI”). This program is consolidating
    telecommunications at more than 4,400 FAA facilities nationwide,
    while reducing operating costs, enhancing network efficiency,
    reliability and security and improving service. During fiscal
    2005, we were awarded a further contract by the FAA to add
    mission support services to the FTI program, as well as a
    follow-on contract for the FAA’s Weather and Advanced Radar
    Processing System. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we
    completed the transition of FTI’s new satellite network to
    serve operational requirements and the new mission support
    network that provides the FAA’s administrative functions.
    The total contract amount for the FTI program, including
    options, could reach $3.5 billion through 2017. Government
    Communications Systems is also working with the FAA on other
    programs, including the Voice Switching and Control System
    program, which allows air traffic controllers to establish
    critical air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communications with
    pilots as well as other air traffic controllers.

Government Communications Systems is a developer of complex,
    large-scale databases and information systems and services.
    Government Communications Systems is the prime contractor for
    the U.S. Census Bureau’s Master Address
    File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
    Referencing Accuracy Improvement Project (“MTAIP”).
    The MTAIP contract was awarded to Harris in 2002 and during
    fiscal 2006 the U.S. Census Bureau exercised its option to
    extend the contract for four years. The MTAIP program will
    provide a computer database of all addresses and locations in
    the U.S. where people live or work, covering an estimated
    115 million residences and 60 million businesses in
    the U.S. During fiscal 2006, Government Communications
    Systems was awarded a five-year, $600 million contract from
    the U.S. Census Bureau as prime contractor for its Field
    Data Collection Automation (“FDCA”) program. Under the
    FDCA program, Government Communications Systems is integrating

    communications functions at Schriever AFB, Colorado, and Onizuka
    AFS, California; a contract under the Operational Space Services
    and Support (“OSSS”) program, pursuant to which
    Government Communications Systems provides operations and
    maintenance services to the Air Force Satellite Control Network
    remote tracking stations and global positioning satellite sites
    worldwide. During fiscal 2007, Government Communications Systems
    was awarded a

12-month,

$42 million follow-on contract by the U.S. Department
    of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs to provide technical
    support services to more than 230 U.S. embassies and
    consulates around the world (“State 6”), including
    providing complete systems and operational support related to
    the high-volume business applications of the consulates and
    embassies, such as processing of approximately 5 million
    visa applications annually and other services required to
    support United States citizens living or traveling abroad. In
    support of this ongoing program for information technology
    systems and service modernization, Government Communications
    Systems provides system configuration management, system
    upgrades, help desk services, web development and training, and
    its support services benefit border protection initiatives with
    the addition of biometric technology to the visa application
    process. Also during fiscal 2007, we acquired Multimax. As noted
    above, we operate Multimax as part of our Information Technology
    Services Programs area. Multimax’s customers, including the
    U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, DHS, Department
    of State, Department of Veterans Affairs and FAA, broaden the
    customer base of our Information Technology Services Programs
    area. The acquisition of Multimax provides new growth
    opportunities through its key positions on major contracts, such
    as the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (“NMCI”) program,
    and GWACs including NETCENTS, EAGLE, ITES-2S and FirstSource,
    which are information technology procurement vehicles broadly
    accessible by U.S. Government agencies.



Revenue, Backlog and Contracts:

Revenue in
    fiscal 2007 for the Government Communications Systems segment
    increased 10 percent to $1,997 million from
    $1,813 million in fiscal 2006 and was $1,805 million
    in fiscal 2005. Segment operating income increased
    4 percent to $225.6 million from $216.5 million
    in fiscal 2006 and was $203.4 million in fiscal 2005. This
    segment contributed 47 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2007, 52 percent in fiscal 2006 and 60 percent
    in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007, approximately 30 percent of
    the revenue for this segment was under contracts with prime
    contractors and approximately 70 percent was under direct
    contracts with customers, compared to 33 percent of revenue
    under contracts with prime contractors and 67 percent of
    revenue under direct contracts with customers in fiscal 2006.
    Some of this segment’s more significant programs in fiscal
    2007 included the FTI program, the Patriot program, the FDCA
    program, the MCOM program, the

F/A-18E/F

Super Hornet platform and various classified programs. Other
    significant programs included the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
    platform, IFCS, MTAIP, MIDS and several classified programs. The
    largest program by revenue represented approximately
    12 percent of this segment’s revenue for fiscal 2007,
    compared to approximately 10 percent for fiscal 2006. The
    10 largest programs by revenue represented approximately
    38 percent of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2007,
    33 percent in fiscal 2006 and approximately 31 percent
    in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007, this segment had a diverse
    portfolio of over 300 programs. Historically, this diversity has
    provided a stable backlog and reduced potential risks that come
    from reductions in funding or changes in customer priorities. In
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, U.S. Government customers, whether
    directly or through prime contractors, accounted for
    approximately 95 percent of this segment’s total
    revenue, with the DoD accounting for 39 percent of this
    segment’s fiscal 2007 revenue and the FAA accounting for
    15 percent.

The funded backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $402 million at July 27, 2007, compared with
    $382 million at July 28, 2006 and $410 million at
    July 29, 2005. Substantially all this funded backlog is
    expected to be filled during fiscal 2008, but we can give no
    assurance of such fulfillment. Unfunded backlog for this segment
    was $4,147 million at July 27, 2007, compared with
    $4,159 million at July 28, 2006 and
    $4,019 million at July 29, 2005. Additional
    information regarding funded and unfunded backlog for this
    segment is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Funded and Unfunded Backlog.”

Most of the sales of the Government Communications Systems
    segment are made directly or indirectly to the
    U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts containing
    standard government contract clauses providing for
    redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
    based upon performance. This segment’s contracts include
    both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts.
    Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of
    allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. These contracts fall
    into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts,
    which provide for the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the
    final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee
    contracts, which provide for increases or decreases in the fee,
    within specified limits, based upon actual results compared to
    contractual targets relating to factors such as cost,
    performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus
    award-fee contracts, which provide for the payment of an award
    fee determined at the discretion of the customer based upon the
    performance of the contractor against pre-established
    performance criteria. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, this
    segment is reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and is
    paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some
    overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable
    for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples are certain
    merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs and certain
    litigation defense costs.

This segment’s fixed-price contracts are either firm
    fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
    firm fixed-price contracts, this segment agrees to perform a
    specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result,
    benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of cost
    overruns. Under fixed-price incentive contracts, this segment
    shares with the U.S. Government both savings accrued from
    contracts performed for less than target costs as well as costs
    incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price
    (which is higher than the target cost), but carries the entire
    burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
    Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be
    adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified performance
    objectives are met. Under firm fixed-price and fixed-price
    incentive contracts, this segment usually receives either
    milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract
    price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government
    in amounts equaling 75 percent of costs incurred under
    U.S. Government contracts. The remaining amounts, including
    profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final
    acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract.
    Fixed-price contracts generally have higher profit margins than
    cost-reimbursement contracts. Production contracts are mainly
    fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are generally
    cost-reimbursement contracts. For fiscal 2007, 51 percent
    of the revenue of this segment was generated from
    cost-reimbursement contracts and 49 percent was generated
    from fixed-price contracts compared to 52 percent and
    48 percent, respectively, in fiscal 2006 and
    60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in fiscal
    2005. GWAC and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity
    (“IDIQ”) contracts, which can include task orders for
    each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial



contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under
    the contract. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this
    segment, see “Item 1. Business — Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

RF Communications is a worldwide supplier of secure voice and
    data radio communications products, systems and networks to the
    DoD, other Federal and state agencies, and allied government
    defense and peacekeeping forces. RF Communications offers a
    comprehensive line of secure radio products and systems for
    manpack, handheld, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard
    applications. These radio systems are highly flexible,
    interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission
    requirements.

RF Communications’
    Falcon

®

family of software-defined tactical radios includes the
    Falcon II secure high-frequency, very high-frequency, ultra
    high-frequency and multiband handheld, manpack and vehicular
    radio systems, and the Falcon III multiband, multimode,
    multimission handheld, manpack, vehicular and high-capacity data
    radios and secure personal role radio with wideband networking
    capability. These radios are built on a software-defined radio
    platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software
    upgrades. Software-defined radio technology offers significantly
    increased flexibility in support of a variety of wireless
    communications protocols. This common-platform, software-based
    system addresses the increasing need for an integrated
    high-frequency, very high-frequency and ultra high-frequency
    communication system. It also provides interconnectivity among
    land-based and wireless communications media. These radios also
    have military-strength embedded encryption and can be linked to
    computers, providing network capabilities on the battlefield.

The Falcon III multiband handheld is the first tactical
    radio to be certified without waivers by the Joint Program
    Executive Office (“JPEO”) as fully compliant with the
    Software Communications Architecture (“SCA”) of the
    Joint Tactical Radio System (“JTRS”). The
    Falcon III handheld radio also has been certified by the
    NSA for the protection of voice and data traffic up through TOP
    SECRET/SCI level. Falcon III radios provide multimode
    capability, including secure ground-to-ground, ground-to-air,
    and long-range tactical satellite communications.
    Falcon III radios can be configured to accommodate
    vehicle-mounted functionality while providing handheld
    portability. Falcon III radios address a full range of
    evolving mission requirements, including backwards compatibility
    and interoperability with legacy systems, such as Single Channel
    Ground and Airborne Systems (“SINCGARS”), and are
    software upgradeable to incorporate new waveforms as they are
    developed. In fiscal 2007, RF Communications introduced the
    Falcon III multiband, multimission, manpack tactical radio
    which combines traditional multiband radio features with new
    capabilities such as commercial L-Band SATCOM and wideband
    mobile ad hoc networking; the very small and lightweight
    Falcon III secure personal role radio, which provides
    secure, digitized voice and data communications to an
    individual, and with wideband networking capability; and a
    high-capacity, line-of-site (“HCLOS”) radio, which is
    a lightweight, broadband, Ethernet system to securely transmit
    Internet Protocol (“IP”) traffic up to 50 kilometers
    and support throughput in excess of 70 megabits.

RF Communications also provides tactical networking and data
    products which provide highly integrated and secure
    communications over high-frequency, very high-frequency and
    ultra high-frequency radio links. Key product areas include
    advanced networking interfaces, efficient email and image
    transmission software and advanced, high-frequency modems. For
    example, RF Communications’ tactical network access hub,
    together with the Falcon II radios, form the basis of the
    Harris Tactical Network that allows radio operators to send and
    receive phone calls and allows radio outstations to have
    wireless IP connectivity, extending telecommunication and
    local/wide area data networks down to the tactical radio level.
    These voice and data communications are secured by digital
    encryption. RF Communications’ wireless email and messaging
    systems, the Harris Wireless Gateway and Wireless Message
    Terminal, transfer electronic mail and files in a secure
    environment over high-frequency, very high-frequency and ultra
    high-frequency radio, landline, facsimile or satellite. These
    reliable and flexible email and messaging applications
    complement customers’ existing communications
    infrastructure and adhere to Federal and military standard
    high-frequency protocols. RF Communications’ digital video
    imaging products and systems include software for fast and
    reliable transmission of high-resolution digital imagery, motion
    video clips, text and other data over tactical radio
    communications channels.

RF Communications also develops encryption solutions for markets
    with demanding communications security requirements, utilizing
    security algorithms that meet a wide range of applications

and/or

country needs to address unique privacy requirements of
    customers (whether a government agency or supplier or a
    commercial manufacturer) and providing NSA-certified products
    and systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems. RF Communications’
    Sierra

tm

II cryptographic subsystem is a miniaturized programmable module
    that can be integrated into radios and other voice and data
    communications devices to encrypt classified information prior
    to transmission and storage. Sierra II was certified in
    fiscal 2005 by the NSA. RF



Communications’ encryption modules currently meet or exceed
    the highest security standards established by the
    U.S. Government. Sierra II can be used for tactical
    radios, wireless local area networks (“WLANs”), remote
    sensors, guided munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles. RF
    Communications also offers the
    Citadel

®

cryptographic engine which provides military grade, Type IV
    encryption, providing the ability for exportable encryption at a
    low cost for our family of Falcon II radios. RF
    Communications’ secure WLAN solution, SecNet

®

Plus, is certified by the NSA’s Commercial COMSEC
    Endorsement Program (“CCEP”) and enables military and
    government users to communicate multimedia information,
    including data, voice and video, through a secure wireless
    network at 11 megabits per second. Leveraging the Sierra
    encryption module, SecNet 11 Plus enables government agencies to
    use commercial, state-of-the-art WLAN technology in a secure
    environment. RF Communications’ new SecNet

tm

family of IP communications encryption products, designed to
    keep data, voice and video communications secure, is comprised
    of a modular architecture with two components: a cryptographic
    module that provides all security-critical functions and an
    external module that handles the transport of encrypted data
    over specific protocols. In fiscal 2007, RF Communications
    received Type 1 certification from the NSA for the new SecNet 54
    Secure Wireless Local Area Network product line, which enables
    transmission of sensitive defense communications over wireless
    infrastructures in applications such as tactical operations
    centers.

RF Communications also provides unattended ground sensor
    systems, which are a force-multiplier solution with a network of
    easily deployable, remotely located products that detect
    movement of personnel and vehicles. RF Communications’
    Falcon
    Watch

tm

remote intrusion detection and surveillance systems are fully
    integrated with Falcon II radios and are designed for
    surveillance and monitoring of high-value assets such as troop
    encampments, airfields, base installations, supply routes and
    depots. In larger networks it also can be used to monitor and
    protect national borders, regional boundaries and assets in
    homeland defense and peacekeeping operations. These sensor
    systems can be comprised of remote, battery-operated, wireless
    sensors using seismic, magnetic

and/or

passive infra-red detectors; relays; Falcon tactical radios; and
    sensor management application software.

The worldwide transformation to modernize and expand tactical
    communications capabilities to provide secure, interoperable and
    reliable communications continues to drive strong demand and
    positive results for this segment. Force modernization efforts,
    including ground force restructuring and expansion, have shown
    continued momentum and funding as the DoD continues to place a
    high priority on investment in tactical communications, seeking
    to deliver enhanced command, control and communications to more
    and smaller operating units. In fiscal 2007, RF Communications
    responded to requirements for its Falcon family of radios from a
    broad base of U.S. Government customers, including the
    U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force.
    Internationally, RF Communications’ radios are the standard
    of NATO and Partnership for Peace countries. Orders in fiscal
    2007 were received from Kenya, the United Kingdom, Algeria,
    Iraq, Canada, Romania, Poland, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Belgium,
    Bulgaria, Denmark, the Republic of Georgia, the Netherlands,
    Afghanistan, Singapore and Nigeria.

In May 2007, RF Communications was awarded an IDIQ contract with
    a maximum value of $422 million from the U.S. Army for
    Falcon II HF manpack tactical radios and related vehicular
    and base station systems. RF Communications received an initial
    $104 million order against the contract in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007. In June 2007, RF Communications was
    awarded an IDIQ contract by the JTRS JPEO to supply the DoD with
    JTRS-approved Falcon III multiband handheld tactical radios
    and vehicular systems. The contract has a one-year maximum value
    of $2.7 billion and a five-year maximum value of
    approximately $7 billion (including additional options that
    may be exercised over a five-year period). Under the contract,
    orders will be awarded based on competitive bidding between RF
    Communications and one other supplier.

Revenue in fiscal 2007 for the RF Communications segment
    increased 46 percent to $1,179 million from
    $809 million in fiscal 2006 and was $537 million in
    fiscal 2005. Segment operating income increased 45 percent
    to $403.2 million in fiscal 2007, compared to
    $278.9 million in fiscal 2006 and was $166.5 million
    in fiscal 2005. The RF Communications segment contributed
    27 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2007,
    23 percent in fiscal 2006 and 17 percent in fiscal
    2005. In fiscal 2007, approximately 28 percent of the
    revenue of this segment was derived outside of the United
    States, compared to 37 percent in fiscal 2006 and
    45 percent in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007,
    U.S. Government customers, whether directly or through
    others, accounted for approximately 76 percent of this
    segment’s total revenue, compared to 72 percent in
    fiscal 2006 and 54 percent in fiscal 2005.

In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through
    regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
    See “Item 1. Business — International
    Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $767 million at July 27, 2007, compared to
    $703 million at July 28, 2006 and $427 million at
    July 29, 2005. Approximately 85 percent of this
    backlog of unfilled orders is



expected to be filled during fiscal 2008, but we can give no
    assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of certain risks
    affecting this segment, see “Item 1.
    Business — Principal Customers; Government
    Contracts,” “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

As noted above under “Item 1. Business —
    General,” the RF Communications segment will be combined
    with our Department of Defense Programs area and reported as
    part of our new Defense Communications and Electronics segment
    beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

    with a smooth path from analog to digital broadcasting.
    Broadcast Communications is also a provider of European-standard
    digital “DVB-T” transmission equipment.

Broadcast Communications is also expanding efforts to reach the
    emerging mobile television market under the concept of
    transmitting real-time television to personal devices such as
    cell phones, PDAs or other mobile devices. Broadcast
    Communications is developing and providing transmission
    equipment for various mobile video broadcasting trials in
    Australia, China, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the
    U.S. Recent advances in compression and transmission
    technology (two areas in which Broadcast Communications has been
    a leader) will allow broadcasters to deliver content
    representative of typical live broadcast television programming,
    as opposed to the short video clips that are the current
    standard in mobile video. In fiscal 2007, Broadcast
    Communications and LG Electronics Inc. introduced the
    jointly-developed
    MPH

tm

in-band mobile DTV system
    (“Mobile-Pedestrian-Handheld” or “MPH”), a
    new technology capable of providing DTV signals and extending
    over-the-air broadcast TV signals beyond customary TV viewing at
    home to mobile, pedestrian and other handheld devices (such as
    mobile phones or laptop computers).

Broadcast Communications’ radio transmission product
    offerings include digital and analog radio transmission systems,
    radio studio systems and consoles, and many proprietary
    technologies that reduce the cost of conversion to digital
    transmission and enable such new services as surround sound and
    multi-channel operation. Broadcast Communications can provide
    single products or complete systems that range from single-radio
    studios to consolidated operations and complete nationwide
    networks with hundreds of radio transmitters. Its solutions are
    scalable to meet the needs of radio broadcasters of different
    sizes. Broadcast Communications is a leader in the transition
    from analog to digital radio. Product offerings address the
    U.S. digital standard called “IBOC”
    (In-Band/On-Channel), which is referred to in the market as
    “HD
    Radio

®

”,
    as well as international digital standards including
    “DAB” (Digital Audio Broadcasting) and “DRM”
    (Digital Radio Mondiale). The rollout of HD Radio in the
    U.S. continues to progress with approximately 1,400
    stations currently on-air with HD Radio and approximately 1,900
    of the approximately 12,000 remaining radio stations expected to
    implement HD Radio over the next several years. Radio
    transmission products include the
    FLEXSTAR

tm

family, which provides a bandwidth-efficient bitstream so
    broadcasters can offer supplemental audio and data capability
    along with the main program stream. This enables broadcasters to
    develop new revenue-generating opportunities including multiple
    programs on the same channel, 5.1 surround sound, on-demand
    traffic, weather and sports reports,

store-and-play

capabilities and real-time navigation. During the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, we exited our radio resale distribution channel,
    which involved sales of non-Harris OEM radio products at low
    gross margins, sold primarily through a telemarketing group.

Revenue for the Broadcast Communications segment increased
    11 percent from $538 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $600 million in fiscal 2007 and was $384 million in
    fiscal 2005. Segment operating income was $11.9 million in
    fiscal 2007, compared to $22.8 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $18.1 million in fiscal 2005. The Broadcast Communications
    segment contributed 14 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2007, 15 percent in fiscal 2006 and 12 percent
    in fiscal 2005. Approximately 46 percent of the revenue of
    this segment was derived outside of the United States in fiscal
    2007, compared to 41 percent in fiscal 2006 and
    34 percent in fiscal 2005. Principal customers for
    Broadcast Communications’ products and services include
    domestic and international television and radio broadcast
    stations; cable and satellite networks and service providers;
    telecommunications providers; Federal agencies; public safety
    entities; advertising agencies; and content originators. No
    single customer accounted for more than 2 percent of fiscal
    2007 revenue for the Broadcast Communications segment.



In general, this segment’s domestic products are sold and
    serviced directly to customers through its sales organization
    and through established distribution channels. Internationally,
    this segment markets and sells its products and services through
    regional sales offices and established distribution channels.
    See “Item 1. Business — International
    Business.”

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $323 million at July 27, 2007, compared with
    $240 million at July 28, 2006 and $210 million at
    July 29, 2005. Approximately 66 percent of this
    backlog is expected to be filled during fiscal 2008, but we can
    give no assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of
    certain risks affecting this segment, see “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings.”

Harris
    Stratex Networks

As described in greater detail above under “Item 1.
    Business — Recent Acquisitions and Business
    Combinations,” in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we
    combined our former Microwave Communications Division with
    Stratex to form Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. We own
    approximately 57 percent of Harris Stratex Networks’
    outstanding stock and the minority stockholders own
    approximately 43 percent. Following the combination, our
    business segment formerly referred to as Microwave
    Communications is now referred to as Harris Stratex Networks and
    includes the results of the combined business for periods
    following the combination.

Harris Stratex Networks is a global independent supplier of
    turnkey wireless transmission network solutions. Harris Stratex
    Networks offers reliable, flexible, scalable and cost-efficient
    wireless transmission network solutions, including microwave
    radio systems and network management software, which are backed

    Harris Stratex Networks’ wireless transmission systems
    deliver regional and country-wide backbone in developing
    nations, where microwave radio installations provide

st

-century
    communications rapidly and economically. Rural communities,
    areas with rugged terrain and regions with extreme temperatures
    benefit from the ability to build an advanced, affordable
    communications infrastructure despite these challenges.

Network Operations:

Harris Stratex Networks
    serves the network operations market by offering a wide range of
    software-based network management solutions for network
    operators worldwide, from element management to turnkey,
    end-to-end network management and service assurance solutions

    converged networks. Harris Stratex Networks develops, designs,
    produces, sells and services network management systems,
    including the
    NetBoss

®

product line, for these applications. Other element management
    product families include
    ProVision

®

and
    StarView

tm

.

In general, wireless transmission networks are constructed using
    microwave radios and other equipment to connect cell sites,
    switching systems, land mobile radio systems, wireline
    transmission systems and other fixed-access facilities and other
    communications systems. Wireless networks range in size from a
    single transmission link connecting two buildings to complex
    networks comprised of thousands of wireless connections. The
    architecture of a network is influenced by several factors,
    including the available radio frequency spectrum, coordination
    of frequencies with existing infrastructure, application
    requirements, environmental factors and local geography. For
    many applications, microwave systems offer a lower-cost,
    highly-reliable and more easily deployable alternative to
    competing wireline transmission media, such as fiber, copper or
    coaxial cable.



Harris Stratex Networks’ principal product families of
    licensed point-to-point microwave radios include
    Eclipse

tm

,
    a platform for nodal wireless transmission systems, and
    TRuepoint

®

,
    a platform for high-performance point-to-point wireless
    communications. The Eclipse product line combines wireless
    transmission functions with network processing node functions,
    including many functions that, for non-nodal products, would
    have to be purchased separately. System functions include voice,
    data and video transport, node management, multiplexing, routing
    and cross-connection. Eclipse is designed to simplify complex
    networks and lower the total cost of ownership over the product
    life. With frequency coverage from 5 to 38 gigahertz, low to
    high-capacity operation and traditional time-division
    multiplexing and Ethernet transmission capabilities, Eclipse is
    designed to support a wide range of long- and short-haul
    applications. Eclipse is software-configurable, enabling easy
    capacity upgrades, and gives users the ability to plan and
    deploy networks and adapt to changing conditions at minimal cost
    and disruption. Harris Stratex Networks’ TRuepoint product
    family offers full

plug-and-play,

software programmable microwave radio configuration. It delivers
    service from 4 to 180 megabits per second capacity at
    frequencies ranging from 6 to 38 gigahertz. TRuepoint is
    designed to meet the current and future needs of network
    operators, including mobile, private network, government and
    access service providers. The unique architecture of the core
    platform reduces both capital expenditures and life cycle costs,
    while meeting international and North American standards. The
    software-based architecture enables migration from traditional
    microwave access applications to higher-capacity transport
    interconnections. Harris Stratex Networks also offers two
    license-exempt point-to-point microwave radio product families.

Harris Stratex Networks’ network management product
    families include NetBoss, ProVision and StarView. These product
    families offer a broad set of choices for all levels of network
    management, from enterprise-wide management and service
    assurance to element management. NetBoss is a family of network
    management and service assurance solutions for managing
    multi-vendor, multi-technology communications networks. NetBoss
    supports wireless and wireline networks of many types, offering
    fault management, performance management, service activation and
    assurance, billing mediation and operational support system
    (“OSS”) integration. As a modular, off-the-shelf
    product, it enables customers to implement management systems
    immediately or gradually, as their needs dictate. NetBoss XE
    offers advanced element management. NetBoss products are
    optimized to work seamlessly with Harris Stratex Networks
    digital microwave radios, such as the TRuepoint family, but can
    also be customized to manage products based on any network or
    computing technology. The ProVision element manager is a
    centralized network monitoring and control system optimized for
    Eclipse and TRuepoint products.

Approximately 66 percent of the revenue of this segment was
    derived outside of the United States in fiscal 2007, compared to
    57 percent in fiscal 2006 and 46 percent in fiscal
    2005. This segment generally sells its North American products
    and services directly to customers through its sales
    organization and through established distribution channels. In
    international markets, this segment markets and sells its
    products and services through regional sales offices and
    established distribution channels, using agents and
    distributors. See “Item 1. Business —
    International Business.”

Revenue in fiscal 2007 for the Harris Stratex Networks segment
    increased 46 percent from $349 million in fiscal 2006
    to $508 million in fiscal 2007 and was $320 million in
    fiscal 2005. This segment had operating income of
    $146.9 million in fiscal 2007, compared to an operating
    loss of $19.6 million in fiscal 2006 and operating income
    of $7.7 million in fiscal 2005. This segment contributed
    12 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2007,
    10 percent in fiscal 2006 and 11 percent in fiscal
    2005.

The backlog of unfilled orders for this segment was
    $232 million at July 27, 2007, compared with
    $164 million at July 28, 2006 and $94 million at
    July 29, 2005. Substantially all of this backlog is
    expected to be filled during fiscal 2008, but we can give no
    assurance of such fulfillment. For a discussion of certain risks
    affecting this segment, see “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

International
    Business

Revenue in fiscal 2007 from products exported from the United
    States (including foreign military sales) or manufactured abroad
    was $964.4 million (23 percent of our total revenue),
    compared with $746.5 million (21 percent of our total
    revenue) in fiscal 2006 and $559.0 million (19 percent
    of our total revenue) in fiscal 2005. Our international sales
    include both direct exports from the United States and sales
    from foreign subsidiaries. Most of the international sales are
    derived from the Harris Stratex Networks, RF Communications and
    Broadcast Communications segments. Direct export sales are
    primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas sales from
    foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local
    currency of the subsidiary. Exports from the United States,
    principally to Europe, Africa, Canada, Latin America and Asia,
    totaled $613.9 million (64 percent of our
    international revenue) in fiscal 2007, $418.0 million
    (56 percent of our international revenue) in fiscal 2006
    and $326.6 million (58 percent of our international
    revenue) in fiscal 2005. Foreign operations represented
    8 percent of



revenue in fiscal 2007, 9 percent of revenue in fiscal 2006
    and 8 percent of revenue in fiscal 2005. Foreign operations
    represented 28 percent of long-lived assets as of
    June 29, 2007 and 24 percent of long-lived assets as
    of June 30, 2006. Financial information regarding our
    domestic and international operations is contained in

Note


: Business Segments

in the Notes and
    is incorporated herein by reference.

Principal international manufacturing facilities are located in
    Canada, China and the United Kingdom. The majority of our
    international marketing activities are conducted through
    subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, Central and South
    America and Asia. We have also established international
    marketing organizations and several regional sales offices.
    Reference is made to Exhibit 21 “Subsidiaries of the
    Registrant” for further information regarding our foreign
    subsidiaries.

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers,
    distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and
    sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically
    and internationally. These independent representatives may buy
    for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or
    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the independent representative and may be above
    or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally
    receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those
    prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.
    During fiscal 2007, revenue from indirect sales channels
    represented 9 percent of our total revenue and
    32 percent of our international revenue, compared to
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2006 representing
    6 percent of our total revenue and 23 percent of our
    international revenue.

Fiscal 2007 revenue came from a large number of foreign
    countries, of which no single country accounted for
    3 percent or more of our total revenue. Some of our exports
    are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried
    either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance
    payments, progress payments or other similar payments received
    prior to, or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs
    incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally
    require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to stay
    competitive in international markets, we also enter into
    recourse and vendor financing to facilitate sales to certain
    customers.

The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Nevertheless, in the
    opinion of our management, these risks are offset by the
    diversification of the international business and the protection
    provided by letters of credit and advance payments.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
    management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are cost-effectiveness, product
    quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service,
    past performance, ability to develop and implement complex,
    integrated solutions, ability to meet delivery schedules and the
    effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international
    areas.

In the Government Communications Systems segment principal
    competitors include: Accenture, BAE Systems, Boeing, Computer
    Sciences, General Dynamics, ITT Industries, L-3 Communications,
    Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins
    and SAIC. Consolidation among U.S. defense and aerospace
    companies has resulted in a reduction in the number of principal
    prime contractors. As a result of this consolidation, we
    frequently “partner” or are involved in subcontracting
    and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to
    time, competitors on other programs.

In the RF Communications segment principal competitors include:
    General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Raytheon, Rohde &
    Schwarz, Tadiran and Thales.

In the Broadcast Communications segment principal competitors
    include: Avid, Broadcast Electronics, Chyron, Evertz, Harmonic,
    Microsystems, Miranda, Nautel, NEC, Omneon, Omnibus, Pilat
    Media, Rad Systems, Rohde & Schwarz, Sony, Tektronix,
    Thomson/Grass Valley, Thomson/Thales, Vizrt and Wide Orbit, as
    well as other smaller companies and divisions of large
    companies. We believe that our broad product offering and total
    content delivery solutions are key competitive strengths for
    this segment.



In the Harris Stratex Networks segment principal competitors
    include: Alcatel-Lucent, Ceragon, Ericsson, Eltek-Nera, Fujitsu,
    NEC, Nokia-Siemens and Tadiran, as well as other smaller
    companies. Several competitors to this segment are original
    equipment manufacturers or systems integrators through which the
    segment sometimes distributes and sells products and services to
    end-users. We believe that network and systems engineering
    support and service are key competitive strengths for this
    segment.

Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to the U.S. Government, which is our only customer
    accounting for two percent or more of our total revenue, were
    66 percent of our total revenue in each of fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005. Additional information regarding customers for
    each of our segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment.”
    Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from
    contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the
    U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are
    terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as
    well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying
    goods and services to the U.S. Government are dependent on
    Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of
    funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government
    policies resulting from various military, political and
    international developments. Long-term government contracts and
    related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for
    subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under
    contracts terminable for the convenience of the
    U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive
    payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the
    proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done.
    Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that
    the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted
    and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost
    of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages.
    In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the
    complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and
    difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on
    developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under
    many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain
    facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD
    and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of
    risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see the
    discussion regarding “Government Communications
    Systems” under “Item 1. Business —
    Description of Business by Segment for the Fiscal Year Ended
    June 29, 2007” and see “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $5,871 million at July 27, 2007,
    $5,641 million at July 28, 2006 and
    $5,160 million at July 29, 2005. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $1,724 million at
    July 27, 2007, $1,482 million at July 28, 2006
    and $1,141 million at July 29, 2005. The determination
    of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with
    respect to customer requirements contracts and development and
    production contracts of a cost-reimbursement or incentive nature.

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for which
    funding has been authorized. Unfunded backlog is primarily
    unfilled firm and expected follow-on orders that have not yet
    met our established funding criteria. Our established funding
    criteria require both authorization by the customer as well as
    our management’s determination that there is little or no
    risk to the authorized funding being rescinded. In fiscal 2008,
    we expect to fill approximately 85 percent of our total
    funded backlog as of July 27, 2007. However, there can be
    no assurance that our funded backlog will become revenue in any
    particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery
    delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control.
    Additional information with regard to the backlog of each of our
    segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment for the
    Fiscal Year Ended June 29, 2007” and
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $924 million in fiscal 2007,
    $824 million in fiscal 2006 and $879 million in fiscal
    2005.

Company-sponsored research and product development costs, which
    included research and development for commercial products and
    independent research and development related to government
    products and services, were approximately $235 million in
    fiscal 2007, $198 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $146 million in fiscal 2005. A portion of our independent
    research and development costs are allocated among contracts and
    programs in process under U.S. Government contractual
    arrangements. Company-sponsored research and product development
    costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when
    incurred. The portion of total research, development and
    engineering expenditures that was not company-sponsored was
    funded by a combination of U.S. Government and commercial
    customers and is included in our revenue. Company-funded
    research is directed to the development of



new products and to building technological capability in
    selected communications and electronic systems markets.
    U.S. Government-funded research helps strengthen and
    broaden our technical capabilities. All of our segments maintain
    their own engineering and new product development departments,
    with scientific assistance provided by advanced-technology
    departments. As of June 29, 2007, we employed approximately
    6,800 engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts to
    make the technologies developed in any of our business segments
    available for all other business segments.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the
    aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large and
    valuable portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how,
    confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other
    intellectual property. We also license intellectual property to
    and from third parties. As of June 29, 2007, we held
    approximately 967 U.S. patents and 659 foreign patents, and
    had approximately 554 U.S. patent applications pending
    and 1,012 foreign patent applications pending. However, we do
    not consider our business or any business segment to be
    materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other
    intellectual property right, or any group of related patents,
    licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged
    in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a
    number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which
    generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements
    have generated income in past years and may do so in the future,
    there can be no assurances we will enter into additional
    income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage
    in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual
    property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks,
    copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive
    advantages. With regard to patents relating to our Government
    Communications Systems segment, the U.S. Government often
    has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
    pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize
    others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant
    to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to
    our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons.
    Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products
    are also considered to be a valuable asset.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic
    and international laws and regulations designed to protect the
    environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions.
    The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common
    within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve.
    We believe that we have complied with these requirements and
    that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
    Based upon currently available information, we do not expect
    expenditures to protect the environment and to comply with
    current environmental laws and regulations over the next several
    years to have a material impact on our competitive or financial
    position, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures
    will not exceed current expectations. If future laws and
    regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently
    anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present
    estimates of those expenditures. We have installed waste
    treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy
    legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and
    prevention goals. We did not spend material amounts on
    environmental capital projects in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005. A
    portion of our environmental expenditures relates to
    discontinued operations for which we have retained certain
    environmental liabilities. We currently expect that amounts to
    be spent for environmental-related capital projects will not be
    material in fiscal 2008. These amounts may increase in future
    years. Additional information regarding environmental and
    regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings” and in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

in the Notes.

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks
    segments, in particular, is subject to domestic and
    international requirements requiring end-of-life management

and/or

restricting materials in products delivered to customers,
    including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and
    Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of certain
    Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”). Such requirements are not applicable to most
    equipment produced by our Government Communications Systems and
    RF Communications segments. We believe that we have complied
    with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect
    to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend
    to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our
    future products.

Radio communications are also subject to governmental
    regulation. Equipment produced by our Broadcast Communications
    and Harris Stratex Networks segments, in particular, is subject
    to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference
    among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit
    interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that
    we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to



our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules
    and regulations with respect to our future products.
    Reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could impact our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Raw
    Materials and Supplies

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well
    as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use
    numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials (such as
    electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and
    plastics) needed for our operations and for our products. We are
    dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number
    of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers
    and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials
    restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications
    and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent upon
    one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature
    of a particular item or because of local content preference
    requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project.
    While we have been affected by financial and performance issues
    of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been
    materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw
    materials or products. In fiscal 2007, our Broadcast
    Communications segment experienced component shortages from
    vendors as a result of the new RoHS environmental regulations in
    the European Union, which became effective on July 1, 2006.
    These regulations caused a spike in demand for lead-free
    electronic components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain
    shortages.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    U.S. Government contract awards, the availability of
    funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees

As of June 29, 2007, we employed approximately
    16,000 people, compared with approximately
    13,900 employees at the end of fiscal 2006. Approximately
    89 percent of our employees are located in the United
    States. A significant number of employees in our Government
    Communications Systems segment possess a security clearance. We
    also utilize a number of independent contractors. None of our
    employees in the United States is represented by a labor union.
    In certain international subsidiaries, our employees are
    represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions.
    In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are
    good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that
    could impact our business and future results in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In
    addition, our business, operating results, cash flows and
    financial condition are subject to various risks and
    uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
    below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary
    materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.

We
    participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and
    expenditures.

We participate in markets that are subject to uncertain economic
    conditions. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level
    of growth in some of the markets in which we participate.
    Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are
    dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the
    uncertainty renders estimates of future income and expenditures
    even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant
    investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated
    benefits, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations. The future direction of the overall domestic and
    global economies also will have a significant impact on our
    overall performance.

We
    depend on the U.S. Government for a significant portion of our
    revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in U.S.
    Government funding could have adverse consequences on our future
    business.

We are highly dependent on sales to the U.S. Government.
    Approximately 66 percent of our net revenue in each of
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was derived from sales to the
    U.S. Government. Therefore, any significant disruption or
    deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government
    would significantly reduce our revenue. Our U.S. Government
    programs must compete with programs managed by other government
    contractors for limited resources and for uncertain levels of
    funding. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to
    expand their business relationships with the
    U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the
    future. The U.S. Government may choose to use other
    contractors for its limited number of programs. In addition, the
    funding of programs also competes with non-procurement spending
    of the U.S. Government. Budget decisions made by the
    U.S. Government are outside of our control and have
    long-term consequences for our business. A shift in
    U.S. Government spending to other programs in which we are
    not involved, an increase in non-procurement spending or a
    reduction in U.S. Government spending generally, could have
    material adverse consequences for our business.

We
    depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts, which
    often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be
    implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
    and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs
    is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year
    contracts may be planned or authorized in connection with major
    procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal
    year basis even though a program may continue for several years.
    Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding
    initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress
    authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding
    for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of
    anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which
    could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the
    termination of a program or the failure to commit additional
    funds to a program that already has been started could result in
    lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. In
    addition, the contracts generally contain provisions permitting
    termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the
    U.S. Government’s convenience upon the payment only
    for work done and commitments made at the time of termination.
    We can give no assurance that one or more of our
    U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under
    these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we
    would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or
    backlog lost as a result of any termination of our
    U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of
    our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under
    our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more
    large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement
    regulations and a variety of socio-economic and other
    requirements. These requirements, although customary in
    U.S. Government contracts, increase our



performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in
    the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an
    adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply
    with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension
    or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or
    subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for
    debarment are violations of various statutes, including those
    related to procurement integrity, export control,
    U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices,
    protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the
    recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a
    U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any
    of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and
    could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for
    future U.S. Government contracts.

We
    enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses
    in the event of cost overruns.

We have a number of firm fixed-price contracts. During fiscal
    2007 and 2006, approximately 33 percent and
    38 percent, respectively, of our total Government
    Communications Systems and RF Communications segments’
    revenue was from fixed-price contracts. These contracts allow us
    to benefit from cost savings, but they carry the burden of
    potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If
    our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these
    contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose us to
    potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can
    hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain
    circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by
    another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any
    cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because
    many of these contracts involve new technologies and
    applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as
    technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw
    materials, problems with other contractors and cost overruns,
    can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or
    even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not
    meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to
    renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay
    penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the
    customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of
    our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and
    audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in
    those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our
    results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize
    our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost
    overruns and cost controls would have an adverse impact on our
    financial results. Furthermore, the potential impact of this
    risk on our earnings, results of operations and financial
    results would be magnified by a shift in the mix of our
    contracts and programs toward a greater percentage of firm
    fixed-price contracts.

We
    derive a substantial portion of our revenue from international
    operations and are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the United
    States. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue from products
    exported from the U.S. or manufactured abroad was
    23 percent, 21 percent and 19 percent,
    respectively, of our total revenue. Approximately
    36 percent of our international business in fiscal 2007 was
    transacted in local currency environments. Losses resulting from
    currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We
    expect that international revenue will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant
    portion of our international revenue is in less-developed
    countries. We are subject to risks of doing business
    internationally, including:

•

Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and
    currency revaluations;

•

The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments
    relating to investments and operations, as well as
    U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
    abroad;

•

Changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
    tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade
    restrictions;

•

Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of
    funding, credit or guarantees;

•

The complexity and necessity of using foreign dealers,
    distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•

The difficulty of managing an organization doing business in
    many countries;

•

Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as
    well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;

•

Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and
    intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for
    onerous contract clauses; and

•

Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies,
    political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of
    international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.

While these factors and the impacts of these factors are
    difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations in the future.



Our
    future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products that achieve market acceptance.

Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized
    by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry
    standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a
    number of factors, including our ability to:

•

Identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;

•

Develop and maintain competitive products;

•

Enhance our products by adding innovative hardware, software or
    other features that differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors; and

•

Manufacture and bring cost-effective products to market quickly.

We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future,
    we will need to continue to develop new products, which will
    require the investment of significant financial resources in new
    product development. The need to make these expenditures could
    divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we
    cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to
    the timely development of new products. Due to the design
    complexity of some of our products, we may experience delays in
    completing development and introducing new products in the
    future. Any delays could result in increased costs of
    development or redirect resources from other projects. In
    addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our
    products will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of
    our products to gain market acceptance could significantly
    reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot
    be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products
    that gain market acceptance in advance of our products or that
    our competitors will not develop new products that cause our
    existing products to become obsolete. If we fail in our new
    product development efforts or our products fail to achieve
    market acceptance more rapidly than those of our competitors,
    our revenue will decline and our business, financial condition
    and results of operations will be adversely affected.

We
    cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events,
    but they may affect adversely the markets in which we operate,
    our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our
    profitability.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11,
    2001, the subsequent

U.S.-led

military response, current conflicts in the Middle East and the
    potential for future terrorist activities and other recent
    geo-political events have created economic and political
    uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and the prices of our securities. These matters have
    caused uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance
    markets and may increase significantly the political, economic
    and social instability in the geographic areas in which we
    operate. These matters also have caused the premiums charged for
    our insurance coverages to increase and may cause some coverages
    to be unavailable altogether. While our government businesses
    have benefited from homeland defense initiatives and the war on
    terror, these developments may affect adversely our business and
    profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we
    cannot predict at this time.

We
    have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that
    involve significant risks and uncertainties.

We have made, and we may continue to make, strategic
    acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
    These risks and uncertainties include:

•

Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and
    operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the
    risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other
    problems associated with integration;

•

Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and
    other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•

Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the
    strategic acquisitions do not prove to be those needed to be
    successful in those markets;

•

Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the
    limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the
    financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•

Potential loss of key employees of the acquired
    businesses; and

•

Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our
    existing operations.

The
    inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers
    to timely deliver our components or products, could cause our
    products to be produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory
    manner.

On many of our contracts, we engage subcontractors. In addition,
    there are certain parts or components which we source from other
    manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from time to
    time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which
    may impact their ability to supply the materials, components and
    subsystems that we require. Any inability to develop alternative
    sources of supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could
    materially impair our ability to manufacture and deliver
    products to our customers. We can give no assurances that we
    will be free from material supply problems or component or
    subsystems problems in the future. Also, our subcontractors



and other suppliers may not be able to maintain the quality of
    the materials, components and subsystems they supply, which
    might result in greater product returns and warranty claims and
    could harm our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their
    intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe
    upon our intellectual property rights.

Many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous
    protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which
    often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third
    parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future
    that we are infringing directly or indirectly their intellectual
    property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to have
    infringed directly or indirectly those intellectual property
    rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also
    require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.
    Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license
    agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be
    subject to significant damages or injunctions against
    development and sale of certain of our products. Our success
    depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on
    a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
    know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements
    to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. If we
    fail to successfully protect and enforce these rights, our
    competitive position could suffer. Our pending patent and
    trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or
    competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents
    or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not
    provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be
    required to spend significant resources to monitor and police
    our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect
    infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before
    we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our
    technology or develop competing technologies.

The
    outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is
    unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could
    have a material adverse affect on our financial position and
    results of operations.

We are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are
    involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert
    financial and management resources that would otherwise be used
    to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the
    results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An
    adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a
    material adverse affect on our financial condition.

We are
    subject to customer credit risk.

We sometimes provide medium-term and long-term customer
    financing. Customer financing arrangements may include all or a
    portion of the purchase price for our products and services, as
    well as working capital. We also may assist customers in
    obtaining financing from banks and other sources on a recourse
    or non-recourse basis. While we generally have been able to
    place a portion of our customer financings with third-party
    lenders, or to otherwise insure a portion of this risk, a
    portion of these financings is provided directly by us. There
    can be higher risks associated with some of these financings,
    particularly when provided to

start-up

operations such as local network providers, to customers in
    developing countries or to customers in specific
    financing-intensive areas of the telecommunications industry. If
    customers fail to meet their obligations, losses could be
    incurred and such losses could have an adverse effect on us. Our
    losses could be much greater if it becomes more difficult to
    place or insure against these risks with third parties. These
    risks may increase when the availability of credit decreases.

Developing
    new technologies entails significant risks and
    uncertainties.

We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products
    and services we provide. A significant portion of our business
    relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced
    defense and technology systems and products. New technologies
    associated with these systems and products may be untested or
    unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and
    products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of
    satellites, missile systems, air-traffic control systems,
    homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential
    to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. In most
    circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain
    risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate
    to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear
    substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not
    possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational
    risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an
    incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our
    insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for
    which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively
    affect our standing among our customers and the public, thereby
    making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and
    could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate
    insurance in the future.



Changes
    in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a
    number of factors including:

•

The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned
    and taxed;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax
    returns;

•

Increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including
    write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and
    impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;

•

Changes in available tax credits;

•

Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax
    laws; and

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
    tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact net income for future periods.

Our
    consolidated financial results may be impacted by Harris Stratex
    Networks’ financial results, which may vary significantly
    and be difficult to forecast.

We consolidate Harris Stratex Networks’ financial results
    in our results of operations. Harris Stratex Networks’
    financial results may vary significantly in the future and may
    be affected by a number of factors (many of which are outside of
    our and Harris Stratex Networks’ control), and accordingly
    are expected to be difficult to forecast. Delays in product
    delivery or closing of a sale can cause quarterly revenues and
    quarterly net income to fluctuate significantly from anticipated
    levels. In addition, Harris Stratex Networks may increase
    spending in response to competition or in pursuit of new market
    opportunities. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that
    Harris Stratex Networks will be able to achieve profitability in
    the future or, if profitability is attained, that Harris Stratex
    Networks will be able to sustain profitability, particularly on
    a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Because we consolidate Harris Stratex Networks’ financial
    results in our results of operations, fluctuations in and
    difficulty in forecasting Harris Stratex Networks’
    financial results will result in fluctuations in and likely
    greater difficulty in forecasting our consolidated results of
    operations. As a result, such fluctuations and forecasting
    difficulty may impact our consolidated financial results.

We
    have significant operations in Florida that could be impacted in
    the event of a hurricane and operations in California that could
    be impacted in the event of an earthquake.

Our corporate headquarters and significant operations of our
    Government Communications Systems segment are located in
    Florida. In addition, our Broadcast Communications and Harris
    Stratex Networks segments have locations near major earthquake
    fault lines in California. In the event of a major hurricane,
    earthquake or other natural disaster we could experience
    business interruptions, destruction of facilities

and/or

loss
    of life, all of which could materially adversely affect our
    business.

Changes
    in future business conditions could cause business investments
    and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in
    substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results
    of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful target analysis and due
    diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or
    strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain
    assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After
    acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely
    affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not
    recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately 35 percent of our recorded total assets. We
    evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts
    annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The
    annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring
    judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting segment
    cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate
    potential impairment of recorded goodwill. For additional
    information on accounting policies we have in place for goodwill
    impairment, see our discussion under “Critical Accounting
    Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations” and

Note 1: Significant
    Accounting Policies

in the Notes.

In
    order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm
    us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract significant
    numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding
    security clearances, to support our growth and to replace
    individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or
    for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified
    personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case in recent



years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training
    costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could
    experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our
    needs for such employees were unmet.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

We have no unresolved comments from the SEC.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our principal executive offices are located at owned facilities
    in Melbourne, Florida. As of June 29, 2007, we operated
    approximately 116 locations in the United States, Canada,
    Europe, Central and South America and Asia, consisting of about
    6.7 million square feet of manufacturing, administrative,
    research and development, warehousing, engineering and office
    space, of which approximately 4.5 million square feet are
    owned and approximately 2.2 million square feet are leased.
    There are no material encumbrances on any of our facilities. Our
    leased facilities are for the most part occupied under leases
    for remaining terms ranging from one month to 8 years, a
    majority of which can be terminated or renewed at no longer than
    five-year intervals at our option. As of June 29, 2007, the
    locations and approximate floor space of our principal offices

In the opinion of management, our facilities, whether owned or
    leased, are suitable and adequate for their intended purposes
    and have capacities adequate for current and projected needs.
    While we have some unused or under-utilized facilities, they are
    not considered significant. We continuously review our
    anticipated requirements for



facilities and will, from time to time, acquire additional
    facilities, expand existing facilities, and dispose of existing
    facilities or parts thereof, as management deems necessary. For
    more information about our lease obligations, see

Note 18: Lease Commitments

in the Notes. Our
    facilities and other properties are generally maintained in good
    operating condition.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

General.

From time to time, as a normal
    incident of the nature and kind of businesses in which we are,
    and were, engaged, various claims or charges are asserted and
    litigation commenced by or against us arising from or related
    to: product liability; personal injury; patents, trademarks,
    trade secrets or other intellectual property; labor and employee
    disputes; commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of
    products containing asbestos or other restricted materials;
    breach of warranty; or environmental matters. Claimed amounts
    against us may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable
    relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any
    real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded accruals
    for losses related to those matters against us that we consider
    to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
    contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
    legal costs are generally expensed when incurred. While it is
    not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
    certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
    disposed of or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
    information, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
    judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
    rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
    June 29, 2007 are reserved against, covered by insurance or
    would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. Government
    Business.

U.S. Government contractors, such
    as us, are engaged in supplying goods and services to the
    U.S. Government and its various agencies. We are therefore
    dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative
    allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in
    U.S. Government policies. U.S. Government contracts
    typically involve long lead times for design and development,
    are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling and
    may be unilaterally modified or cancelled by the
    U.S. Government. Often these contracts call for successful
    design and production of complex and technologically advanced
    products or systems. We may participate in supplying goods and
    services to the U.S. Government as either a prime
    contractor or as a subcontractor to a prime contractor. Disputes
    may arise between the prime contractor and the
    U.S. Government and the prime contractor and its
    subcontractors and may result in litigation between the
    contracting parties.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to
    procurement laws and regulations, including the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which outline uniform
    policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the
    U.S. Government, and specific acquisition regulations that
    implement or supplement the FAR, such as the Defense Federal
    Acquisition Regulations. As a U.S. Government contractor,
    our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continuing
    basis by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. In addition to these
    routine audits, from time to time, we may, either individually
    or in conjunction with other U.S. Government contractors,
    be the subject of audits and investigations by other agencies of
    the U.S. Government. These audits and investigations are
    conducted to determine if our performance and administration of
    our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable
    contractual requirements and procurement and other applicable
    Federal laws and regulations. These investigations may be
    conducted without our knowledge. We are unable to predict the
    outcome of such investigations or to estimate the amounts of
    resulting claims or other actions that could be instituted
    against us, our officers or employees. Under present
    U.S. Government procurement regulations, if indicted or
    adjudged in violation of procurement or other Federal laws, a
    contractor, such as us, or one or more of our operating
    divisions or subdivisions, could be subject to fines, penalties,
    repayments, or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain
    findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or
    debarment from eligibility for awards of new
    U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. Suspension
    or debarment would have a material adverse effect on us because
    of our reliance on U.S. Government contracts. In addition,
    a U.S. Government contractor’s export privileges could
    be suspended or revoked. Suspension or revocation of our export
    privileges also would have a material adverse effect on us.

International.

As an international company, we
    are, from time to time, the subject of investigations relating
    to our international operations, including under the
    U.S. export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act and similar U.S. and international laws.

Environmental.

We are subject to numerous
    Federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulatory
    requirements and are involved from time to time in
    investigations or litigation of various potential environmental
    issues concerning activities at our facilities or former
    facilities or remediation as a result of past activities
    (including past activities of companies we have acquired). From
    time to time, we receive notices from the
    U.S. Environmental



Protection Agency or equivalent state or foreign environmental
    agencies that we are a potentially responsible party under the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”)

and/or

equivalent laws. Such notices assert potential liability for
    cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us,
    sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances
    attributable to us from past operations. We own, previously
    owned or have been named as a potentially responsible party at
    16 such sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose
    no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally
    determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of
    many of these proceedings, in the opinion of our management, any
    payments we may be required to make as a result of such claims
    in existence at June 29, 2007 will not have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows. Additional information regarding environmental
    matters is set forth in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

in the Notes, which Note is incorporated herein by
    reference.

Market
    Information and Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, is listed and
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), under
    the ticker symbol “HRS.” According to the records of
    our transfer agent, as of August 22, 2007, there were
    approximately 6,748 holders of record of our common stock. On
    February 25, 2005 our Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of our common stock. The stock split was
    effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
    distributed on March 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
    March 14, 2005. All share and per share amounts and
    information presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for periods prior to the stock split have been retroactively
    restated to reflect the effect of this stock split. The high and
    low sales prices of our



common stock as reported on the NYSE composite transactions
    reporting system and the dividends paid on our common stock for
    each quarterly period in our last two fiscal years are reported

    as reported in the NYSE composite transactions reporting system
    was $59.22 per share.

Dividends

The dividends paid on our common stock for each quarter in our
    last two fiscal years are set forth in the tables above. On
    August 25, 2007, our Board of Directors increased our
    annual dividend rate from $0.44 per share to $0.60 per share and
    declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share,
    which will be paid on September 17, 2007 to holders of
    record on September 6, 2007. Our annual common stock
    dividend rate, on a post-stock split basis, was $0.44, $0.32 and
    $0.24 per share in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June,
    September and December. We have paid cash dividends every year
    since 1941, and we currently expect that cash dividends will
    continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no
    assurance. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof
    will depend on a number of factors, including our financial
    condition, capital requirements, results of operations, future
    business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors
    may deem relevant.

    fiscal 2006, we repurchased 1,050,000 shares of our common
    stock at an average price per share of $42.71. The level of our
    repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our
    financial condition, capital requirements, results of
    operations, future business prospects and other factors that our
    Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, volume and
    nature of share repurchases are subject to market conditions,
    applicable securities laws and other factors and are at the
    discretion of management and may be suspended or discontinued at
    any time. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.

BUSINESS
    CONSIDERATIONS

General

We are an international communications and information
    technology company serving government and commercial markets in
    more than 150 countries. We are focused on developing

best-in-class

assured
    communications

tm

products, systems and services for global markets. Our four
    segments serve markets for government communications, RF
    communications, broadcast communications and wireless
    transmission network solutions. Our company generates revenue,
    income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing and selling
    communications products and software as well as providing
    related services. We generally sell directly to our customers,
    the largest of which is the U.S. Government and its prime
    contractors. We also utilize agents and intermediaries to sell
    some products and services, especially in international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the markets we
    serve and for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, operated
    in the following four business segments: (1) Government
    Communications Systems, (2) RF Communications,
    (3) Broadcast Communications, and (4) Harris Stratex
    Networks (formerly Microwave



Communications). As described in greater detail in “Item 1.
    Business — Recent Acquisitions and Business
    Combinations” in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we combined our former
    Microwave Communications Division with Stratex, a
    publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless transmission
    systems, to form a new company named Harris Stratex Networks. We
    own approximately 57 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock and the minority stockholders
    own approximately 43 percent of Harris Stratex
    Networks’ outstanding stock. Following that combination,
    our business segment formerly referred to as Microwave
    Communications is now referred to as Harris Stratex Networks.
    The results of the Harris Stratex Networks segment reflect the
    results of the combined business for periods following the
    combination. Financial information with respect to all of our
    other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    business segments, is reported as part of Headquarters Expense
    or Non-Operating Income (Loss).

On May 21, 2007, we announced that effective for fiscal
    2008 (which began June 30, 2007), our segment reporting
    would be adjusted to reflect our new organizational structure.
    For fiscal 2008, our Department of Defense Programs area, part
    of our Government Communications Systems segment for fiscal
    2007, will be combined with our RF Communications business and
    reported as our Defense Communications and Electronics segment.
    As a result, our segment reporting for fiscal 2008 will consist
    of the following four business segments: (1) Government
    Communications Systems, (2) Defense Communications and
    Electronics, (3) Broadcast Communications, and
    (4) Harris Stratex Networks. Our Broadcast Communications
    and Harris Stratex Networks segments will not change as a result
    of the adjustments to our organizational structure. These
    adjustments to our segment reporting take effect in fiscal 2008
    and therefore do not affect the historical results, discussion
    or presentation of our business segments as set forth in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We will begin to report our financial results consistent with
    this new segment reporting structure beginning with the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008.

Harris’ mission statement is as follows: “Harris
    Corporation will be the

best-in-class

global provider of mission-critical assured communications
    systems and services to both government and commercial
    customers, combining advanced technology and application
    knowledge.”

Value
    Drivers of Our Businesses and Our Strategy for Achieving
    Value

We are committed to our mission statement, and we believe that
    executing our mission statement creates value. Consistent with
    this commitment to effective execution, we currently focus on
    these key value drivers:

•

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all segments;

•

Focusing on operating efficiencies and cost reductions;

•

Leveraging various corporate initiatives across business
    segments;

•

Making strategic acquisitions to enhance and supplement our
    products and services portfolio and gain access to new
    markets; and

•

Maintaining an efficient capital structure.

Continuing profitable revenue growth in all
    segments:

We plan to focus on continued
    profitable growth by implementing the following strategies in
    each segment:

Government Communications Systems:

Build on
    successes in core markets such as avionics, electronics and data
    links; space and ground SATCOM systems including antennas and
    space-hardened electronics; communications and information
    networks; database and image processing; wireless products;
    intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and mission
    operations and services. Continue emphasis on customer and
    program diversification to balance portfolio risk. Leverage
    capabilities in communications and information technology needs
    into new Federal agencies.

RF Communications:

Continue to leverage
    reputation and position as a leading provider of tactical radios
    in the areas of high-frequency (“HF”), multiband and
    cryptographic sub-systems; and expand market reach with new
    products such as the
    Falcon

®

III JTRS-compliant multiband handheld, manpack and vehicular and
    personal role radios as well as high-capacity line-of-site
    radios, COMSEC terminals, unmanned ground sensor products and
    international systems.

Broadcast Communications:

Offer the global
    media market a broad portfolio of hardware and software
    solutions to support every segment of the supply chain that
    brings digital audio, video and data to consumers; and continue
    to fund a robust offering of new products for the three product
    areas of video distribution & digital media,
    transmission systems and software solutions.

Harris Stratex Networks:

Continue to win
    opportunities with public telecommunications providers as well
    as Federal, state and other private network operators to meet
    increasing demand for capacity requirements and the demand for
    high-reliability, high-bandwidth networks that are more secure
    and better protected against natural and man-made disasters.
    Offer innovative new products and expanding regional sales
    channels to capture greenfield network opportunities and
    penetrate major regional mobile telecom operators to participate
    in network opportunities.



Offer a broad range of engineering and other professional
    services for network planning, systems architecture design and
    project management as a global competitive advantage. Expand our
    network operations offerings in microwave and non-microwave
    opportunities to create items that differentiate our total
    solutions offerings.

Focusing on operating efficiencies and cost
    reductions:

Our principal focus areas for
    operating efficiencies and cost management are: reducing
    procurement costs through an emphasis on coordinated supply
    chain management; reducing product costs through dedicated
    engineering resources focused on product design; improving
    manufacturing efficiencies across all segments; and optimizing
    facility utilization.

Leveraging various corporate initiatives across business
    segments:

One of our strengths is our ability
    to transfer technology among segments and focus our research and
    development projects in ways that benefit Harris as a whole.
    Another area of focus is cross-selling through segment sales
    channels and joint pursuits by multiple segments. Other
    corporate initiatives include joint international market channel
    development, such as shared distributors and coordinated
    “go-to-market” strategies.

Making strategic acquisitions:

Another
    key value driver is effective capital allocation by making
    effective acquisitions and investments to build or complement
    the strengths in our base businesses. We believe acquisitions
    may also serve to balance and enhance our portfolio of
    businesses. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we combined our
    Microwave Communications Division with Stratex to
    form Harris Stratex Networks, the largest independent
    provider of wireless transmission network solutions, of which we
    own 57 percent. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we
    acquired Multimax, a leading provider of information technology
    and network services for the U.S. Government, which is
    being operated as part of our Government Communications Systems
    segment. The acquisition of Multimax will provide greater scale,
    a broader customer base and new growth opportunities through key
    positions on GWACs. In recent years, we have also made several
    acquisitions in our Broadcast Communications segment including
    Encoda, Leitch, OSi and Aastra Digital Video. These acquisitions
    helped us expand our product and service portfolio so we can
    offer end-to-end content delivery, transport and asset
    management solutions to our customers.

Maintaining an efficient capital
    structure:

Our capital structure is intended
    to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital
    position, access to key financial markets, ability to raise
    funds at a low effective cost and overall low cost of borrowing
    provide a competitive advantage. We had $388.7 million in
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of
    June 29, 2007 and had $438.6 million of cash flows
    provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007. Our cash is
    not restricted and can be used to invest in capital
    expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our common
    stock or pay dividends to our shareholders. During fiscal 2007,
    our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program
    authorizing the repurchase of up to $600 million of our
    stock. While this program does not have a stated expiration
    date, we repurchased $200 million of shares during fiscal
    2007 under this program and management expects to repurchase the
    remaining $400 million of shares over the following eight
    quarters.

Key
    Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our
    key indicators of value such as: (1) net income and net
    income per diluted share, (2) revenue, (3) gross
    margin, (4) net income as a percentage of revenue,
    (5) operating cash flows, (6) return on average assets
    and (7) return on average equity. The measure of our
    success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity
    and capital resources key indicators:

Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations Key
    Indicators:

Net income, net income per
    diluted share, revenue, gross margin, and net income as a
    percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value
    drivers:

•

Net income increased 101.9 percent from $237.9 million
    in fiscal 2006 to $480.4 million in fiscal 2007, which
    includes a $143.1 million after-tax gain on the combination
    with Stratex;

•

Net income per diluted share increased 100.6 percent from
    $1.71 in fiscal 2006 to $3.43 in fiscal 2007;

•

Revenue increased 22.1 percent from $3.5 billion in
    fiscal 2006 to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2007;

•

Gross margin (revenue from product sales and services less cost
    of product sales and services) increased from 31.3 percent
    of revenue in fiscal 2006 to 32.3 percent of revenue in
    fiscal 2007; and

•

Net income as a percentage of revenue increased from
    6.8 percent in fiscal 2006 to 11.3 percent in fiscal
    2007.

Refer to MD&A heading “Operations Review” below
    for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Key
    Indicators:

Net cash provided by operating
    activities, return on average assets and return on average
    equity also represent key measurements of our value drivers.



•

Our net cash provided by operating activities increased from
    $334.2 million in fiscal 2006 to $438.6 million in
    fiscal 2007.

•

We expect to generate between $550 million and
    $600 million of net cash from operating activities in
    fiscal 2008.

•

Return on average assets (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of total assets at the beginning and ending of
    the fiscal year) increased from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2006
    to 12.7 percent in fiscal 2007.

•

Return on average equity (defined as net income divided by the
    two-point average of shareholders’ equity at the beginning
    and ending of the fiscal year) increased from 15.3 percent
    in fiscal 2006 to 26.9 percent in fiscal 2007.

Refer to MD&A heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources
    and Financial Strategies” below for more information.

Industry-Wide
    Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Defense Markets:

The U.S.
    President’s budget proposal for the U.S. Government fiscal
    years 2008 to 2012 focuses on achieving a balanced budget while
    addressing the nation’s most critical needs and the
    continuing trend by Federal agencies to reduce costs by
    outsourcing IT and communications related operations. The
    Administration’s priorities include a continued and
    accelerated commitment to modernizing the military to focus more
    on the needs of its combat commanders and to develop portfolios
    of joint capabilities. As a result, the U.S. Government
    remains committed to funding intelligence, information
    superiority, special operations and support. Requirements to
    upgrade and modernize tactical radio communications capabilities
    and provide more secure, interoperable and reliable
    communications remain a funding priority. International defense
    forces continue to drive toward tactical communications upgrades
    and interoperability with the systems and equipment used by the
    U.S. Government.

The $481.4 billion DoD U.S. Government Fiscal Year
    (“GFY”) 2008 budget request is approximately
    11 percent above GFY 2007 levels. This excludes emergency
    supplemental funding. However, the President’s budget has
    proposed a war-related funding request of $141.7 billion.
    While the DoD’s budget increase can be a positive indicator
    of growth for the defense industry, we believe that the level of
    growth and amount of budget ultimately allocated to DoD
    procurement (“Procurement”), along with research,
    development, test and evaluation (“RDT&E”)
    components of the DoD budget, are a better indicator of DoD
    spending. These accounts are applicable to defense contractors
    because they generally represent the amounts that are expended
    for military hardware and technology. We also believe that the
    federal budget deficit is putting pressure on spending in all
    agencies and the number of large new program starts has slowed.

While there is no assurance that the requested DoD budget
    increases will continue to be approved by Congress, the current
    outlook is one of increased DoD spending, which we believe will
    continue to positively affect our future orders, sales, income
    and cash flows. Conversely, a decline in the DoD budget would
    generally have a negative effect on future orders, sales, income
    and cash flows of defense contractors, including us, depending
    on the weapons platforms and programs affected by such budget
    reductions.

Government Markets Other Than
    Defense:

A funding priority for the
    U.S. Government is the security of the U.S., which includes
    better communications interplay between law enforcement, civil
    government agencies, intelligence agencies and our military
    services. Funding for investments in secure tactical
    communications, information technology, information processing
    and additional communications assets and upgrades remains solid.
    Another priority of the U.S. Government is investments in
    productivity, cost reductions and outsourcing. As a result,
    programs that promote these initiatives are also expected to
    receive funding. We provide products and services to a number of
    U.S. Government agencies including the FAA, NRO, NGA,
    Census Bureau, Department of State, NSA, NOAA and others. Recent
    trends continue to indicate an increase in demand from these
    agencies to outsource their requirement for better, more
    efficient and less costly information technology and
    communications.

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to
    U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may
    investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with
    applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of
    those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could
    make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement
    regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a
    government contractor could result in that contractor being
    fined

and/or

suspended from being able to bid on, or being awarded, new
    U.S. Government contracts for a period of time. Similar
    government oversight exists in most other countries where we
    conduct business. We are currently not aware of any compliance
    audits or investigations that could result in a significant
    impact to our financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

While recent developments in the government and defense industry
    have had a positive impact on our Government Communications
    Systems and RF Communications segments, we remain subject to
    other risks



associated with U.S. Government business, including
    technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations
    and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks,
    which are discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
    and under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Commercial Broadcast Communications and Microwave
    Communications Markets:

Global economic
    growth rates continue at modest levels in the broadcast and
    microwave markets.

Global trends and developments in the broadcast communications
    market include:

•

Transitioning from analog to digital media and HD content
    continues to reshape the broadcast and other media markets and
    drive demand;

•

Continuing consolidation in broadcast and other media operators
    is creating larger enterprises seeking suppliers with a broad
    portfolio of hardware and software solutions to support all
    aspects of their operations;

•

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has
    mandated a DTV roll-out. Congressional legislation requires the
    return of all analog frequencies from the broadcasters by
    February 17, 2009. The returned analog spectrum will be
    available for auction by the FCC for new commercial uses,
    industry, media and mobile telecom services;

•

Domestic radio broadcasters are taking steps to transition from
    analog to digital technology. There are approximately 13,500
    radio stations in the United States; and

•

The worldwide transition to digital technologies is in various
    stages of implementation. Many international markets remain
    primarily analog replacement markets.

Global trends and developments in the microwave communications
    market include:

•

Continuing build-out of new networks in emerging markets to meet
    rapid subscriber growth;

•

Increasing demand for microwave communications due to build-outs
    for third-generation (“3G”) services rapidly
    increasing the number of cell sites;

•

Increasing demand to support capacity needs for new triple-play
    services;

•

Continuing fixed-line to mobile-line substitution;

•

Private networks and public telecommunications operators
    building high-reliability, high-bandwidth data networks that are
    more secure and better protected against natural and man-made
    disasters;

•

Continuing global mobile operator consolidation; and

•

The FCC mandated a 2 GHz relocation project designed to
    resolve a public safety interference problem. The project
    includes the relocation of 12 federal agencies and a significant
    amount of microwave radio content. The FCC has mandated that
    most television broadcasters, fixed-link service users and
    others who operate within the 1990 — 2110 MHz
    spectrum band replace

and/or

upgrade their 2 GHz transmission facilities by
    September 7, 2007 to operate within the 2025 —
    2110 MHz spectrum band. In exchange, the FCC will
    relinquish spectrum at 700 and 800 MHz and pay television
    broadcasters cash.

Our management believes that our experience and capabilities are
    well aligned with, and that we are positioned to capitalize on,
    the market trends noted above. While we believe that these
    developments generally will have a positive impact on us, we
    remain subject to general economic conditions that could
    adversely affect our customers. We also remain subject to other
    risks associated with these markets, including technological
    uncertainties, changes in the FCC’s regulations, slow
    market adoption of digital radio and DTV or any of our new
    products and other risks which are discussed under
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect
    Future Results” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors”

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our revenue for fiscal 2007 was
    $4,243.0 million, an increase of 22.1 percent compared
    to fiscal 2006. Net income for fiscal 2007 was
    $480.4 million, an increase of 101.9 percent



compared to fiscal 2006 net income of $237.9 million.
    Fiscal 2007 revenue increased in all four of our business
    segments and was led by the increase in our RF Communications
    segment, which increased 45.8 percent and our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment, which increased 45.7 percent. Our
    Harris Stratex Networks segment’s fiscal 2007 revenue
    increase was primarily due to the impact of the combination of
    our former Microwave Communications segment with Stratex in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2007.

The increase in net income was led by a $166.5 million
    increase in operating income in our Harris Stratex Networks
    segment as a result of the combination with Stratex, including a
    $163.4 million gain ($143.1 million after-tax) as a
    result of the transaction, partially offset by
    $46.0 million of transaction-related and integration costs.
    Our RF Communications segment also had significant improvement
    in operating income with a 44.6 percent increase over
    fiscal 2006. Our Broadcast Communications segment operating
    income was adversely impacted by $7.5 million of costs
    associated with cost-reduction actions in fiscal 2007 and the
    impact of an $18.9 million write-down of capitalized
    software associated with management’s decision to
    discontinue an automation software development effort.
    Headquarters expense decreased in fiscal 2007 to
    $69.6 million compared to $75.4 million in fiscal
    2006, primarily due to a $5.4 million charge related to our
    arbitration with Bourdex in fiscal 2006.

Net interest expense increased slightly from $24.7 million
    in fiscal 2006 to $27.6 million in fiscal 2007 mainly due
    to a full year impact of our September 2005 issuance of
    $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due 2015. Our non-operating loss increased to $16.2 million
    in fiscal 2007, compared to $1.2 million in fiscal 2006,
    and included a $19.8 million write-down of our investment
    in Terion due to an other-than-temporary impairment. Our income
    taxes as a percentage of income before taxes and minority
    interest decreased from 37.5 percent in fiscal 2006 to
    28.9 percent in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the tax free
    nature of the combination with Stratex and a favorable
    settlement that was approved by the United States Joint
    Committee on Taxation and related matters between us and the
    Internal Revenue Service concerning the tax audit for fiscal
    years 2001, 2002 and 2003. See the “Discussion of Business
    Segments” discussion below of this MD&A for further
    information.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Our revenue for fiscal 2006 was
    $3,474.8 million, an increase of 15.8 percent compared
    to fiscal 2005. Net income for fiscal 2006 was
    $237.9 million, an increase of 17.7 percent compared
    to fiscal 2005 net income of $202.2 million. Revenue
    increased in all four of our business segments and was led by
    the increase in our RF Communications segment, which increased
    50.5 percent. Our Broadcast Communications segment’s
    revenue increase was primarily due to the impact of the Leitch
    acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and the Encoda
    acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

Operating income in our RF Communications, Government
    Communications Systems and Broadcast Communications segments
    improved in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Our RF
    Communications segment led this improvement with a
    67.5 percent increase. Our Harris Stratex Networks segment
    had a $19.6 million operating loss in fiscal 2006 that
    included the impact of $39.6 million in charges associated
    with product discontinuances and a shutdown of manufacturing
    activities in Montreal, Canada. Our Broadcast Communications
    segment operating income was adversely impacted by a
    $25.0 million charge related to cost-reduction actions in
    fiscal 2006 and the impact of $11.9 million of charges
    related to our Leitch acquisition. Headquarters expense
    increased in fiscal 2006 and included the impact of a
    $5.4 million charge associated with a decision we received
    in our arbitration with Bourdex.

Net interest expense increased in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005
    due to our September 2005 issuance of $300 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes due 2015. We had a
    non-operating loss of $1.2 million in fiscal 2006, compared
    to $6.3 million in fiscal 2005. Our income taxes as a
    percentage of income before taxes increased from
    32.2 percent in fiscal 2005 to 37.5 percent in fiscal
    2006, primarily due to a portion of the charges mentioned above
    being recorded in foreign jurisdictions where we had significant
    net operating losses and realization of the associated tax
    benefits was considered uncertain. See the “Discussion of
    Business Segments” portion below of this MD&A for
    further information.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    32.3 percent in fiscal 2007 compared to 31.3 percent
    in fiscal 2006. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased
    in our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex Networks
    segments and decreased slightly in our Government Communications
    Systems segment. The overall blended fiscal 2007 gross
    margin was positively impacted by a larger mix of sales coming
    from our higher-margin RF Communications segment’s products
    in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and the impact of the
    Leitch, Aastra Digital Video and OSi acquisitions in fiscal 2006
    in our Broadcast Communications segment. Gross margins decreased
    in our Government Communications Systems segment as a result of
    schedule and cost overruns on a commercial satellite antenna
    program absorbed during the year. Gross margins in our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment were adversely impacted in fiscal 2006
    by $35.0 million of inventory write-downs and other charges
    associated with product discontinuances and the shut down of
    manufacturing activities in our Montreal, Canada plant. Gross
    margins in our Harris Stratex Networks segment were impacted in
    fiscal 2007 by $8.7 million of lower margins being
    recognized subsequent to our combination with Stratex due to a
    step up in inventory and fixed assets recorded as of the
    combination date. The gross margin in our Broadcast
    Communications segment was adversely impacted in fiscal 2006 by
    $11.3 million of inventory write-downs associated with
    cost-reduction actions, including the transfer of European
    manufacturing operations to the United States and outsourcing of
    other manufacturing activity and $2.7 million of lower
    margins being recognized subsequent to our acquisition of Leitch
    due to a step up in inventory recorded as of the acquisition
    date. See the “Discussion of Business Segments”
    discussion below of this MD&A for further information.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Our gross margin (revenue less cost of
    product sales and services) as a percentage of revenue was
    31.3 percent in fiscal 2006 compared to 27.3 percent
    in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 gross margin as a percent of
    revenue increased in our Broadcast Communications, Government
    Communications Systems and RF Communications segments and
    decreased in our Harris Stratex Networks segment. The fiscal
    2006 gross margin was also positively impacted by a larger
    mix of sales coming from our higher-margin RF Communications
    segment’s products in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.
    Gross margins decreased in our Harris Stratex Networks segment
    due to $35.0 million of inventory write-downs and other
    charges associated with product discontinuances and the shutdown
    of manufacturing activities in our Montreal, Canada plant. The
    gross margin increase in our Broadcast Communications segment
    included the impact of our Leitch and Encoda acquisitions, which
    had higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue than many of
    our other operations. The gross margin in our Broadcast
    Communications segment was adversely impacted by
    $11.3 million of inventory write-downs associated with
    previously announced cost-reduction actions, including the
    transfer of European manufacturing operations to the United
    States and outsourcing of other manufacturing activity and
    $2.7 million of lower margins being recognized subsequent
    to our acquisition of Leitch due to a step up in inventory
    recorded as of the acquisition date. See the “Discussion of

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased from $682.3 million in
    fiscal 2006 to $830.7 million in fiscal 2007. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses remained consistent at
    19.6 percent in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The increase
    in our engineering, selling and administrative expenses in whole
    dollars is primarily related to the following in fiscal 2007:
    increased research and development costs associated with our RF
    Communications segment’s
    Falcon

®

III radio development; our combination with Stratex including
    $37.3 million of transaction-related and integration costs;
    and $26.4 million of costs incurred related to the
    write-down of capitalized software and cost-reduction actions
    taken in our Broadcast Communications segment. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below of
    this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $234.6 million in fiscal
    2007, compared to $197.8 million in fiscal 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to increased spending on the
    development of our
    Falcon

III radio in our RF Communications segment and the full year
    impact of our acquisition of Leitch.



Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Our engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased from $497.8 million in
    fiscal 2005 to $682.3 million in fiscal 2006. As a
    percentage of revenue, these expenses increased from
    16.6 percent in fiscal 2005 to 19.6 percent in fiscal
    2006. The increase in our engineering, selling, and
    administrative expenses in whole dollars, as well as a
    percentage of revenue, was primarily related to increased
    research and development costs associated with our RF
    Communications segment’s
    Falcon

®

III radio development, our acquisitions of Leitch and Encoda,
    $13.7 million of charges related to cost-reduction actions
    in our Broadcast Communications segment and a $5.4 million
    charge in headquarters expense related to our arbitration with
    Bourdex. The Leitch and Encoda businesses typically have higher
    engineering, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of revenue than other Harris businesses. See the
    “Discussion of Business Segments” discussion below of
    this MD&A for further information.

Overall company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which are included in engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses, were $197.8 million in fiscal

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Our provision for income taxes as a
    percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest
    decreased from 37.5 percent in fiscal 2006 to
    28.9 percent in fiscal 2007. The decrease in our effective
    tax rate in fiscal 2007 resulted from several items. During
    fiscal 2007, the United States Joint Committee on Taxation
    approved a favorable settlement between us and the Internal
    Revenue Service concerning the tax audit for fiscal years 2001,
    2002 and 2003. The settlement, together with related matters,
    reduced tax expense in an aggregate amount of $12 million.
    The remaining decrease in the provision for income taxes was
    primarily due to the tax free nature of the combination with
    Stratex, which resulted in a $163.4 million pre-tax gain
    ($143.1 million after-tax), partially offset by
    transaction-related costs incurred in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment and cost-reduction initiatives in our Broadcast
    Communications segment in foreign jurisdictions where we have
    significant net operating losses and where we were unable to
    recognize a tax benefit associated with these charges due to
    uncertainty about their realization. See

Note 22: Income
    Taxes

in the Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Our provision for income taxes as a
    percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest
    increased from 32.2 percent in fiscal 2005 to
    37.5 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in the rate was
    primarily attributable to charges associated with inventory
    write-downs in our Harris Stratex Networks segment,
    cost-reduction actions in our Broadcast Communications segment
    and a charge from our arbitration with Bourdex being recorded in
    foreign jurisdictions, where realization of the associated tax
    benefits was considered uncertain because we had significant
    operating losses in those jurisdictions. The remaining increase
    in the rate was mainly driven by the increase in our earnings
    and the fixed nature of tax credits and other benefits we
    received in both years related to export sales and a
    $3.5 million reduction in taxes in fiscal 2005 from the
    resolution of certain tax issues, for which liabilities had
    previously been established.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 10.2 percent and operating income
    increased 4.2 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The
    increase in revenue primarily came from the FDCA program for the
    U.S. Census Bureau, the FTI program for the FAA, the
    Patriot technical services program for the NRO, several new
    programs from our national intelligence customers, the CDL
    Hawklink program for the U.S. Navy, the MIDS terminals
    program for the DoD, aircraft avionics for the F-22A aircraft
    and the acquisition of Multimax on June 15, 2007.
    Significant programs in fiscal 2007 included FTI, Patriot, FDCA,
    MCOM,

F/A-18E/F,

MTAIP, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, OSSS, State 6 program for the
    U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs and
    various classified programs.

Total funded and unfunded backlog was approximately
    $4.637 billion and $4.572 billion at June 29,
    2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively. These amounts
    included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which
    funding has been authorized) and unfunded backlog (primarily
    unfilled firm and expected follow-on orders that have not yet
    met our established funding criteria). Our established funding
    criteria require both authorization by the customer as well as
    our management’s determination that there is little or no
    risk to the authorized funding being rescinded. Funded backlog
    was approximately $372 million at June 29, 2007
    compared to $400 million at June 30, 2006.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
    increased during fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to favorable program mix offset by schedule and
    cost overruns on a satellite antenna



program absorbed during fiscal 2007. Engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses in this segment decreased in fiscal 2007
    when compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a gain recorded on
    the sale of our STAT network security product line.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our
    acquisition of Multimax, a leading provider of information
    technology and network services for the U.S. Government.
    With this acquisition, we have nearly doubled our IT services
    revenue, added a number of new customers across the DoD and
    civilian agencies, and gained positions on long-term government
    IT services contracts. For further information related to the
    acquisition of Multimax, including the allocation of the
    purchase price and pro forma results as if the acquisition of
    Multimax had taken place as of the beginning of the periods
    presented, see

Note 3: Business Combinations

in the
    Notes.

The following major contract awards and highlights occurred
    during fiscal 2007 in our Government Communications Systems
    segment:

•

$44 million, three-year contract from Mobile Satellite
    Ventures to provide commercial space antenna systems. This order
    was strategically important to us and is expected to assist us
    to further penetrate the commercial space market.

•

$42 million, follow-on contract on our State 6 program that
    provides information technology architecture technical services
    to the Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs.

•

$36 million, four-year contract with the Government
    Printing Office to develop a digital information system that
    will allow the public to access Federal documents from all three
    branches of the Federal government and the Federal Depository
    Library Program.

•

$66 million, three-year contract for pre-production and
    testing of the Hawklink Common Data Link system for the
    Navy’s LAMPS helicopters. Potential value of the Hawklink
    production program could exceed $350 million by 2015.

•

    additional hardware for integration into the MIDS terminals that
    provide U.S. military forces with secure, jam-resistant
    digital tactical communications. This follow-on award brings the
    overall potential value of this contract to $140 million.

•

$30 million, follow-on contract with the Air Force to
    provide fiber optic network components for the Air Force’s
    premier air superiority fighter.

•

Several classified programs.

During fiscal 2007 this segment derived 95 percent of its
    revenue from the U.S. Government including 15 percent
    from the FAA.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Government Communications Systems
    segment revenue increased 0.4 percent and operating income
    increased 6.4 percent from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The
    increase in revenue primarily came from the FTI program for the
    FAA, the Patriot technical services program for the NRO, the
    RADIC program for the NSA and increased sales of commercial
    satellite antenna products, partially offset by spending
    constraints on our national intelligence customers. Also, fiscal
    2005 benefited from $79 million in revenue from the Iraqi
    Media Network program, which was completed in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2005. Significant programs in fiscal 2006 included
    FTI, Patriot, MCOM, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, OSSS, State 6
    program for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of
    Consular Affairs to modernize its information technology
    architecture, the U.S. Air Force’s family of Beyond
    Line-of-Sight program,

F/A-18E/F,

MTAIP and various classified programs.

Total funded and unfunded backlog was approximately
    $4.572 billion and $4.401 billion at June 30,
    2006 and July 1, 2005, respectively. These amounts included
    both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has
    been authorized) and unfunded backlog (primarily unfilled firm
    and expected follow-on orders that have not yet met our
    established funding criteria). Our established funding criteria
    require both authorization by the customer as well as our
    management’s determination that there is little or no risk
    to the authorized funding being rescinded. Funded backlog was
    approximately $400 million at June 30, 2006 compared
    to $395 million at July 2, 2005.

Government Communications Systems segment operating income
    improved during fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005,
    primarily due to strong program execution and a higher mix of
    fixed-price production programs and favorable program closeouts,
    which was partially offset by investments made for programs such
    as FTI and Patriot that were in their early phases. Engineering,
    selling and administrative expenses in this segment increased in
    fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 due to increased
    investment in supply chain-related initiatives and the impact of
    expensing stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“Statement 123R”).



The following major contract awards and highlights occurred
    during fiscal 2006 in our Government Communications Systems
    segment:

•

$600 million, five-year contract with the U.S. Census
    Bureau for its Field Data Collection Automation program. We will
    integrate multiple automated systems required to obtain data
    from field census-takers during the 2010 Census.

•

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 45.8 percent and operating income increased
    44.6 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Strong
    revenue growth continued in both U.S. and international
    markets fueled by on-going tactical radio modernization
    programs. Demand for our
    Falcon

®

II and
    Falcon

®

III tactical radios continued to be driven by their advanced
    features and strong performance in the field.

We have now delivered over 17,000 units of our
    next-generation
    Falcon

®

III multi-band handheld radio since its launch in fiscal 2006.
    The
    Falcon

®

III handheld radio is the first widely-fielded tactical radio to
    receive certification from the Joint Tactical Radio System Joint
    Program Executive Office (“JTRS JPEO”) and the NSA.
    Customers for the
    Falcon

®

III handheld and vehicular radio systems include the
    U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, as well
    as other government agencies. The
    Falcon

®

III has been well received by the market and is providing true
    multi-mode operational capabilities, including ground-to-ground,
    ground-to-air and long-range tactical satellite communications.
    The
    Falcon

®

III multiband manpack radio, scheduled for release in September
    2007, will be the first NSA-certified radio to provide wideband
    secure networking for data-intensive applications, such as video
    transmission in mobile battlefield conditions.

The fiscal 2007 operating income increase in our RF
    Communications segment was driven primarily by higher sales
    volume partially offset by a decline in gross margin as a
    percent of sales as a result of increased sales of our
    Falcon

®

III handheld radio units which have lower margins. As a
    percentage of sales, engineering, selling and administrative
    expense decreased from fiscal 2006 to 2007 in our RF
    Communications segment primarily due to the 45.8 percent
    increase in revenue. This segment continued, however, to invest
    in research and development costs associated with the
    development of our
    Falcon

®

III product family. To continue to meet strong demand across all
    product lines in this segment, in fiscal 2007 we significantly
    expanded our radio manufacturing capacity.

Orders for fiscal 2007 were $1.3 billion for this segment.
    Significant orders secured during fiscal 2007 included:

•

An IDIQ contract with a maximum value of $422 million from
    the U.S. Army for Falcon II HF manpack radios and
    related vehicular base station systems. We received an initial
    $104 million order under this contract.



•

An IDIQ contract by the JTRS JPEO to supply the DoD with
    next-generation Falcon III multiband handheld radios and
    vehicular systems. This contract has a one-year maximum value of
    $2.7 billion and a five-year maximum value of
    $7 billion. Under the contract, orders will be awarded
    based on competitive bidding between us and the incumbent
    supplier.

    Nigeria.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

RF Communications segment revenue
    increased 50.5 percent and operating income increased
    67.5 percent from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Strong
    revenue growth came from both U.S. and international
    markets and was primarily driven by force modernization, force
    restructuring initiatives moving communications closer to
    individual soldiers, and the worldwide need for interoperable
    communications. This demand led to increased sales of our
    Falcon

®

II family of products and the successful introduction of our new
    Falcon

®

III product family.

The operating income improvement in our RF Communications
    segment was driven primarily by improved gross margin on higher
    sales volume as manufacturing efficiencies were realized.
    Engineering, selling and administrative expenses increased in
    our RF Communications segment during fiscal 2006 when compared
    to fiscal 2005 due to additional research and development costs
    associated with the development of our
    Falcon

®

III product family and expenses needed to market and sell new
    products. To continue to meet strong demand across all product
    lines in this segment, we significantly expanded our radio
    manufacturing capacity.

Orders for fiscal 2006 were above $1.0 billion for this
    segment. Significant orders secured during fiscal 2006 included:

•

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Harris Stratex Networks segment revenue
    increased 45.7 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007.
    Organic revenue growth (calculated on a pro forma basis as if
    the former Microwave Communications Division and Stratex had
    been combined since the beginning of fiscal 2006) in fiscal 2007
    was 11 percent when compared to fiscal 2006. This segment
    had an operating income of $146.9 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to an operating loss of $19.6 million in fiscal
    2006.

On January 26, 2007 our Microwave Communications segment
    was combined with Stratex to create Harris Stratex Networks,
    with us owning 57 percent of the outstanding shares. Our
    fiscal 2007 financial results include five months of Harris
    Stratex Networks on a fully consolidated basis, with an
    elimination of the minority interest.

North America microwave revenue increased by $48 million or
    28 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Revenue for
    fiscal 2007 included $8 million of revenue related to the
    combination with Stratex. The remainder of the increase in North
    America microwave was primarily due to increased demand for our
    products driven by mobile operators that are upgrading and
    expanding networks for high bandwidth voice, data and video
    services and by private networks upgrading for increased
    reliability, survivability and interoperability. International
    microwave revenue increased by $109 million or
    67 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Revenue in
    fiscal 2007 included



$116 million of revenue related to the combination with
    Stratex. This increase in international microwave revenue from
    the combination with Stratex was partially offset by lower
    revenue due to the timing of project awards.

We recorded a $163.4 million pre-tax gain on the
    transaction which relates to the deemed sale for accounting
    purposes of 43 percent of the assets and liabilities of our
    former Microwave Communications business to the minority
    shareholders of Harris Stratex Networks. Additionally, we
    incurred $28.8 million of transaction-related costs such as
    the write-off of in-process research and development and the
    impact of a step up in inventory and fixed assets and
    $17.2 million of integration costs. For further information
    related to the combination with Stratex, including the
    allocation of the purchase price and pro forma results as if the
    combination with Stratex had taken place as of the beginning of
    the periods presented, see

Note 3: Business Combinations

and

Note 4: Ownership in Harris Stratex Networks

in the Notes.

These gains and charges were partially offset by income
    generated from the operations acquired from Stratex, and by the
    increased gross margin generated by the increased revenues from
    our North America microwave business.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Harris Stratex Networks segment
    (formerly our Microwave Communications segment) revenue
    increased 8.9 percent from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. This
    segment had an operating loss of $19.6 million in fiscal
    2006 compared to operating income of $7.7 million in fiscal
    2005. The success of this segment’s
    TRuepoint

tm

radio products and a strengthening market for microwave radios
    primarily drove the increase in revenue. International order
    rates increased, particularly in Africa. In North America,
    microwave demand for both private networks and mobile service
    providers was driven by capacity expansion and by network
    upgrades to provide high-reliability, high-bandwidth
    applications.

The decrease in operating income was primarily due to
    $39.6 million of inventory write-downs and severance costs
    associated with product discontinuances and the shut-down of our
    manufacturing activities in Montreal, Canada. During the second
    quarter of fiscal 2006, the Harris Stratex Networks segment
    successfully released additional frequencies of the
    TRuepoint

tm

product family, essentially completing all frequencies intended
    to be offered in the low- and mid-capacity microwave radio
    market segments. In light of these releases, and the market
    acceptance of previously released frequencies as demonstrated by
    TRuepoint

tm

product sales, management announced during the second quarter of
    fiscal 2006 a manufacturer’s discontinuance
    (“MD”) of the MicroStar
    M/H

tm

,
    MicroStar
    L

tm

and
    Galaxy

tm

product families (the product families the
    TRuepoint

tm

product line was developed to replace) and of the
    ClearBurst

tm

product family, a product line that shares manufacturing
    facilities with the
    MicroStar

tm

and the
    Galaxy

tm

product lines in Montreal, Canada. In November 2005, letters
    were sent to
    MicroStar

tm

,
    Galaxy

tm

and
    ClearBurst

tm

customers, informing them of the MD announcement.

We estimated expected demand for these products based on:
    responses to the letters noted above and a percentage of the
    installed base, using previous product MD history as a basis for
    this estimate. In addition, the customer service inventory of
    these discontinued products was reviewed and quantities required
    to support existing warranty obligations and contractual
    obligations were quantified. These analyses identified inventory
    held in multiple locations including Montreal, Canada; Redwood
    Shores, California; San Antonio, Texas; Paris, France;
    Mexico City, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Shenzhen, China. As
    a result of these analyses, $34.0 million of inventory was
    written down in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Also,
    $5.6 million of severance and other costs were recorded in
    fiscal 2006 related to the shutdown of manufacturing activities
    in our Montreal, Canada plant and product discontinuances. The
    inventory reserved for in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was
    subsequently disposed of or scrapped. No additional material
    costs or charges are expected to be incurred in connection with
    these product discontinuances.

The decrease in fiscal 2006 gross margins and operating
    income associated with the product discontinuances noted above
    were partially offset by improved gross margins in fiscal 2006
    as a result of increased shipments of
    TRuepoint

tm

,
    a family of lower-cost microwave radios, and a shift away from
    lower-margin international projects. Engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2006 when compared
    to fiscal 2005 as a result of increased selling expenses and
    stock and cash based compensation plan expenses.

Orders in our Harris Stratex Networks segment increased
    21 percent from $332 million in fiscal 2005 to
    $402 million in fiscal 2006. Significant orders received in
    this segment during fiscal 2006 included:

•

$58 million in orders from Vmobile Nigeria as part of a
    contract to provide radios for its transmission and transport
    network spanning more than 5,000 kilometers.

•

A $14 million order from the Commonwealth of Kentucky as
    part of a state-wide, three-year, potential $42 million
    program to transition the Kentucky Early Warning System from
    analog to digital technology using
    TRuepoint

tm

radios.



•

Significant international orders received from customers in
    Nigeria, Canada, Mexico, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Romania, Brazil and
    Zambia.

•

Various other large orders from private network and major mobile
    telecommunications providers in North America.

Fiscal 2007 Compared With Fiscal
    2006:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue increased 11.3 percent and operating income
    decreased 47.8 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The
    increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the full year
    benefit of the acquisitions of Leitch and Aastra Digital Video
    made during fiscal 2006 and increased demand for our Video
    Infrastructure & Digital Media products. Investments
    in analog-to-digital and HD systems are enabling content
    providers and broadcasters to create, manage and deliver
    additional channels and video streams to consumers. HD
    Radio

®

Transmission systems revenue also increased as a result of
    further penetration of the new Harris
    Flexstar

tm

exciter. Revenue was lower in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal
    2006 in U.S. DTV transmission and software solutions
    products. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we exited
    our radio resale distribution channel, which involved sales of
    non-Harris OEM radio products at low gross margins, sold
    primarily through a telemarketing group.

Operating income in fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by an
    $18.9 million write-down of capitalized software and a
    $7.5 million charge related to cost-reduction actions. The
    write-down of capitalized software was a result of
    management’s decision to discontinue a software development
    effort. Income was also negatively impacted by the significant
    decline in U.S. DTV transmission and software solutions revenue,
    and by increased expenses associated with the investment and
    deployment of new software products including OSi
    Traffic

tm

,
    H-Class

tm

Digital Asset Management.

Orders in our Broadcast Communications segment increased
    30.3 percent from $511 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $666 million in fiscal 2007. Significant orders received by
    our Broadcast Communications segment during fiscal 2007 included:

•

Video Infrastructure & Digital Media orders from: NFL
    Productions; Turner Broadcasting Systems; Fox Sports; Madison
    Square Garden Network and Anteon Corporation. These orders
    provide media solutions across multiple workflow areas such as
    newsroom editing, video processing and channel release.

•

Transmission Systems orders from: Technical Innovation LLC;
    Telediffusion in Algeria; Oromiya Regional State in Ethiopia;
    and CBS Radio.

•

    Group; Viasat; XM Satellite Radio; Disney Channel and Time
    Warner Cable.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Broadcast Communications segment
    revenue increased 40.2 percent and operating income
    increased 26.0 percent from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006.
    Leitch, which was acquired in October 2005, and Encoda,
    which was acquired in November 2004, were main contributors to
    the increase in segment revenue and operating income. The
    increase in revenue was also partly attributable to increased
    demand for DTV, NetVX networking, and HD Radio products.

Fiscal 2006 operating income for this segment was adversely
    impacted by a $25.0 million charge related to inventory
    write-downs, severance and other costs associated with
    cost-reduction actions. The cost-reduction actions were taken to
    address weakness in our international broadcast transmission
    markets and to further improve the segment’s profitability.
    These actions included closing our Huntingdon, United Kingdom
    facility; relocating manufacturing of European-standard
    transmission products to our Quincy, Illinois facility; reducing
    our infrastructure in Austria; outsourcing manufacturing of
    radio consoles and related products from our Mason, Ohio
    facility; and headcount reductions from further integration
    within our software systems business. Charges incurred in fiscal
    2006 related to these actions included $9.7 million of
    severance and other employee-related exit costs and
    $2.3 million of facility-related exit costs. These actions
    resulted in a headcount reduction of 150. The cost-reduction
    actions helped to significantly improve operating margins for
    this segment in fiscal 2006.



Research and development costs in this segment were higher in
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 because we continued to
    invest in new product development such as our
    H-Class

tm

broadcast enterprise software systems solution,
    FlexStar

®

HD Radio transmission products, next-generation video
    distribution and media products and transmission equipment for
    use in mobile video broadcasting applications.

During fiscal 2006, we made three strategic acquisitions in this
    segment. In October 2005, we completed the acquisition of
    Leitch, a publicly-held provider of high-performance video
    systems for the television broadcast industry. In April 2006, we
    completed the acquisition of OSi, a privately-held provider of
    air-time sales, traffic and billing software systems to over 350
    call-letter broadcast stations in North America. In May 2006, we
    completed the acquisition of Aastra Digital Video, a developer
    and marketer of video networking products.

Operating income was negatively impacted during fiscal 2006 by
    $11.9 million of charges related to our acquisition of
    Leitch, including the write-off of in-process research and
    development, lower margins being recognized subsequent to our
    acquisition due to a

step-up

of
    inventory taken at the acquisition date and integration
    activities. For further information related to the acquisition
    of Leitch, including the allocation of the purchase price and
    pro forma results as if Leitch had been acquired as of the
    beginning of the periods presented, see

Note 3: Business
    Combinations

in the Notes.

Orders in our Broadcast Communications segment increased
    66 percent from $308 million in fiscal 2005 to
    $511 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily
    due to the acquisitions of Leitch and Encoda. Significant orders
    received by our Broadcast Communications segment during fiscal
    2006 included:

•

TV transmission equipment orders from: Media General and
    Entravision in the U.S.; Swisscomm Broadcasting in Switzerland;
    StarTV in Indonesia; TV Azteca in Mexico; Bridge Networks in
    Australia; and Radiocommunicatii in Romania.

•

Radio transmission equipment orders from: Clear Channel
    Communications and other major broadcasters in the U.S.,
    including a multi-year agreement with Cumulus Broadcasting to

    $69.6 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of revenue,
    headquarters expense decreased from 2.2 percent in fiscal
    2006 to 1.6 percent in fiscal 2007. The decrease in
    headquarters expense was primarily due to a $5.4 million
    charge recorded in fiscal 2006 associated with a decision we
    received in our arbitration with Bourdex. Corporate eliminations
    decreased from $16.5 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $13.4 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to less
    intersegment activity on our FTI and Radiocommunicatii programs.

Fiscal 2006 Compared With Fiscal
    2005:

Headquarters expense increased
    30.0 percent from $58.0 million in fiscal 2005 to
    $75.4 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue,
    headquarters expense increased from 1.9 percent in fiscal
    2005 to 2.2 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    headquarters expense was primarily due to a $5.4 million
    charge associated with a decision we received in our arbitration
    with Bourdex. The increase in headquarters expense also included
    the impact of stock-based compensation expense, consulting fees
    and charitable contributions. Corporate eliminations were
    unchanged at $16.5 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006.



In-Process
    Research and Development

In connection with the combination with Stratex, we allocated
    $15.3 million of the purchase price to in-process research
    and development projects. These allocations represent the
    estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
    to the incomplete projects. At the date of the combination, the
    development of these projects had not yet reached technological
    feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
    alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
    as a charge to earnings and are included in engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses. In making these purchase price
    allocations we relied on present value calculations of income,
    an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and
    an assessment of overall contribution and project risk.

The value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
    development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
    the purchased in-process research and development into
    commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
    to their present value using a discount rate of 19 percent.

The Stratex projects were for the development of the next
    generation of the Eclipse product (“Next Generation
    Eclipse”). The Next Generation Eclipse product is expected
    to incorporate significant modifications to address
    carrier-grade Ethernet functionality. The functionality in the
    planned product is expected to represent the first significant
    jump related to capacity and capability associated with packet
    switching. As of the valuation date, this project was
    approximately 50 percent complete with initial product release
    expected in late calendar 2007 and had remaining costs until
    completion of approximately $3.4 million.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Our cash and
    cash equivalents increased by $187.0 million to
    $368.3 million at the end of fiscal 2007, primarily due to
    $438.6 million of cash flow generated from operating
    activities; $400.0 million in commercial paper issued to
    fund the acquisition of Multimax and $117.7 million of net
    proceeds from the sale of short-term investments. These
    increases were partially offset by a net $371.5 million of
    cash paid for acquisitions and combinations; $129.1 million
    of software and property, plant and equipment additions;
    $246.9 million of common stock repurchases and
    $58.2 million of cash dividends. We own 57 percent of
    Harris Stratex Networks, which had a cash and cash equivalents
    balance of $69.2 million included in our consolidated cash
    balance of $368.3 million as of June 29, 2007. The
    $69.2 million balance is available for general corporate
    purposes only by Harris Stratex Networks.

Management currently believes that existing cash, funds
    generated from operations, our credit facilities and access to
    the public and private debt and equity markets will be
    sufficient to provide for our anticipated requirements for
    working capital, capital expenditures and stock repurchases
    under the current repurchase program for the next 12 months
    and the foreseeable future. We anticipate tax payments over the
    next three years to be less than our tax expense during the same
    period. We anticipate that our fiscal 2008 cash payments may
    include strategic acquisitions. Other than those noted in the
    “Contractual Obligations” discussion below in this
    MD&A and potential acquisitions, no other significant cash
    payments are anticipated in fiscal 2008 and thereafter.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
    continue to generate cash flow at current levels, or that
    anticipated operational improvements will be achieved. If we are
    unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash
    flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be
    required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, terminate
    our stock repurchase program, reduce or eliminate dividends,
    refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain
    additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal
    payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness
    depends on our future performance and financial results, which,
    to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or
    affecting the government, defense, microwave communications and
    broadcast



communications markets and to general economic, political,
    financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
    beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    operating activities was $438.6 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to $334.2 million in fiscal 2006. All four of our
    segments generated positive cash flows in fiscal 2007 with RF
    Communications and Government Communications Systems posting
    significant improvements when compared to fiscal 2006. Fiscal
    2007 cash flow improvements resulted primarily from higher
    operating income in our RF Communications segment. Fiscal 2006
    cash provided by operating activities benefited from income tax
    refunds. We expect cash flow provided by operating activities in
    fiscal 2008 to be between $550 million and
    $600 million.

Net cash used in investing
    activities:

Our net cash used in investing
    activities was $382.9 million in fiscal 2007 compared to
    $768.6 million in fiscal 2006. Net cash used in investing
    activities in fiscal 2007 was due to a net $371.5 million
    cash paid for business acquisitions and combinations,
    $88.8 million additions of property, plant and equipment
    and $40.3 million additions of capitalized software offset
    by $117.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities in
    fiscal 2006 was due to $509.6 million cash paid for
    business acquisitions, $112.6 million net purchases of
    short-term investments, $101.8 million additions of
    property, plant and equipment and $44.6 million additions
    of capitalized software.

The decrease in our additions of capitalized software and
    property, plant and equipment from $146.4 million in fiscal
    2006 to $129.1 million in fiscal 2007 relates primarily to
    higher levels of software purchases in our Government
    Communications Systems segment in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2006
    expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity related to
    Falcon

®

II and
    Falcon

®

III radio production in our RF Communications segment. Our total
    additions of capitalized software and property, plant and
    equipment in fiscal 2008 are expected to be in the
    $140 million to $150 million range.

Net cash provided by financing
    activities:

Our net cash provided by
    financing activities in fiscal 2007 was $133.3 million
    compared to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal
    2006 of $236.4 million. The net cash provided by financing
    activities in fiscal 2007 was primarily from the issuance of
    $400.0 million in commercial paper issued in connection
    with the acquisition of Multimax. See

Note 12:
    Short-Term Debt

in the Notes for more information. The net
    cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2007 also
    included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
    $35.7 million. Fiscal 2007 cash provided by financing
    activities from the issuance of debt and proceeds from the
    exercise of employee stock options was partially offset by the
    payment of cash dividends totaling $58.2 million and the
    repurchase of common stock of $246.9 million. In fiscal
    2007, we issued 1,673,501 shares of common stock to
    employees under the terms of our option and incentive plans.

The net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2006 was
    primarily from the issuance of $300 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 5% Notes due October 1, 2015. See

Note 13: Long-Term Debt

in the Notes for more
    information. The net cash provided by financing activities in
    fiscal 2006 also included proceeds from the exercise of employee
    stock options of $33.8 million. Fiscal 2006 cash provided
    by financing activities from the issuance of debt and proceeds
    from the exercise of employee stock options was partially offset
    by the payment of cash dividends totaling $42.7 million and
    the repurchase of common stock of $44.9 million. In fiscal
    2006, we issued 1,697,526 shares of common stock to
    employees under the terms of our option and incentive plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

During fiscal 2007, we used $246.9 million to repurchase
    4,959,499 shares of our common stock at an average price
    per share of $49.79 including commissions. During fiscal 2006,
    we used $44.9 million to repurchase 1,050,000 shares
    of our common stock at an average price per share of $42.71
    including commissions. During fiscal 2007, our Board of
    Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing
    the repurchase of up to $600 million of our stock. While
    this program does not have a stated expiration date, we
    repurchased approximately $200 million of shares during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and management expects to
    repurchase the remaining $400 million of shares over the
    following eight quarters. We expect this new program to result
    in repurchases in excess of offsetting the dilutive effect of
    shares issued under our share-based incentive plans. Share
    repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash.
    Repurchases under the program may be made through open market
    purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through
    investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. The
    timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject to
    market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors
    and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued
    at any time. This share repurchase program replaced the prior
    share repurchase authorization. Additional information regarding
    repurchases made during fiscal 2007 and our repurchase programs
    is set forth above under Part II, “Item 5. Market
    For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”



Dividend
    Policy

On August 25, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a
    quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share, for an
    annualized rate of $0.60 per share, which was our sixth
    consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Our
    annual common stock dividend was $0.44, $0.32, and $0.24 per
    share in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional
    information concerning our dividends is set forth above under
    Part II, “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s
    Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities.”

Capital
    Structure and Resources

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans and letters of credit issuances at any time
    and from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement,
    in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
    exceed $500 million (we may request an increase, not to
    exceed an additional $250 million). The Credit Agreement
    may be used for working capital and other general corporate
    purposes and to support any commercial paper that we may issue.
    At our election, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear
    interest either at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the
    base rate. The base rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the
    higher of the Federal funds rate plus 0.50 percent or
    SunTrust Bank’s publicly announced prime lending rate. The
    Credit Agreement provides that the interest rate margin over
    LIBOR, initially set at 0.50 percent, will increase or
    decrease within certain limits based on changes in the ratings
    of our senior, unsecured long-term debt securities. We are also
    permitted to request borrowings with interest rates and terms
    that are to be set pursuant to competitive bid procedures or
    directly negotiated with a lender or lenders.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
    consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
    transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
    of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
    prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
    capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
    consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
    from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
    period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
    including: payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
    and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
    warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
    amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
    more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
    debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
    immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the Credit Agreement are due and mature on March 31,
    2010, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at
    our request or if certain events of default occur. At
    June 29, 2007, we had $400.0 million of commercial
    paper outstanding, which is backed by the Credit Agreement. We
    expect to refinance the commercial paper with long-term debt
    during the first half of fiscal 2008.

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on
    April 1 and October 1 of each year. We may redeem the notes in
    whole, or in part, at any time at the “make-whole”
    redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price is
    equal to the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount
    of the notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of
    the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

year
    consisting of twelve

30-day

months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined, plus 15 basis
    points. In each case, we will pay accrued interest on the
    principal amount of the notes being redeemed to the redemption
    date. We incurred $4.1 million in debt issuance costs and
    discounts related to the issuance of the notes, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period and
    reflected as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022.
    These debentures were convertible into shares of our common
    stock at a conversion price of $22.625 during any calendar
    quarter if the closing price of our common stock, for at least
    20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
    on the last trading day of the prior calendar quarter, was more
    than $24.8875, and in certain other circumstances. On
    July 12, 2007, we initiated the steps necessary to redeem
    these debentures on August 20, 2007. However, prior to the
    date set for redemption, all of the debentures were converted by
    the holders into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate
    of 44.2404 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal



amount of debentures, with the exception of debentures in the
    principal amount of $3,000. This resulted in the issuance by us
    of 6,594,146 shares of common stock during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 in respect of the debentures converted.
    On August 20, 2007, we redeemed the remaining debentures in
    the principal amount of $3,000. Accordingly, no debentures
    remain outstanding as of August 20, 2007.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. We may redeem the debentures in whole, or
    in part, at any time after February 2, 2008 at a
    pre-determined redemption price. Holders may require us to repay
    all or a portion of the debentures on February 1, 2008 at
    100 percent of the principal amount of the debentures being
    redeemed plus accrued interest.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. These debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
    potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

Prior to the combination with Stratex, Stratex was a party to a
    credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, and following the
    combination, Stratex (now named “Harris Stratex Networks
    Operating Corporation” and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Harris Stratex Networks), remains a party to the credit facility
    with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility”). Harris and its subsidiaries (other than
    Harris Stratex Networks Operating Corporation) are not parties
    to the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility and are not
    obligated under, or guarantors of, the Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility. Indebtedness under the Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as a result of the consolidation in the consolidated financial
    statements of the financial results of Harris Stratex Networks.
    The Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility allows for revolving
    credit borrowings of up to $50 million, with available
    credit defined as $50 million less the outstanding balance
    of the term loan portion and any usage under the revolving
    credit portion. As of June 29, 2007, the balance of the
    term loan portion of the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility
    was $19.5 million (of which $10.7 million is recorded
    in the current portion of long-term debt) and there was
    $6.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit,
    which are defined as usage under the revolving credit portion of
    the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility. Term Loan A of the
    Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility requires monthly
    principal payments by Harris Stratex Networks Operating
    Corporation of $0.5 million plus interest at a fixed rate
    of 6.38 percent through May 2008. Term Loan B of the Harris
    Stratex Networks Credit Facility requires monthly principal
    payments by Harris Stratex Networks Operating Corporation of
    $0.4 million plus interest at a fixed rate of 7.25 percent
    through March 2010. The Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility
    agreement contains a minimum tangible net worth covenant and a
    liquidity ratio covenant. At June 29, 2007, Harris Stratex
    Networks Operating Corporation was in compliance with these
    financial covenants.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $14.7 million from various international banks,
    $13.3 million of which was available on June 29, 2007.
    These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
    typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
    terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and us and are reviewed
    annually for renewal or modification. These lines do not require
    compensating balances. We have a short-term commercial paper
    program in place, which we may utilize to satisfy short-term
    cash requirements. There was $400 million outstanding under
    the commercial paper program at June 29, 2007.

Our debt is currently rated “BBB+” by Standard and
    Poor’s Rating Group and “Baa2” by Moody’s
    Investors Service. We expect to maintain operating ratios,
    fixed-charge coverage ratios and balance sheet ratios sufficient
    for retention of or improvement to these debt ratings. There are
    no assurances that our credit ratings will not be reduced in the
    future. If our credit rating is lowered below “investment
    grade,” then we may not be able to issue short-term
    commercial paper, but may instead need to borrow under our
    credit facilities or pursue other options. We do not currently
    foresee losing our investment-grade debt ratings, but no
    assurances can be given. If our debt ratings were downgraded,
    however, it could adversely impact, among other things, our
    future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.



Contractual
    Obligations

At June 29, 2007, we had contractual cash obligations to
    repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments
    under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term
    obligations are as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the
    following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•

A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an
    unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement
    that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
    entity for such assets;

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain
    derivative instruments; and

•

Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a
    material variable interest held by the registrant in an
    unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
    risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in
    leasing, hedging or research and development services with the
    registrant.

During the quarter ended September 29, 2006, our Broadcast
    Communications segment entered into an agreement to sell
    products and services to a customer in connection with the
    customer’s prime contract to provide 19 transmission
    stations to a state agency. Pursuant to the terms of the prime
    contract, the customer was required to post a $20 million
    bond in favor of the agency to secure the customer’s
    obligations under the prime contract. In order to facilitate the
    issuance of the bond, we entered into an agreement with the
    customer and the bond surety to provide additional indemnity to
    the surety in the event the surety incurs any loss by reason of
    executing such bond. Our indemnity obligations are supported by,
    among other things, $2 million in irrevocable standby
    letters of credit obtained by the customer in our favor; a
    guarantee from the customer, as primary guarantor, in our favor
    of up to approximately $11 million; personal guarantees
    from certain principals of the customer, as secondary
    guarantors, in our favor of up to approximately $11 million
    in the aggregate; an additional fee payable by the customer to
    us of up to $300,000; certain additional undertakings by the
    customer to us with respect to the amount of our products and
    services to be sold by us to the customer in connection with the
    customer’s prime contract with the agency; an agreement by
    the customer to use best efforts to include us in any resolution
    procedure should default be declared or a claim be made to the
    bond; and an agreement with the customer, to the extent the
    customer is able, recommending we “step into” the
    customer’s place in the event the customer is not able to
    perform under the prime contract with the agency. The bond may
    remain outstanding until February 2010. We believe that the
    technical, project and financial risks associated with our
    agreement to provide additional indemnity to the surety is
    remote and should not have a material effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Currently we are not participating in transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do
    not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets
    as defined above. As of June 29, 2007, we did not have
    material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments
    that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In
    addition, we are not currently a



party to any related party transactions that materially affect
    our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses
    and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often
    provide representations, warranties

and/or

indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such
    as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot
    estimate the potential liability from such representations,
    warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown
    conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities
    relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities
    will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to
    acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain
    properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. In
    the event any of these third parties vacate any of these
    premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease
    arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by
    such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not
    material to our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Commercial
    Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course
    of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit
    agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions
    and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future
    performance on certain contracts to provide products and
    services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our
    insurance carriers. At June 29, 2007, we had commercial
    commitments on outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and
    other arrangements, as follows:

Financial
    Risk Management

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency:

We use
    foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance
    sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments.
    Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign
    currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from
    suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed sales
    to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use of
    foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks
    that arise from doing business in international markets. At
    June 29, 2007, we had open foreign exchange contracts with
    a notional amount of $107.2 million, of which
    $29.8 million were classified as cash flow hedges,
    $40.0 million were classified as fair value hedges and
    $37.4 million were not designated hedges under the
    provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“Statement 133”). This compares to
    total foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of
    $45.7 million at June 30, 2006, of which
    $15.7 million were classified as cash flow hedges and
    $30.0 million were classified as fair value hedges. At
    June 29, 2007, contract expiration dates ranged from less
    than one month to 18 months with a weighted average
    contract life of 2 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
    cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
    exposures from cash flows anticipated in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment related to customer



orders denominated in non-functional currencies that are
    currently in backlog and in our RF Communications segment
    related to programs in the U.K. and Canada and payments to a
    vendor in the U.K. that is supporting one of our government
    contracts in our Government Communications Systems segment. As
    of June 29, 2007, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
    $0.2 million would be reclassified into net income from
    comprehensive income within the next 18 months related to
    these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
    hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. Amounts
    recognized in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005
    related to the component of the derivative instruments’
    gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
    were also not material. In addition, no amounts were recognized
    in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 related to
    hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
    hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
    value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with
    Statement 133.

Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging
    programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales
    estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and
    availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent adverse
    change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency
    derivatives held at June 29, 2007 would have an impact of
    approximately $5.2 million on the fair value of such
    instruments. This quantification of exposure to the market risk
    associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not
    take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair
    value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments.

Interest Rates:

We utilize a balanced
    mix of debt maturities along with both fixed-rate and
    variable-rate debt and available lines of credit to manage our
    exposure to changes in interest rates. We do not expect changes
    in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash
    flows in fiscal 2008, although there can be no assurances that
    interest rates will not change significantly.

Impact of
    Foreign Exchange

Approximately 36 percent of our international business was
    transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2007,
    compared to 44 percent in fiscal 2006. The impact of
    translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to
    U.S. dollars is included as a component of
    shareholders’ equity. At June 29, 2007, the cumulative
    translation adjustment increased shareholders’ equity by
    $24.3 million compared to an increase of $11.8 million
    at June 30, 2006. We utilize foreign currency hedging
    instruments to minimize the currency risk of international
    transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate
    fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Impact of
    Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the
    practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of
    inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the
    cost of purchased materials and services.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
    of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant
    accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

in the Notes. In preparing
    our financial statements and accounting for the underlying
    transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and
    estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the estimates
    discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial
    statements because their application places the most significant
    demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results
    relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical
    accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs.
    The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates
    on our business operations are discussed throughout this
    MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected
    financial results. Senior management has discussed the
    development and selection of the critical accounting policies
    and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with
    the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
    those estimates.

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting
    estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in
    preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
    estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are
    based on experience and other information available prior to the
    issuance of the financial



statements. Materially different results can occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known,
    including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”

Revenue
    Recognition on Development and Production Contracts and Contract
    Estimates

A significant portion of our business is derived from
    development and production contracts, which are accounted for
    under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified
    Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) audit and
    accounting guide, “Audits of Federal Government
    Contractors,” and the AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”),

and cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. Government
    also are specifically accounted for in accordance with
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 11,
    Section A, “Government Contracts, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee
    Contracts” (“ARB 43”).

Revenue related to development and production contracts is
    recorded using the percentage-of-completion method generally
    measured by the costs incurred on each contract to-date against
    estimated total contract costs at completion
    (“cost-to-cost”) with consideration given for risk of
    performance and estimated profit. The percentage-of-completion
    method of revenue recognition is primarily used in our
    Government Communications Systems and RF Communications
    segments. Revenue is recorded on certain development and
    production contracts using the units-of-delivery method rather
    than the cost-to-cost method. Under the units-of-delivery
    method, sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
    actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered
    under the contract. Amounts representing contract change orders,
    claims or other items that may change the scope of a contract
    are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated
    and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties and award
    fees applicable to performance on contracts are considered in
    estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there
    is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
    performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
    solely on a single significant event, generally are not
    recognized until the event occurs. Contracts generally are not
    segmented. If contracts are segmented, they meet the segmenting
    criteria stated in

SOP 81-1.

Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a
    single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit
    for each contract over its entire period of performance.
    Recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price
    contracts requires estimates of: the contract value or total
    contract revenue, the total cost at completion, and the
    measurement of progress toward completion. The estimated profit
    or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the
    estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at
    completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our programs,
    developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires
    significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in
    estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity
    and availability of labor, the nature and complexity of the work
    to be performed, availability and cost of materials,
    subcontractor performance, the impact of delayed performance,
    availability and timing of funding from the customer and the
    recoverability of claims outside the original contract included
    in any estimate to complete. We review cost performance and
    estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least
    quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If a change in
    estimated cost to complete a contract is determined to have an
    impact on contract earnings, we will record a positive or
    negative adjustment to estimated earnings when identified.
    Revenue and profits on a cost-reimbursable contract are
    recognized when allowable costs are incurred in an amount equal
    to the allowable costs plus the profit on those costs. These
    profits may be at a fixed or variable percentage of allowable
    costs, depending on the contract fee arrangement. Thus,
    cost-reimbursable contracts generally are not subject to the
    same estimation risks that affect fixed-price contracts. We have
    not made any material changes in the methodologies used to
    recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to
    estimate our costs related to development and production
    contracts in the past three fiscal years.

As of June 29, 2007, the amount of unbilled costs and
    accrued earnings on fixed-price contracts classified as
    Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was
    $209.7 million compared to $137.3 million as of
    June 30, 2006. These amounts include gross costs and
    accrued income, which is netted against billings and progress
    payments. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    programs could have a material effect on our statement of
    financial position and results of operations. For example, a one
    percent variance in our estimate of accrued income booked as of
    June 29, 2007 on all open fixed-price contracts would
    impact our pre-tax income and our revenue from product sales and
    services by $10.1 million.

Provisions
    for Excess and Obsolete Inventory Losses

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
    balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure
    competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or
    obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer
    requirements. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand
    and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
    primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand,
    anticipated end of product life and production requirements. The
    review of excess and obsolete inventory primarily relates to all
    of our



business segments. Several factors may influence the sale and
    use of our inventories, including our decisions to exit a
    product line, technological change and new product development.
    These factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete
    inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of
    future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case
    we may have understated or overstated the provision required for
    excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine
    that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to
    recognize such costs in “Cost of product sales” in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income at the time of such
    determination. In the case of goods which have been written down
    below cost at the close of a fiscal year, such reduced amount is
    to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. We
    have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology
    used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past
    three fiscal years.

As of June 29, 2007, our reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory was $55.9 million, or 9.1 percent of our
    gross inventory balance, which compares to our reserve of
    $69.7 million, or 12.9 percent of our gross inventory
    balance as of June 30, 2006. We recorded
    $26.6 million, $81.3 million and $4.0 million in
    inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess
    and obsolete inventory or our pre-tax income during fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2006, we had significant
    write-downs in inventory due to the discontinuance of legacy
    products in our Harris Stratex Networks segment and the
    relocation of European manufacturing activities in our Broadcast
    Communications segment. Although we make every reasonable effort
    to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product
    demand, including the impact of planned future product launches,
    any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and our reported operating results.

Goodwill

Under the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets” (“Statement 142”), we are required to
    perform an annual (or, under certain circumstances, more
    frequent) impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment
    is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
    which we define as our business segments, with its total assets,
    including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets
    as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
    its adjusted total assets, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted total assets of a reporting
    unit exceed its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
    The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized
    intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
    a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
    was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. We
    have not made any material changes in the methodology used to
    determine the valuation of our goodwill or the assessment of
    whether or not goodwill is impaired during the past three fiscal
    years.

There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the
    determination of the fair value of a reporting unit. These
    assumptions include projected cash flows, discount rates,
    comparable market prices of similar businesses, recent
    acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace and a
    review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying
    business. We completed impairment tests as of March 30,
    2007, with no adjustment required to the carrying value of
    goodwill. Goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006 was
    $1,525.2 million and $951.1 million, respectively.
    Although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy
    of our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, future
    changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could
    result in the recording of an impairment loss. A 10 percent
    decrease in our estimate of the fair value of any one of our
    four segments would not lead to further tests for impairment as
    described above.

Income
    Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowances

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very
    specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction
    regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the
    balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as
    required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately
    depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
    appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital
    gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available
    under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets
    for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected
    future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
    existing temporary differences and tax



planning strategies. We have not made any material changes in
    the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances
    during the past three fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 29, 2007 includes
    a current deferred tax asset of $94.3 million and a
    non-current deferred tax liability of $61.8 million. This
    compares to a current deferred tax asset of $105.0 million
    and a non-current deferred tax liability of $28.6 million
    as of June 30, 2006. For all jurisdictions for which we
    have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels
    of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of
    future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. Our
    valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is
    reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was
    $167.9 million as of June 29, 2007 and
    $70.4 million as of June 30, 2006. The increase in
    valuation allowance from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 is primarily
    due to acquired deferred tax assets, any realization of which
    will be reflected as a change in goodwill. Although we make
    every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our deferred
    tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain
    jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future
    taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual
    effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying
    temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be
    required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a
    significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a
    substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material
    adverse impact on our operating results.

Stock
    Options and Share-Based Compensation

Effective July 2, 2005, we adopted Statement 123R, which
    requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense
    for all stock-based payments made to our employees, including
    employee stock option, performance share, performance unit,
    restricted stock and restricted unit awards based on estimated
    fair value. We previously applied the provisions of Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
    25”) and related interpretations and provided the required
    pro forma disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (“Statement 123”).

We adopted Statement 123R using the modified prospective
    transition method beginning in fiscal 2006. Accordingly, during
    fiscal 2006 we recorded stock-based compensation expense for
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, the beginning
    of fiscal 2006 as if the fair value method required for pro
    forma disclosure under Statement 123 were in effect for expense
    recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. For
    stock-based awards granted after the beginning of fiscal 2006,
    we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant
    date fair value method required under Statement 123R. The
    compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a
    straight-line amortization method. Our net income for fiscal
    2007 includes a stock-based compensation expense of
    $28.7 million compared to fiscal 2006 stock-based
    compensation expense of $18.6 million. As of June 29,
    2007, the total unrecorded stock-based compensation balance for
    unvested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was
    $56.1 million, which is expected to be amortized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

While fair value may be readily determinable for awards of
    stock, market quotes are not available for long-term,
    nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not
    traded. We currently use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
    model to estimate the fair value of stock options. Option
    valuation models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, including but not limited to stock price volatility
    and stock option exercise behavior. We expect to continue to use
    the Black-Scholes-Merton model for valuing our stock-based
    compensation expense. Our estimate of grant date fair value and
    stock-based compensation expense is affected by a number of
    complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax
    effect. These valuation assumptions include, but are not limited
    to, the volatility of our stock price, expected life and stock
    option exercise behaviors. We have not made any material changes
    in the methodologies used to determine the assumptions we use to
    estimate the fair value of our stock options during the past
    three fiscal years.

A change in any of these assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated fair value of any given grant and cause our results to
    be materially different. For example, a one-year increase in the
    estimated term of our stock options granted during fiscal 2007
    would have increased our compensation expense by
    $0.8 million in fiscal 2007 and a 400 basis-point increase
    in the assumed volatility rate of our stock options granted
    during fiscal 2007 would have increased our compensation expense
    by $0.5 million in fiscal 2007. See

Note 14: Stock
    Options and Share-Based Compensation

in the Notes for
    further information related to stock options and share-based
    compensation.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

As described in

Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent
    Pronouncements

in the Notes, there are accounting
    pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet
    been implemented by us.

Note 2

describes the



potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have
    on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from expected and historical
    results. Other factors besides those listed here also could
    adversely affect us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
    above for more information regarding factors that might cause
    our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied
    by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

•

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
    economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth
    in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•

We depend on the U.S. Government for a significant portion
    of our revenue, and the loss of this relationship or a shift in
    U.S. Government funding priorities could have adverse
    consequences on our future business.

•

We depend significantly on our U.S. Government contracts,
    which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate
    termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination
    or failure to fund one or more of these contracts could have an
    adverse impact on our business.

•

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to
    losses in the event of cost overruns.

•

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from
    international operations and are subject to the risks of doing
    business internationally, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates.

•

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new
    products that achieve market acceptance.

•

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political
    events, but they may affect adversely the markets in which we
    operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or
    our profitability.

•

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions
    that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

•

The inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key
    suppliers to deliver our components or products, could cause our
    products to be produced in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

•

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the
    future that we are infringing upon their intellectual property
    rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual
    property rights.

•

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are
    involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such
    matter could have a material adverse affect on our financial
    position and results of operations.

•

We are subject to customer credit risk.

•

Developing new technologies entails significant risks and
    uncertainties.

•

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

•

Our consolidated financial results may be impacted by Harris
    Stratex Networks’ financial results, which may vary
    significantly and be difficult to forecast.

•

We have significant operations in Florida that could be
    materially and adversely impacted in the event of a hurricane,
    and operations in California that could be materially and
    adversely impacted in the event of an earthquake.

•

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments

and/or

recorded goodwill to become impaired, resulting in substantial
    losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of
    operations.

•

In order to be successful, we must attract and retain key
    employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the
    risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and
    procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage
    our exposure to such risks. For a discussion of such policies
    and procedures and the related risks, see “Financial Risk
    Management” in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” which is incorporated by reference into this
    Item 7A.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Harris Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
    appropriate cost-benefit analysis, regarding the reliability of
    our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 29,
    2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on management’s assessment and those
    criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    June 29, 2007.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
    internal controls of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Harris
    Stratex Networks”), the Company’s majority-owned
    subsidiary which resulted from the combination of the
    Company’s former Microwave Communications Division with
    Stratex Networks, Inc. during fiscal 2007, and the internal
    controls of Multimax Incorporated (“Multimax”), which
    was acquired by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007. Harris Stratex Networks and Multimax are included in the
    2007 consolidated financial statements of the Company. Harris
    Stratex Networks constituted $941.8 million and
    $731.1 million of total assets and net assets,
    respectively, as of June 29, 2007. Harris Stratex
    Networks’ revenue was $508.0 million for the year
    ended June 29, 2007. Harris Stratex Networks’ total
    assets and net assets as of June 29, 2007 were
    21 percent and 38 percent of the Company’s total
    assets and net assets, respectively. Harris Stratex
    Networks’ revenue for the year ended June 29, 2007 was
    12 percent of the Company’s total revenue. Multimax
    constituted $459.5 million and $402.6 million of total
    assets and net assets, respectively, as of June 29, 2007.
    Multimax’s total assets and net assets as of June 29,
    2007 were 10 percent and 21 percent of the
    Company’s total assets and net assets, respectively.
    Management will include the internal controls of each of Harris
    Stratex Networks and Multimax in its assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting for fiscal 2008.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on
    management’s assessment and the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This
    report appears on page 59.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
    Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Harris Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, cash flows, and comprehensive income and
    shareholders’ equity, for each of the three years in the
    period ended June 29, 2007. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Harris Corporation and subsidiaries at
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, and the consolidated
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended June 29, 2007, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
    material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Harris Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 29, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated August 24, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Harris
    Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Harris Corporation maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    June 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Harris Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Harris Stratex
    Networks”) or the internal controls of Multimax
    Incorporated (“Multimax”), which are included in the
    2007 consolidated financial statements of Harris Corporation.
    Harris Stratex Networks constituted $941.8 million and
    $731.1 million of total assets and net assets,
    respectively, as of June 29, 2007 and $508.0 million
    of revenues for the year then ended. Multimax constituted
    $459.5 million and $402.6 million of total assets and
    net assets, respectively, as of June 29, 2007. Our audit of
    internal control over financial reporting of Harris Corporation
    also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over
    financial reporting of Harris Stratex Networks or an evaluation
    of the internal control over financial reporting of Multimax.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Harris
    Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of June 29, 2007, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
    opinion, Harris Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of June 29, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Harris Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006,
    and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
    and comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity, for each
    of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2007 and
    our report dated August 24, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Harris Corporation
    and its subsidiaries. As used in these Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the terms “Harris,”
    “we,” “our” and “us” refer to
    Harris Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
    Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
    eliminated.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include 100
    percent of the assets and liabilities of our majority-owned
    subsidiary, Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Harris Stratex
    Networks”), and the 43 percent ownership interest of the
    minority stockholders of Harris Stratex Networks is recorded in
    “Minority interest in Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.”
    in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Significant intercompany
    transactions and accounts have been eliminated. References to
    Harris Stratex Networks include its consolidated subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates

— These consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
    expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based
    on experience and other information available prior to issuance
    of the financial statements. Materially different results can
    occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes
    known.

Fiscal Year

— Our fiscal year ends on the
    Friday nearest June 30. Fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005
    all include 52 weeks.

Common Stock Split

— On February 25, 2005,
    our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the
    form of a 100 percent stock dividend to our stockholders of
    record on March 14, 2005. The distribution of shares was
    completed on March 30, 2005. The total number of authorized
    shares and associated par value were unchanged by this action.
    As required, we transferred on our books the par value of $1 per
    share for each share distributed on March 30, 2005 from
    other capital to common stock. All share and per-share amounts
    in the Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Statement
    of Comprehensive Income and Shareholders’ Equity and these
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the stock
    split, applied retroactively, for all periods presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    are temporary cash investments with a maturity of three or fewer
    months when purchased. These investments include accrued
    interest and are carried at the lower of cost or market.

Short-term Investments

— We invest in
    high-quality securities to ensure that cash is readily available
    for use in our current operations. Investments with original
    maturities greater than three months are accounted for in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
    and Equity Securities” (“Statement 115”), and are
    classified accordingly at the time of purchase. At June 29,
    2007, our short-term investments available-for-sale consisted of
    $12.8 million of corporate notes, $4.8 million of
    government notes and $2.8 million of investment grade
    auction rate securities. With the exception of the auction rate
    securities and one corporate note with a market value of
    $0.6 million and a maturity of 13 months, all of the
    short-term investments available-for-sale have maturity dates of
    less than one year. At June 30, 2006, our short-term
    investments available-for-sale consisted of $112.6 million
    of investment grade auction rate securities.

Our investment grade auction rate securities include preferred
    stock with no maturity and investment grade auction rate
    municipal notes and bonds with maturities that could be up to
    46 years. These investments have characteristics similar to
    short-term investments, because at pre-determined intervals,
    generally ranging from 28 to 49 days, there is a new
    auction process at which the interest rates for these auction
    rate securities are reset to current interest rates. At the end
    of such period, we choose to roll-over our holdings or redeem
    the investments for cash. A “market maker” facilitates
    the redemption of the auction rate securities, and the
    underlying issuers are not required to redeem the investment
    within 90 days. All of these short-term investments are
    classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Due
    to the frequent nature of the reset feature, the
    investment’s market price approximates its fair value;
    therefore, there are no significant realized or unrealized gains
    or losses associated with these investments.

Marketable Securities

— Marketable securities
    available-for-sale are accounted for in accordance with
    Statement 115, and are classified accordingly at the time of
    purchase. We consider all our available-for-sale securities as
    available for use in our current operations. All of our
    marketable securities are classified as available-



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for-sale and are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and
    losses, net of tax, included as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from
    marketable securities available-for-sale are determined using
    the specific identification method. In instances where a
    security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the
    security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same
    security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount
    estimated to reflect such restrictions. If an “other than
    temporary” impairment is determined to exist, the
    difference between the value of the investment security recorded
    on the financial statements and our current estimate of fair
    value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in
    which the impairment is determined.

The cost basis of marketable securities available-for-sale at
    June 29, 2007, consisting primarily of our investment in
    AuthenTec, Inc. (“AuthenTec”), was $13.4 million.
    The cost basis of marketable securities at June 30, 2006,
    consisting primarily of our investment in AuthenTec, was
    $10.5 million. Our investment in AuthenTec consisted of
    convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase additional
    preferred stock. See the caption “Reclassifications”
    in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

for
    additional information.

Selected Investments

— Selected investments are
    investments in securities that do not have readily determinable
    fair values. Selected investments are accounted for using the
    cost method of accounting and are evaluated for impairment if
    cost exceeds fair value. The determination of fair value
    requires management to obtain independent appraisals, or to
    estimate the value of the securities without an independent
    appraisal based upon available information such as projected
    cash flows, comparable market prices of similar companies,
    recent acquisitions of similar companies made in the marketplace
    and a review of the financial and market conditions of the
    underlying company. “Non-operating income (loss)” in
    our Consolidated Statement of Income included a write-down of
    $19.8 million related to our investment in Terion, Inc.
    (“Terion”) due to an other-than-temporary impairment
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and a $1.8 million
    gain in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from proceeds
    received from Terion following Terion’s sale of
    substantially all of its assets on January 10, 2007. In
    fiscal 2006, “Non-operating income (loss)” in our
    Consolidated Statement of Income included a write-down of
    $4.0 million related to our investment in Terion due to an
    other-than-temporary impairment. The write-down was the result
    of less than expected operating results and downward revisions
    of forecasted future results. As a result of our receipt of
    proceeds from Terion following the sale as described above we
    have no selected investments at June 29, 2007. At
    June 30, 2006, we had a $23.0 million investment in
    Terion included in “Other assets” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for
    cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
    available-for-sale, marketable securities available-for-sale,
    cost method investments, non-current receivables, notes
    receivable and short-term and long-term debt approximate their
    fair values, except for our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due
    2022, which as of June 29, 2007 have a fair value of
    $359.7 million compared to a carrying value of
    $149.1 million. Fair values are based primarily on quoted
    market prices for those or similar instruments or independent
    appraisals. A discussion of fair values for our derivative
    financial instruments is included under the caption
    “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” in this

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

.

Accounts Receivable

— We record receivables at
    net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for
    estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated
    on the accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision
    for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our
    history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic
    status of the customers. See

Note 5: Receivables

for
    additional information regarding accounts receivable.

Inventories

— Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost (determined by average and

first-in,

first-out methods) or market. We regularly review inventory
    quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and
    obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
    product demand and production requirements. See

Note 6:
    Inventories

for additional information regarding inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are carried on the basis of cost. Depreciation of
    buildings, machinery and equipment is computed by the
    straight-line and accelerated methods. The estimated useful
    lives of buildings generally range between 3 and 45 years.
    The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment generally
    range between 2 and 10 years. Software capitalized for
    internal use is accounted for in accordance with the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”).

Amortization of internal use software begins when the software
    is put into service and is based on the expected useful life of
    the software. The useful life over which we amortize
    internal-use software ranges from two years to five years. See

Note 7:

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

for additional information
    regarding property, plant and equipment. Also, see the caption
    “Reclassifications” in this

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies

for additional information.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess cost
    of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets
    acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets” (“Statement 142”), indefinite-life
    identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
    Under the provisions of Statement 142, we are required to
    perform an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent)
    impairment test of our goodwill. Goodwill impairment is
    determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential
    impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit,
    which we define as our business segments, with its total assets,
    including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets
    as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
    its adjusted total assets, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment
    test is unnecessary. If the adjusted total assets of a reporting
    unit exceed its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
    The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized
    intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
    a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
    was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. See

Note 8: Goodwill

for additional information
    regarding goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

— We assess the recoverability of the
    carrying value of our long-lived assets and identifiable
    intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
    assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
    such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash
    flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future
    undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of
    the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between
    the fair value and the carrying amount. Identifiable intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
    lives. See

Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment

and

Note 9: Identifiable Intangible Assets

for
    additional information regarding long-lived assets and
    identifiable intangible assets.

Capitalized Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed

— Capitalized software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed is accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, “Accounting
    for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
    Otherwise Marketed” (“Statement 86”). Costs
    incurred to acquire or create a computer software product are
    expensed when incurred as research and development until
    technological feasibility has been established for the product,
    at which point such costs are capitalized. Technological
    feasibility is normally established upon completion of a
    detailed program design. Capitalization of computer software
    costs ceases when the product is available for general release
    to customers. Costs of reproduction, documentation, training
    materials, physical packaging, maintenance and customer support
    are charged to cost of products sold when related revenue is
    recognized. Capitalized software is evaluated for impairment
    periodically by comparing the unamortized capitalized costs of a
    computer software product to the net realizable value of that
    product. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an
    $18.9 million write-down of capitalized software in our
    Broadcast Communications segment. The write-down was a result of
    management’s decision to discontinue an automation software
    development effort. This write-down is included in the
    “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses”
    line item of the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Capitalized software accounted for under Statement 86 had a net
    carrying value of $41.0 million at June 29, 2007 and
    $41.7 million at June 30, 2006. Total amortization
    expense related to these capitalized software amounts for fiscal
    2007, 2006 and 2005 was $4.1 million, $2.2 million and
    $1.9 million, respectively. The annual amortization of
    capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed
    using (a) the ratio that current gross revenues for a
    product bear to the total of current and anticipated future
    gross revenues for that product or (b) the straight-line
    method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
    product. Based on this policy, the useful lives over which we
    amortize costs of computer software to be sold, leased or
    otherwise marketed range from three years to seven years.
    Amortization commences when the product is available for general
    release to customers. The capitalized costs, net of accumulated
    amortization, are reflected in the “Other assets” line
    item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amortization of
    capitalized software is included in the “Cost of product
    sales and services” line item of the Consolidated Statement
    of Income.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other Assets and Liabilities

— No current
    assets other than those already disclosed on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our total current
    assets as of June 29, 2007 or as of June 30, 2006. No
    assets within the caption “Other assets” on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of total
    assets as of June 29, 2007 or as of June 30, 2006. No
    accrued liabilities or expenses within the caption “Other
    accrued items” or “Other long-term liabilities”
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheet exceeded 5 percent of our
    total current liabilities or total liabilities, respectively, as
    of June 29, 2007 or as of June 30, 2006.

Income Taxes

— We follow the liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. We record the estimated future
    tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines
    in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax
    assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary
    valuation allowances as required. We regularly review our
    deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical
    taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected
    timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and
    tax planning strategies. See

Note 22: Income Taxes

for additional information regarding income taxes.

Warranties

— On development and production
    contract sales in our Government Communications Systems and RF
    Communications segments, the value or price of our warranty is
    generally included in the contract and funded by the customer. A
    provision for warranties is built into the estimated program
    costs when determining the profit rate to accrue when applying
    the cost-to-cost percentage of completion revenue recognition
    method. Warranty costs, as incurred, are charged to the specific
    program’s cost and both revenue and cost are recognized at
    that time. Factors that affect the estimated program cost for
    warranty include terms of the contract, number of installed
    units, historical experience and management’s judgment
    regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per
    claim.

On product sales in our RF Communications, Harris Stratex
    Networks and Broadcast Communications segments, we provide for
    future warranty costs upon product delivery. The specific terms
    and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
    product sold and country in which we do business. In the case of
    products sold by us, our warranties generally start from the
    delivery date and continue as follows:

Segment

Warranty Periods

RF Communications

One to twelve years

Harris Stratex Networks

Two to three years

Broadcast Communications

One to five years

Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to
    customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting
    those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal
    warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, historical experience and
    management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of
    warranty claims and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of
    our recorded warranty liabilities every quarter and make
    adjustments to the liability as necessary.

Automation software products sold by our Broadcast
    Communications segment and network management software products
    sold by our Harris Stratex Networks segment generally carry a
    30- to

90-day

warranty from the date of customer acceptance. Our liability
    under these warranties is either to provide a corrected copy of
    any portion of the software found not to be in substantial
    compliance with the agreed upon specifications, or to provide a
    full refund.

Software license agreements and sales contracts for other
    products in our Broadcast Communications and Harris Stratex
    Networks segments generally include provisions for indemnifying
    customers against certain specified liabilities should those
    segments’ products infringe a third party’s
    intellectual property rights. Certain of our Broadcast
    Communications transmission systems customers have notified us
    of potential claims against us based on these standard
    indemnification provisions included in sales contracts between
    us and these customers. These indemnification claims arise from
    litigation brought by a third party patent licensing company
    asserting alleged technology rights against these customers. We
    are cooperating with these customers in efforts to mitigate
    their litigation exposure. To date, we have not incurred any
    material costs as a result of such indemnification and have not
    accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our
    consolidated financial statements. See

Note 10: Accrued
    Warranties

for additional information regarding warranties.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional
    currency for most international subsidiaries is the local
    currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates
    of exchange and income and expense items are



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the year.
    The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate
    component of shareholders’ equity.

Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

—
    Prior to the July 2, 2005 start of our fiscal year 2006, we
    accounted for the share-based compensation granted under our
    stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
    to Employees” (“APB 25”). In accordance with APB
    25, we used the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock
    option awards to employees and, accordingly, did not recognize
    compensation expense for our stock option awards to employees in
    our Consolidated Statement of Income, as all option exercise
    prices were 100 percent of fair market value on the date
    the options were granted. Effective at the beginning of fiscal
    year 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“Statement 123R”) for all share-based compensation
    that was not vested as of the end of fiscal year 2005. In
    accordance with Statement 123R, we measure compensation cost for
    all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at
    fair value and recognize cost over the vesting period. It is our
    policy to issue shares when options are exercised. We also
    repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive
    effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans. See

Note 14: Stock Options and Share-Based Compensation

for additional information regarding share-based
    compensation including the impact of implementing Statement 123R
    on our results of operations and cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

— Our segments have the
    following revenue recognition policies:

Government Communications Systems
    segment:

Revenue in our Government Communications
    Systems segment primarily relates to development and production
    contracts. Revenue and anticipated profits under development and
    production contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion
    basis, generally using the cost-to-cost method of accounting
    where sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs
    incurred to estimated total costs at completion. The Government
    Communications Systems segment sometimes uses the
    units-of-delivery method of accounting rather than the
    cost-to-cost method of accounting for production contracts that
    call for the delivery of larger quantities of products. Under
    the units-of-delivery method, sales and profits are recorded
    based on the ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total
    units to be delivered under the contract. Recognition of profit
    on development and production fixed-price contracts requires
    estimates of: the total contract value; the total cost at
    completion; and the measurement of progress towards completion.
    Revenue and profits on cost-reimbursable contracts are
    recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, and
    become billable to the customer, in an amount equal to the
    allowable costs plus the profit on those costs.

Contracts are combined when specific aggregation criteria stated
    in AICPA’s Statement of Position

No. 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

(“SOP 81-1”)

are met. Criteria generally include closely interrelated
    activities performed for a single customer within the same
    economic environment. Contracts generally are not segmented. If
    contracts are segmented, they meet the segmenting criteria
    stated in

SOP 81-1.

Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other
    items are included in sales only when they can be reliably
    estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties
    and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered
    in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there
    is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract
    performance. Incentive provisions, which increase earnings based
    solely on a single significant event, are generally not
    recognized until the event occurs. When adjustments in contract
    value or estimated costs are determined, any changes from prior
    estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period.
    Anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are
    charged to earnings when identified.

This segment also has revenue from product sales other than
    development and production contracts and revenue from service
    arrangements, which are recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collectibility is probable, delivery of a product has occurred,
    and title has transferred or services have been rendered.
    Further, if an arrangement other than a development and
    production contract requires the delivery or performance of
    multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale, we
    determine whether the individual elements represent
    “separate units of accounting” under the requirements
    of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

00-21,

“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”

(“EITF 00-21”).

If the separate elements meet the requirements listed in

EITF 00-21,

we recognize the revenue associated with each element separately
    and contract revenue is allocated among elements based on
    relative fair value. If the elements within a bundled sale are
    not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an
    individual element is considered not to have occurred if there
    are undelivered elements that are essential to the
    functionality. Unearned income on service contracts is amortized
    by the straight-line method over the term of the contracts.
    Also, if contractual obligations related to customer acceptance
    exist, revenue is not recognized for a product or service unless
    these obligations are satisfied.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

RF Communications segment:

Revenue in our RF
    Communications segment primarily relates to product and services
    sales. Revenue recognition from development and production
    contracts and product and services sales follows the same
    policies as stated under our Government Communications Systems
    segment’s revenue recognition policy above.

Harris Stratex Networks segment:

Revenue in
    our Harris Stratex Networks segment primarily relates to product
    and services sales. Revenue recognition from development and
    production contracts and product and services sales follows the
    same policies as stated under our Government Communications
    Systems segment’s revenue recognition policy above.

Broadcast Communications segment:

Revenue in
    our Broadcast Communications segment primarily relates to
    product and services sales and software licenses. Revenue
    recognition from development and production contracts and
    product and services sales follows the same policies as stated
    under our Government Communications Systems segment’s
    revenue recognition policy above. This segment derives a portion
    of its revenue from the licensing of software with multi-year
    maintenance arrangements. The amount of revenue allocated to
    undelivered elements under these bundled software licenses is
    based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual
    method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as
    indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as
    unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements
    is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned
    revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a
    straight-line basis over the maintenance agreement.

Other:

Royalty income is included as a
    component of “Non-operating income (loss)” on the
    Consolidated Statement of Income and is recognized on the basis
    of terms specified in contractual agreements. Shipping and
    handling fees billed to customers are classified on the
    Consolidated Statement of Income as “Revenue from product
    sales” and the associated costs are classified in
    “Cost of product sales.” Also, we record taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from
    revenues.

Retirement Benefits

— As of June 29, 2007,
    we provide retirement benefits to substantially all

U.S.-based

employees primarily through a defined contribution retirement
    plan having profit sharing, matching and savings elements.
    Contributions by us to the retirement plan are based on profits
    and employees’ savings with no other funding requirements.
    We may make additional contributions to the plan at our
    discretion. Retirement benefits also include an unfunded limited
    healthcare plan for

U.S.-based

retirees and employees on long-term disability. We accrue the
    estimated cost of these medical benefits, which are not
    material, during an employee’s active service life.

Retirement plan expense amounted to $86.0 million in fiscal
    2007, $103.9 million in fiscal 2006 and $87.0 million
    in fiscal 2005.

Minority Interest

— Minority interest
    represents the minority stockholders’ proportionate share
    of equity and net income or net loss of Harris Stratex Networks.
    As of June 29, 2007, the minority stockholders’
    proportionate share of the equity in Harris Stratex Networks of
    $326.9 million is reflected as “Minority interest in
    Harris Stratex Networks, Inc.” in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. The minority stockholders’ proportionate share of
    net loss for fiscal 2007 was $10.5 million.

Environmental Expenditures

— We capitalize
    environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
    of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
    contamination. We accrue environmental expenses resulting from
    existing conditions that relate to past operations when the
    costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

We are named as a potentially responsible party at 16 sites
    where future liabilities could exist. These sites include two
    sites owned by us, 6 sites associated with our former graphics
    or semiconductor locations and 8 treatment or disposal sites not
    owned by us that contain hazardous substances allegedly
    attributable to us from past operations. Based on an assessment
    of relevant factors, we have estimated that our discounted
    liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the
    “Superfund Act”) and other environmental statutes and
    regulations for identified sites, using an 8.25 percent discount
    rate, is approximately $5.1 million. This liability is
    accrued in the June 29, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    The expected aggregate undiscounted amount that will be incurred
    over the next 15 to 20 years (depending on the number of
    years for each site) is approximately $7.9 million. The
    expected payments for the next five years are: fiscal
    2008 — $0.8 million; fiscal 2009 —
    $1.2 million; fiscal 2010 — $0.9 million;
    fiscal 2011 — $0.9 million; fiscal
    2012 — $0.7 million; and the aggregate amount
    thereafter is approximately $3.4 million. The relevant
    factors we considered in estimating our potential liabilities
    under the Superfund Act and other environmental statutes and
    regulations



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

include cost-sharing agreements with other parties and the
    potential indemnification from successor and predecessor owners
    of these sites. We do not believe that uncertainties with
    respect to these relevant factors would materially affect our
    potential liability under the Superfund Act and other
    environmental statutes and regulations.

Financial Guarantees and Commercial
    Commitments

— Guarantees are contingent
    commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to
    a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial
    paper issuances, bond financings and similar transactions. The
    terms of the guarantees are equal to the remaining term of the
    related debt, which are limited to one year or less. The maximum
    potential amount of future payments we could be required to make
    under debt guarantees at June 29, 2007 is $0.5 million.

During the quarter ended September 29, 2006, our Broadcast
    Communications segment entered into an agreement to sell
    products and services to a customer in connection with the
    customer’s prime contract to provide 19 transmission
    stations to a state agency. Pursuant to the terms of the prime
    contract, the customer was required to post a $20 million
    bond in favor of the agency to secure the customer’s
    obligations under the prime contract. In order to facilitate the
    issuance of the bond, we entered into an agreement with the
    customer and the bond surety to provide additional indemnity to
    the surety in the event the surety incurs any loss by reason of
    executing such bond. Our indemnity obligations are supported by,
    among other things, $2 million in irrevocable standby
    letters of credit obtained by the customer in our favor; a
    guarantee from the customer, as primary guarantor, in our favor
    of up to approximately $11 million; personal guarantees
    from certain principals of the customer, as secondary
    guarantors, in our favor of up to approximately $11 million
    in the aggregate; an additional fee payable by the customer to
    us of up to $300,000; certain additional undertakings by the
    customer to us with respect to the amount of our products and
    services to be sold by us to the customer in connection with the
    customer’s prime contract with the agency; an agreement by
    the customer to use best efforts to include us in any resolution
    procedure should default be declared or a claim be made to the
    bond; and an agreement with the customer, to the extent the
    customer is able, recommending we “step into” the
    customer’s place in the event the customer is not able to
    perform under the prime contract with the agency. The bond may
    remain outstanding until February 2010. We believe that the
    technical, project and financial risks associated with our
    agreement to provide additional indemnity to the surety is
    remote and should not have a material effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

At June 29, 2007, there are no guarantees accrued for in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also hold insurance policies
    with third parties to mitigate the risk of loss on a portion of
    guarantees. We have entered into commercial commitments in the
    normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter
    of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial
    institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee
    of future performance on certain contracts to provide products
    and services to customers and to obtain insurance policies with
    our insurance carriers. At June 29, 2007, we had total
    commercial commitments, including debt and performance
    guarantees of $156.6 million.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

—
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“Statement 133”) requires us to
    recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
    fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
    depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value
    of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair
    value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through
    earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
    hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion
    of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately
    recognized in earnings.

As part of our risk management program we use a combination of
    foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts
    to hedge against risks associated with anticipated cash flows
    that are probable of occurring in the future and cash flows that
    are fixed or firmly committed. These derivatives have only
    nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase and have a high
    degree of correlation to the anticipated cash flows they are
    designated to hedge. Hedge effectiveness is determined by the
    correlation of the anticipated cash flows and the maturity dates
    of the derivatives used to hedge these cash flows. We do not
    hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
    purposes.

We account for our instruments used to hedge against the
    currency risk and market fluctuation risk associated with
    anticipated or forecasted cash flows that are probable of
    occurring in the future as cash flow hedges. In accordance with
    Statement 133, such financial instruments are marked-to-market
    using forward prices and fair value quotes with the offset to
    other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness. The
    foreign currency options and forward contracts are subsequently
    recognized as a component of “Cost of product sales”
    on the Consolidated Statement of Income when the underlying net
    cash flows are realized. Unrealized losses are recorded in
    “Other



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accrued items” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the
    offset to other comprehensive income, net of hedge
    ineffectiveness. Unrealized gains are recorded as “Other
    assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the offset
    to other comprehensive income, net of hedge ineffectiveness.

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
    by counterparties to these financial instruments, but we do not
    expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their
    obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties
    based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single
    counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market
    position with each counterparty. In the event of the termination
    of a derivative designated as a hedge, the settlement would be
    charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as a component
    of “Non-operating income (loss).”

Net Income Per Share

— Net income per share is
    based upon the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during each year. See

Note 15: Net Income
    Per Diluted Share

for additional information regarding net
    income per share.

Reclassifications

— Certain prior-year amounts
    have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements
    to conform with current-year classifications. These
    reclassifications include:

•

Reclassifying $28.1 million software capitalized under the
    provisions of

SOP 98-1

from the caption “Other assets” to the caption
    “Property, plant and equipment” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2006.

•

Reclassifying $10.5 million investment in AuthenTec from
    the caption “Other assets” to the caption
    “Marketable securities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as of June 30, 2006.

•

Reclassifying $34.2 million of long-term liabilities to the
    caption “Other long-term liabilities” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2006 made up of
    $15.8 million from the caption “Compensation and
    benefits,” $17.8 million from the caption “Other
    accrued items” and $0.6 million from the caption
    “Advance payments and unearned income.”

•

Reclassifying $13.1 million and $4.8 million
    amortization of developed technology from “Engineering,
    selling and administrative expenses” to “Cost of
    product sales and services” in our Consolidated Statement
    of Income for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.

NOTE 2:

ACCOUNTING
    CHANGES OR RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
    FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
    Awards” (“FSP 123R-3”). FSP 123R-3
    provides a simplified alternative method to calculate the
    beginning pool of excess tax benefits against which excess
    future deferred tax assets (that result when the compensation
    cost recognized for an award exceeds the ultimate tax deduction)
    could be written off under Statement 123R. The guidance in
    FSP 123R-3 was effective on November 10, 2005. We
    determined not to make the one-time election to adopt the
    alternative transition method described in FSP 123R-3. We
    have implemented the provisions of Statement 123R following the
    guidance for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits
    described in paragraph 81 of Statement 123R and the
    guidance related to reporting cash flows described in
    paragraph 68 of Statement 123R. Our determination not to
    adopt the alternative transition method described in
    FSP 123R-3 did not have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

06-3,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation)”
    (“Issue

06-3”).

The EITF reached a conclusion that the presentation of taxes
    such as sales, use, value added and excise taxes on either a
    gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from
    revenues and costs) basis is an accounting policy decision that
    should be disclosed by a company. In addition, a company should
    disclose the amounts of those taxes such as sales, use, value
    added and excise taxes that are reported on a gross basis in
    interim and annual financial statements for each period for
    which an income statement is presented if those amounts are
    significant. The provisions of Issue

06-3

are
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods that began
    after December 15, 2006. We have disclosed that we record
    taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities on a net basis. Our adoption and implementation of
    the provisions of Issue

06-3

did not
    have a material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which sets out a consistent framework
    for preparers to use to



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for
    uncertain tax positions. This interpretation of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes” uses a two-step approach wherein a tax
    benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to
    be sustained. The amount of the benefit to be recognized is the
    largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being ultimately sustained. FIN 48 also sets
    out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an
    entity’s tax reserves. We are required to adopt FIN 48
    as of June 30, 2007 (the beginning of our fiscal 2008). We
    expect that the effect of adopting FIN 48 will result in an
    immaterial adjustment to fiscal 2008 opening retained earnings
    and an immaterial impact on our financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“Statement 157”). Statement 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 applies
    under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value
    measurement in which the FASB concluded that fair value was the
    relevant measurement, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. Statement 157 will be effective for us beginning
    in fiscal 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact Statement
    157 will have on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“Statement 158”), which amends FASB
    Statements No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions;” No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
    Plans and for Termination Benefits;” No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions;” and No. 132(R),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pension and Other
    Postretirement Benefits.” Statement 158 requires an
    employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a
    defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in
    its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in
    that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
    through the comprehensive income of a business entity. Statement
    158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a
    plan as of the date of the employer’s year-end balance
    sheet, with limited exceptions. The portion of Statement 158
    that requires the recognition of overfunded or underfunded
    status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or
    liability was effective for us as of June 29, 2007. The
    incremental effects of adopting Statement 158 on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2007 were not
    material and included a $22.4 million decrease in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” The adoption
    of Statement 158 had no impact on the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. The portion of Statement 158 that requires measurement
    of the funded status of pension and postretirement plans as of
    the date of a company’s fiscal year end will be effective
    for us as of July 3, 2009. Certain of our plans currently
    have measurement dates that do not coincide with our fiscal year
    end and thus we will be required to change their measurement
    dates in fiscal 2009.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 expresses the
    SEC’s views regarding the process of quantifying
    misstatements in financial statements. The view of the SEC is
    that the effects of prior year errors in the balance sheet must
    be taken into account for the current year income statement
    financial reporting. We implemented the provisions of
    SAB 108 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and it did
    not have a material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“Statement 159”). Statement 159 allows companies to
    voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure many
    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value (the
    “fair value option”). The election is made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
    for an instrument, all unrealized gains or losses in fair value
    for that instrument shall be reported in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal
    years that begin after November 15, 2007, which for us will
    be our fiscal 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact
    Statement 159 may have on our financial position, results
    of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 3:

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

During fiscal 2007 we made the following business combinations:

•

We combined our former Microwave Communications Division with
    Stratex, a publicly-traded provider of high-speed wireless
    transmission systems, to form a new company named Harris Stratex
    Networks, Inc. The



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

combination creates a global communications solutions company
    offering end-to-end wireless transmission solutions for mobile
    and fixed-wireless service providers and private networks. Each
    share of Stratex common stock was converted into one-fourth of a
    share of Harris Stratex Networks Class A common stock. As a
    result of the transaction, 24,782,153 shares of Harris
    Stratex Networks Class A common stock were issued to the
    former holders of Stratex common stock and Stratex became a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Harris Stratex Networks. We
    contributed the assets of our Microwave Communications Division,
    including $32.1 million in cash, and, in exchange, Harris
    Stratex Networks assumed substantially all of the liabilities
    related to our Microwave Communications Division and issued
    32,913,377 shares of Harris Stratex Networks Class B
    common stock to us. As a result of these transactions, we own
    approximately 57 percent of Harris Stratex Networks’
    outstanding stock and the minority stockholders own
    approximately 43 percent of Harris Stratex Networks’
    outstanding stock. Harris Stratex Networks is a publicly-traded
    company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol
    “HSTX.” Harris Stratex Networks results of operations
    have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and
    Cash Flows since the combination date of January 26, 2007,
    with appropriate elimination of the minority interest. See
    additional information in

Note 4: Ownership in Harris
    Stratex Networks

.

The Stratex combination was accounted for as a purchase business
    combination with us considered to be the purchaser for
    accounting purposes, and resulted in a gain to us of
    approximately $163.4 million ($143.1 million
    after-tax), which relates to the deemed sale of 43 percent
    of the assets and liabilities of our Microwave Communications
    Division to the minority stockholders of Harris Stratex
    Networks. Additional details, including calculation of the
    purchase price, identifiable intangible assets and
    Stratex’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition
    date, are provided in the table and notes below.

•

Multimax Incorporated (“Multimax”), a privately-held
    provider of information technology and communications services
    for the U.S. Government. The acquisition of Multimax
    significantly expands our information technical services
    business — providing greater scale, a broader customer
    base and new growth opportunities through key positions on
    Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts. We purchased Multimax for
    $402 million in cash. Additional details, including
    calculation of the purchase price, identifiable intangible
    assets and Multimax’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the
    acquisition date, are provided in the table and notes below.

During fiscal 2006 we made the following business combinations:

•

Leitch Technology Corporation (“Leitch”), a
    publicly-held provider of high-performance video systems for the
    television broadcast industry. Additional details, including
    calculation of the purchase price, identifiable intangible
    assets and Leitch’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the
    acquisition date, are provided in the table and notes below.

•

Optimal Solutions, Inc. (“OSi”), a privately-held
    provider of air-time sales, traffic and billing software systems
    to over 350 call-letter broadcast stations in North America, for
    a total purchase price of $31.3 million. We recorded
    $10.7 million of identifiable intangible assets that are
    being amortized over a weighted average life of 8.0 years.

•

Aastra Digital Video, a business unit of Aastra Technologies
    Limited. Aastra Digital Video develops and markets video
    networking, encoding, decoding and multiplexing technologies
    used by television broadcasters, telecommunications providers
    and satellite networks, for a total purchase price of
    $34.8 million. We recorded $8.6 million of
    identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a
    weighted average life of 6.9 years.

During fiscal 2005 we made the following business combinations:

•

The Orkand Corporation (“Orkand”), a privately-held

In connection with the combination with Stratex, we allocated
    $15.3 million of the purchase price to in-process research
    and development projects. These allocations represent the
    estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related
    to the incomplete projects. At the date of the combination, the
    development of these projects had not yet reached technological
    feasibility and the in-process research and development had no
    alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
    as a charge to earnings and are included in engineering, selling
    and administrative expenses. In making these purchase price
    allocations we relied on present value calculations of income,
    an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and
    an assessment of overall contribution and project risk. The
    value assigned to the purchased in-process research and
    development was determined by estimating the costs to develop
    the purchased in-process research and development into
    commercially viable products and discounting the net cash flows
    to their present value using a discount rate of 19 percent.
    The Stratex projects were for the development of the next
    generation of the Eclipse product (“Next Generation
    Eclipse”). The Next Generation Eclipse product is expected
    to incorporate significant modifications to address
    carrier-grade Ethernet functionality. The functionality in the
    planned product is expected to represent the first significant
    jump related to capacity and capability associated with packet
    switching. As of the valuation date, this project was
    approximately 50 percent complete with initial product release
    expected in late calendar 2007 and had remaining costs until
    completion of approximately $3.4 million.

All of these business combinations have been accounted for under
    the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, their
    results of operations have been included in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income and Cash Flows since their acquisition and
    combination dates. The purchase prices of the Leitch, OSi and
    Aastra Digital Video acquisitions give effect to post-closing
    adjustments while the purchase prices of the Stratex and
    Multimax acquisitions or combinations remain subject to
    post-closing adjustments. The consideration given to the former
    shareholders and option holders of Stratex was newly issued
    shares of Harris Stratex Networks. The cash consideration given
    to the former shareholders and option holders of Multimax was
    funded using $400.0 million of commercial paper backed by
    our credit facility. The purchase price allocation is
    preliminary for all of these acquisitions with respect to tax
    assets and liabilities and is preliminary for other assets and
    liabilities for the Stratex combination and Multimax
    acquisition. The goodwill resulting from all these acquisitions
    and combinations was associated primarily with the acquired
    companies’ market presence and leading positions, growth
    opportunities in the markets in which the acquired companies
    operated, and experienced work forces and established operating
    infrastructures. The goodwill resulting from the Stratex
    combination and the Multimax, Leitch and OSi acquisitions is not
    deductible for tax purposes while the goodwill related to the
    Aastra Digital Video acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
    The write-offs of in-process research and development noted in
    the above table were included in “Engineering, selling and
    administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. We obtained the assistance of independent valuation
    specialists to assist us in determining the allocation of the
    purchase price for these acquisitions and combination.

There is a $9.0 million additional payment due to the
    former owners of OSi based on certain financial performance
    criteria that were met in fiscal 2007. Accordingly, we increased
    goodwill and recorded a liability in

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fiscal 2007. This amount will be paid to the former owners over
    the next three years. The timing of the actual payment is
    dependent on certain financial measures.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
    unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the business
    combination with Stratex and acquisition of Multimax had been
    completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006,
    after including the impact of adjustments such as amortization
    of intangible assets, interest expense on related borrowings,
    and the related income tax effects. This pro forma presentation
    does not include any impact of transaction synergies.

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of our

    include after-tax charges of $3.2 million of integration
    costs associated with the combination. The Multimax revenue and
    net income are positively impacted by $37.0 million and
    $24.9 million, for fiscal 2007, and $65.8 million and
    $44.1 million, for fiscal 2006, respectively, due to higher
    income recorded based on a contract with its largest customer
    for which the prices were reduced effective January 1, 2007.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents
    unaudited consolidated results of operations as if the
    acquisition of Leitch had been completed as of the beginning of

NOTE 4:

OWNERSHIP
    IN HARRIS STRATEX NETWORKS

Harris Stratex Networks is authorized to issue and has issued
    both Class A common stock and Class B common stock. We
    own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Class B common
    stock. The Class B common stock has the same rights and
    privileges as, and ranks equally and shares ratably with, the
    Class A common stock, and otherwise is substantially
    similar to the Class A common stock, except that holders of
    shares of Class B common stock have certain additional
    rights, several of which are generally described below.

Holders of Class B common stock have the right to vote
    separately as a class to elect a number of Harris Stratex
    Networks directors (the “Class B Directors”)
    equal to such holders’ proportionate ownership of the total
    voting power of the outstanding Harris Stratex Networks common
    stock (and to remove and replace such Class B Directors) so
    long as such holders’ total voting power is equal to or
    greater than 10 percent. Also, subject to limited



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exceptions, holders of Class B common stock have a
    preemptive right to preserve their proportionate interest in
    Harris Stratex Networks, but only when the holders of
    Class B common stock hold a majority of the total number of
    votes entitled to be cast generally in an election of the
    directors of Harris Stratex Networks (other than an election of
    the Class B Directors).

We have agreed that until January 26, 2009 we will not
    acquire or dispose of any of our voting securities in Harris
    Stratex Networks, unless (i) pursuant to our preemptive
    right described above, (ii) approved in advance by a
    majority of the Harris Stratex Networks directors who are not
    Class B directors (the “Class A Directors”),
    or (iii) as a result of actions taken by Harris Stratex
    Networks that do not increase or decrease our percentage of
    total voting power which we and our affiliates are entitled to
    cast in respect of all classes of capital stock or securities of
    Harris Stratex Networks then outstanding and entitled to vote
    generally in the election of Class A Directors (including
    the holders of Class B common stock) beneficially owned by
    us. We have also agreed that from January 26, 2009 to
    January 26, 2011, we will not (1) beneficially own
    more than 80 percent of the voting power of Harris Stratex
    Networks without the prior approval of a majority of the
    Class A Directors or (2) transfer all or a portion of
    our interest in Harris Stratex Networks to a person if,
    following such transfer, that person would be entitled to cast a
    majority of the outstanding votes in an election of the
    directors of Harris Stratex Networks (other than an election of
    the Class B Directors) unless a majority of the
    Class A Directors approves such transfer in advance or the
    person purchasing our interest in Harris Stratex Networks offers
    to acquire all the outstanding voting securities of Harris
    Stratex Networks at the same price and on the same terms as
    apply to the transfer from us. Shares of Class A common
    stock currently are listed for trading on NASDAQ Global Market
    under the symbol “HSTX,” while shares of Class B
    common stock currently are not listed for trading on any
    exchange or quotation system and are not expected to be so
    listed at any time in the foreseeable future.

Harris
    Stratex Networks Segment

During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Harris Stratex
    Networks segment successfully released additional frequencies of
    the
    TRuepoint

tm

product family, essentially completing all frequencies intended
    to be offered in the low- and mid-capacity microwave radio
    market segments. In light of these releases and the market
    acceptance of previously released frequencies as demonstrated by

tm

product sales over the preceding three quarters,

product families (the product families the

tm

product family, a product line that shared manufacturing
    facilities with the
    MicroStar

tm

and the
    Galaxy

tm

product lines in Montreal, Canada. The
    Clearburst

tm

product family was discontinued because significant costs would
    have to be incurred to move production of these products from
    Montreal, Canada to San Antonio, Texas, which is the
    segment’s primary manufacturing location, where the
    TRuepoint

tm

product line is produced. In November 2005, letters were sent to
    Microstar

tm

,
    Galaxy

tm

and
    Clearburst

tm

customers informing them of the MD announcement.

We estimated expected demand for these discontinued products
    based on: (1) responses to the letters noted above, and
    (2) a percentage of the installed product base, using
    previous product MD history as a basis for this estimate. In
    addition, the customer service inventory of these discontinued
    products was reviewed and quantities required to support
    existing warranty obligations and contractual obligations were
    quantified. These analyses identified inventory held in multiple
    locations including Montreal, Canada; Redwood Shores,
    California; San Antonio, Texas; Paris, France; Mexico City,
    Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Shenzhen, China. As a result of
    these analyses, approximately $34 million of inventory was
    written down during fiscal 2006.

Broadcast
    Communications Segment

During the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006, the
    Broadcast Communications segment took cost-reduction actions to
    address ongoing weakness in our international broadcast
    transmission markets and to further improve the segment’s
    profitability. These actions included closing our Huntingdon,
    United Kingdom facility; relocating manufacturing of
    European-standard transmission products to our Quincy, Illinois
    facility; reducing our infrastructure in Austria; outsourcing
    manufacturing of radio consoles and related products from our
    Mason, Ohio facility; and headcount reductions from further
    integration within our software systems business. In light of
    these actions we identified products that we would no longer
    sell to customers because the cost to move the production of
    these products from our Huntingdon, United Kingdom facility to
    our Quincy, Illinois facility and costs to outsource the
    manufacturing products from our Mason, Ohio facility to a third
    party or move this manufacturing to another Harris facility
    exceeded the future benefits expected to result from such
    actions. As a result, we announced in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2006 to our customers, dealers and suppliers that we
    would be discontinuing the production of these products. An
    analysis of inventory was made as part of the actions noted
    above and a provision was made for inventory levels in excess of
    estimated demand for all exited products. The estimate of demand
    took the following into consideration: (1) responses to the
    letters sent to the customers, (2) previous product exit
    experience for the Broadcast Communications segment, and
    (3) future customer service requirements including existing
    warranty obligations and contractual obligations. As a result of
    these analyses, $12 million of inventory was written down
    during fiscal 2006.

NOTE 11:

CREDIT
    ARRANGEMENTS

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year senior
    unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit
    Agreement provides for the extension of credit to us in the form
    of revolving loans and letters of credit issuances at any time
    and from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement,
    in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
    exceed $500 million (we may request an increase not to
    exceed $250 million). The Credit Agreement may be used for
    working capital and other general corporate purposes and to
    support any commercial paper that we may issue. At our election,
    borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest either
    at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate. The base
    rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the Federal
    funds rate plus 0.50 percent or SunTrust Bank’s
    publicly announced prime lending rate. The Credit Agreement
    provides that the interest rate margin over LIBOR, initially set
    at 0.50 percent, will increase or decrease within certain
    limits based on changes in the ratings of our senior, unsecured
    long-term debt securities. We are also permitted to request
    borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set
    pursuant to competitive bid procedures or directly negotiated

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including
    covenants limiting: liens on our assets; certain mergers,
    consolidations or sales of assets; certain sale and leaseback
    transactions; certain vendor financing investments; and the use
    of proceeds for hostile acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also
    prohibits our consolidated ratio of total indebtedness to total
    capital from being greater than 0.60 to 1.00 and prohibits our
    consolidated ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net interest expense
    from being less than 3.00 to 1.00 for any rolling four-quarter
    period. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default,
    including: payment defaults; failure to perform or observe terms
    and covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or
    warranties; default under other indebtedness with a principal
    amount in excess of $50 million; the occurrence of one or
    more judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of
    $50 million that remain unsatisfied; incurrence of certain
    ERISA liabilities in excess of $50 million; failure to pay
    debts as they come due, or our bankruptcy; or a change of
    control, including if a person or group becomes the beneficial
    owner of 25 percent or more of our voting stock. If an
    event of default occurs, the lenders may, among other things,
    terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding
    borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be
    immediately due and payable. All amounts borrowed or outstanding
    under the Credit Agreement are due and mature on March 31,
    2010, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at
    our

    2007, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

We have a universal shelf registration statement related to the
    potential future issuance of an indeterminate amount of
    securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common
    stock, fractional interests in preferred stock represented by
    depository shares and warrants to purchase debt securities,
    preferred stock or common stock.

We have uncommitted short-term lines of credit aggregating
    $14.7 million from various international banks,
    $13.3 million of which was available on June 29, 2007.
    These lines provide for borrowings at various interest rates,
    typically may be terminated upon notice, may be used on such
    terms as mutually agreed to by the banks and us, and are
    reviewed annually for renewal or modification. These lines do
    not require compensating balances.

We have a short-term commercial paper program in place, which we
    may utilize to satisfy short-term cash requirements. We had
    $400.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the
    commercial paper program at June 29, 2007, which was backed
    by the Credit Agreement.

    into consideration the possibility that the debt holders will
    exercise put options for our 6.35% Debentures in February
    2008 and our 3.5% Convertible Debentures in August 2007.
    All of our outstanding long-term debt is unsubordinated and
    unsecured with equal ranking, except that the debt issued by
    Stratex described below is debt of Harris Stratex Networks

On September 20, 2005, we completed the issuance of
    $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes
    due October 1, 2015. We may redeem the notes in whole, or
    in part, at any time at the “make-whole” redemption
    price. The “make-whole” redemption price is equal to
    the greater of 100 percent of the principal amount of the
    notes being redeemed or the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest
    (other than interest accruing to the date of redemption) on the
    notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a
    semi-annual basis (assuming a

360-day

    consisting of twelve

    Income.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022.
    These debentures were convertible into shares of our common
    stock at a conversion price of $22.625 during any calendar
    quarter if the closing price of our common stock, for at least
    20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
    on the last trading day of the prior calendar quarter, was more
    than $24.8875, and in certain other circumstances. On
    July 12, 2007, we initiated the steps necessary to redeem
    these debentures on August 20, 2007. However, prior to the
    date set for redemption, all of the debentures were converted by
    the holders into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate
    of 44.2404 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal
    amount of debentures, with the exception of debentures in the
    principal amount of $3,000. This resulted in the issuance by us
    of 6,594,146 shares of common stock during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 in respect of the debentures converted.
    On August 20, 2007, we redeemed the remaining debentures in
    the principal amount of $3,000. Accordingly, no debentures
    remain outstanding as of August 20, 2007. We incurred
    $4.8 million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance
    of the convertible debentures, which costs are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over a five-year period and reflected
    as a portion of interest expense in the Consolidated Statement
    of Income. See additional information in

Note 25: Subsequent
    Event.

In February 1998, we completed the issuance of $150 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Debentures due
    February 1, 2028. We may redeem the debentures in whole, or
    in part, at any time after February 2, 2008 at a
    pre-determined redemption price. Holders may require us to repay
    all or a portion of the debentures on February 1, 2008 at
    100 percent of the principal amount of the debentures being
    redeemed plus accrued interest.

In January 1996, we completed the issuance of $100 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7% Debentures due
    January 15, 2026. These debentures are not redeemable prior
    to maturity.

Prior to the combination with Stratex, Stratex was a party to a
    credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, and following the
    combination, Stratex (now named “Harris Stratex Networks
    Operating Corporation” and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Harris Stratex Networks), remains a party to the credit facility
    with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility”). Harris and its subsidiaries (other than
    Harris Stratex Networks Operating Corporation) are not parties
    to the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility and are not
    obligated under, or guarantors of, the Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility. Indebtedness under the Harris Stratex Networks
    Credit Facility is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as a result of the consolidation in the consolidated financial
    statements of the financial results of Harris Stratex Networks.
    The Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility allows for revolving
    credit borrowings of up to $50 million, with available
    credit defined as $50 million less the outstanding balance
    of the term loan portion and any usage under the revolving
    credit portion. As of June 29, 2007, the balance of the
    term loan portion of the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility
    was $19.5 million (of which $10.7 million is recorded
    in the current portion of long-term debt) and there was
    $6.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit,
    which are defined as usage under the revolving credit portion of
    the Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility. Term Loan A of the
    Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility requires monthly
    principal payments by Harris Stratex Networks Operating
    Corporation of $0.5 million plus interest at a fixed rate
    of 6.38% through May 2008. Term Loan B of the Harris Stratex
    Networks Credit Facility requires monthly principal payments by
    Harris Stratex Networks Operating Corporation of
    $0.4 million plus interest at a fixed rate of 7.25% through
    March 2010. The Harris Stratex Networks Credit Facility
    agreement contains a minimum tangible net worth covenant and a
    liquidity ratio covenant. At June 29, 2007, Harris Stratex
    Networks Operating Corporation was in compliance with these
    financial covenants.

STOCK
    OPTIONS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of June 29, 2007, we had three shareholder-approved
    stock incentive plans for employees under which options or other
    share-based compensation were outstanding, and we had the
    following types of share-based awards outstanding under these
    plans: stock options, performance share awards, performance
    share unit awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock
    unit awards. These plans include former Harris employees who are
    now employed with Harris Stratex Networks and who had options or
    awards outstanding at the date of the combination (“Harris
    Plans”). Additionally, Harris Stratex Networks has a
    stock-based compensation plan that provides for stock options,
    performance share awards and restricted share awards based on
    Harris Stratex Networks Class A Common Stock. Harris
    Stratex Networks also assumed all of the former Stratex
    outstanding stock options as of January 26, 2007, as part
    of the combination with Stratex (“Harris Stratex Networks
    Plans”). We believe that such awards more closely

align the interests of our employees with those of our
    shareholders. Certain share-based awards provide for accelerated
    vesting if there is a change in control (as defined under our
    stock incentive plans).

Stock
    Options

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under Harris shareholder-approved stock incentive
    plans. Option exercise prices are 100 percent of fair
    market value on the date the options are granted. Options may be
    exercised for a period set at the time of grant, which generally
    ranges from seven to ten years after the date of grant, and they
    generally become exercisable in installments, which are
    typically 50 percent one year from the grant date,
    25 percent two years from the grant date and
    25 percent three years from the grant date. A significant
    number of options granted by us in fiscal 2005 and 2006 are
    subject to a vesting schedule in which they are 50 percent
    exercisable prior to the end of such fiscal year, a period of
    approximately 10 months from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which
    uses assumptions noted in the following table. We obtained an
    independent valuation to assist us in determining market-based
    assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted.
    Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded
    options on Harris stock, historical volatility of Harris stock
    price over the last ten years and other factors. The expected
    term of the options is based on historical observations of
    Harris stock over the past ten years, considering average years
    to exercise for all options exercised, average years to
    cancellation for all options cancelled and average years
    remaining for outstanding options, which is calculated based on
    the weighted-average vesting period plus the weighted-average of
    the difference between the vesting period and average years to
    exercise and cancellation. The risk-free rate for periods within
    the contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury curve in effect at the time of grant.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units that have been granted to employees
    under Harris stock incentive plans. The restricted stock and
    restricted stock units are not transferable until vested and the
    restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment
    over a specified time period.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant is based on the
    closing price of Harris stock on the date of grant and is
    amortized to compensation expense over its vesting period. At
    June 29, 2007, there were 428,611 shares of restricted
    stock outstanding.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    June 29, 2007, we had 61,950 restricted stock units

    This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 2.2 years. The weighted-average grant date price
    per share of restricted stock and per unit of restricted stock
    units granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $45.92,
    $39.45 and $28.24, respectively. The total fair value of
    restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $1.6 million,
    $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

Performance
    Share Awards

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares and performance share units that have been granted to
    employees under Harris stock incentive plans. Generally,
    performance share and performance share unit awards are subject
    to performance criteria such as meeting predetermined earnings
    and return on invested capital targets for a three-year plan
    period. These awards also generally vest at the expiration of
    the same three-year period. The final determination of the
    number of shares to be issued in respect of an award is
    determined by Harris’ Board of Directors or a committee of
    Harris’ Board of Directors.

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of Harris stock on the date of grant and is amortized to
    compensation expense over its vesting period, if achievement of
    the performance measures is considered probable. At
    June 29, 2007, there were 664,726 performance shares
    outstanding.

The fair value of each performance share unit, which can be
    distributed in cash or shares, is equal to the most probable
    estimate of intrinsic value at the time of distribution and is
    amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. At
    June 29, 2007, there were 31,602 performance share units
    outstanding.

Under Harris U.S. retirement plans, most U.S.-based employees
    may select an option to invest in Harris’ common stock at
    70 percent of current market value limited to the lesser of
    (a) one percent of their compensation and
    (b) 20 percent of a participant’s total
    contribution to the plan, which is matched by us. The discount
    from fair market value on common stock purchased by employees
    under the domestic retirement plans is charged to compensation
    expense in the period of the related purchase. Starting in
    fiscal 2008, we will no longer provide a discount to invest in
    Harris’ common stock.

Shares of Harris Stratex Networks common stock remaining
    available for future issuance under Harris Stratex Networks
    Plans totaled 4,393,278 as of June 29, 2007.

The Harris Stratex Networks stock incentive plan provides for
    the issuance of share-based awards in the form of stock options,
    performance share awards and restricted stock. The initial grant
    of awards under this plan was made on February 28, 2007.
    Under this initial grant, Harris Stratex Networks issued 292,400
    stock options, 138,752 restricted shares and 141,200 performance
    shares. Harris Stratex Networks also made a grant on
    June 12, 2007 issuing 19,800 stock options, 4,970
    restricted shares and 9,600 performance shares.

Upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock
    awards, or vesting of performance share awards, Harris Stratex
    Networks issues new shares of Harris Stratex Networks
    Class A common stock. Currently, Harris Stratex Networks
    does not anticipate repurchasing shares to provide a source of
    shares for Harris Stratex Networks awards of share-based
    compensation.

Stock
    Options Awarded — 2007 Stock Equity Plan

The following information relates to stock options that have
    been granted under the Harris Stratex Networks stock incentive
    plan. Option exercise prices are equal to the fair market value
    on the date the options are granted using Harris Stratex
    Networks closing stock price. Options may be exercised for a
    period set at the time of grant, generally 7 years after
    the date of grant, and they generally vest in installments of
    50 percent one year from the grant date, 25 percent
    two years from the grant date and 25 percent three years
    from the grant date.

The fair value of each option award under Harris Stratex
    Networks stock equity plan was estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model using the
    assumptions set forth in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on implied volatility from a group of peer
    companies developed with the assistance of an independent
    valuation firm using a five-year look-back period. The expected
    term of the options is based on the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

safe harbor provision as described in the SEC’s Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The risk-free rate for
    the expected term of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Statement 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
    of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
    actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Forfeitures
    were estimated based on the historical experience at Stratex for
    those options assumed and at Harris for employees that were
    formerly employed at our Microwave Communications Division. For
    fiscal 2007 grants, we estimated the forfeiture rate based on
    the grantee population which is only at a director level and
    above which we expect to be five percent annually. We expect
    forfeitures to be 8 percent annually for the Stratex
    options assumed by Harris Stratex Networks. Stock-based
    compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures
    for fiscal 2007 such that compensation expense was recorded only
    for those stock-based awards that are expected to vest.

    the fair value of Harris Stratex Networks fiscal 2007 stock
    option grants is as follows:

Restricted
    Stock Awards — 2007 Stock Equity Plan

The following information relates to awards of restricted stock
    that were granted on February 28, 2007 and June 12,
    2007 to employees and outside directors under Harris Stratex
    Networks stock incentive plan. The restricted stock is not
    transferable until vested and the restrictions lapse upon the
    achievement of continued employment or service as a director
    over a specified time period. Restricted stock issued to
    employees cliff vests 3 years after grant date. Restricted
    stock issued to directors generally vests in quarterly
    increments through 1 year after grant date. The fair value
    of each restricted stock grant is based on the closing price of
    Harris Stratex Networks Class A common stock on the date of
    grant and is amortized to compensation expense over its vesting
    period.

Performance
    Share Awards — 2007 Stock Equity Plan

The following information relates to awards of performance
    shares that have been granted to employees on February 28,
    2007 and June 12, 2007 under the Harris Stratex Networks
    stock incentive plan. Vesting of performance share awards is
    subject to performance criteria including meeting revenue and
    operating income targets for a

29-month

plan period ending June 30, 2009 and continued employment
    at the end of that period. The final determination of the number
    of shares to be issued in respect of an award is determined by
    the Harris Stratex Networks Board of Directors or a committee of
    its Board.

The fair value of each performance share is based on the closing
    price of Harris Stratex Networks Class A common stock on
    the date of grant and is amortized to compensation expense over
    its vesting period, if achievement of the performance measures
    is considered probable.

In fiscal 2003, we issued $150 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022.
    Holders of the debentures have the right to convert each of
    their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the
    stated maturity. After giving effect to the adjustment in
    connection with our March 2005 stock split, a holder will
    receive 44.2404 shares of our common stock for each $1,000
    of debentures surrendered for conversion. This represents a
    conversion price of $22.625 per share of our common stock.

We have assessed whether the embedded conversion feature within
    our 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022 should be
    bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a
    derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in
    earnings under paragraph 12 of Statement 133. Based on our
    assessment, we have determined that the conversion feature is
    not required to be bifurcated under the provisions of Statement
    133; EITF Issue

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock”; FASB Statement No. 150, “Accounting for

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of calculating net income per diluted share, the
    numerator has not been adjusted to consider the effect of
    potentially dilutive securities of Harris Stratex Networks
    because the effect would have been antidilutive due to the net
    loss incurred by Harris Stratex Networks.

Potential dilutive common shares consist primarily of employee
    stock options. Employee stock options to purchase approximately
    zero, 20,800, and 141,898 shares at the end of fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, were outstanding, but were not
    included in the computation of net income per diluted common
    share because the effect would have been antidilutive as the
    options’ exercise prices exceeded the average market price.

NOTE 16:

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Company-sponsored research and product development costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs were $234.6 million in
    fiscal 2007, $197.8 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $146.2 million in fiscal 2005.

Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred
    pursuant to contractual arrangements and are accounted for
    principally by the percentage-of-completion method.
    Customer-sponsored research and development costs incurred under
    U.S. Government-sponsored contracts require us to provide a
    product or service meeting certain defined performance or other
    specifications (such as designs). Customer-sponsored research
    and development was $689.0 million in fiscal 2007,
    $626.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $733.0 million in
    fiscal 2005. Customer-sponsored research and development is
    included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services.

NOTE 17:

INTEREST
    EXPENSE

Total interest expense was $41.1 million in fiscal 2007,
    $36.5 million in fiscal 2006 and $24.0 million in
    fiscal 2005. Interest attributable to funds used to finance
    major long-term projects can be capitalized as an additional
    cost of the related asset. No interest was capitalized in fiscal
    2007, 2006 or 2005. Interest paid was $39.6 million in
    fiscal 2007, $31.8 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $23.2 million in fiscal 2005.

NOTE 18:

LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

We account for leases in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases” and
    other related authoritative guidance. Total rental expense
    amounted to $33.3 million in fiscal 2007,
    $30.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $27.0 million in
    fiscal 2005. Future minimum rental commitments under leases with
    an initial lease term in excess of one year, primarily for land
    and buildings, amounted to approximately $101.3 million at
    June 29, 2007. These commitments for the years following
    fiscal 2007 and, in total, thereafter are: fiscal
    2008 — $33.2 million; fiscal 2009 —
    $25.6 million; fiscal 2010 — $19.0 million;
    fiscal 2011 — $9.5 million; fiscal
    2012 — $5.1 million; and $8.9 million
    thereafter. These commitments do not contain any material rent
    escalations, rent holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions,
    leasehold improvement incentives or unusual provisions or
    conditions. We do not consider any of these individual leases
    material to our operations. Leasehold improvements made either
    at the inception of the lease or during the lease term are
    amortized over the current lease term, or estimated life, if
    shorter.

NOTE 19:

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

We use foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both
    balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency
    commitments. Generally, these foreign exchange contracts offset
    foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments
    from suppliers, accounts receivable from and future committed
    sales to customers, and intercompany loans. We believe the use
    of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the
    risks that arise from doing business in international markets.
    At June 29, 2007, we had open foreign exchange contracts
    with a notional amount of $107.2 million, of which
    $29.8 million were classified as cash flow hedges,
    $40.0 million were classified as fair value hedges and
    $37.4 million were not designated hedges under the
    provisions of Statement 133. This compares to total foreign
    exchange contracts with a notional amount of $45.7 million
    as of June 30, 2006, of which $15.7 million were
    classified as cash flow hedges and $30.0 million were
    classified as fair value hedges. At June 29, 2007, contract
    expiration dates range from less than one month to
    18 months with a weighted average contract life of
    2 months.

More specifically, the foreign exchange contracts classified as
    cash flow hedges are primarily being used to hedge currency
    exposures from cash flows anticipated in our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment related to customer orders denominated in
    non-functional currencies that are currently in backlog and in
    our RF Communications segment related to programs in the U.K.
    and Canada and payments to a vendor in the U.K. that is
    supporting one of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our government contracts in our Government Communications
    Systems segment. We have hedged the forecasted cash flows
    related to payments made to our U.S. operations to maintain
    our anticipated profit margins. We also have hedged
    U.S. dollar payments to suppliers to maintain our
    anticipated profit margins in our international operations. As
    of June 29, 2007, we estimated that a pre-tax loss of
    $0.2 million would be reclassified into net income from
    comprehensive income within the next 18 months related to
    these cash flow hedges.

The net gain included in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005 representing the amount of fair value and cash flow
    hedges’ ineffectiveness was not material. Amounts
    recognized in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005
    related to the component of the derivative instruments’
    gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
    were also not material. In addition, no amounts were recognized
    in our net income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 related to
    hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value
    hedges. All of these derivatives were recorded at their fair
    value on the balance sheet in accordance with Statement 133.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    $374.1 million of undistributed earnings of international
    subsidiaries because of our intention to reinvest these earnings
    indefinitely. The determination of unrecognized deferred
    U.S. tax liability for the undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries is not practicable. We have not
    recognized a deferred tax liability for the difference between
    the book basis and the tax basis of our investment in the stock
    of our domestic subsidiaries, related primarily to unremitted
    earnings of subsidiaries, because we do not expect this basis
    difference to become subject to tax at the parent level. We
    believe we can implement certain tax strategies to recover our
    investment in our domestic subsidiaries tax-free. Tax loss and
    credit carryforwards as of June 29, 2007 have expiration
    dates ranging between one year and no expiration in certain
    instances. The amount of domestic, international, and state and
    local tax loss carryforwards as of June 29, 2007 were
    $144.3 million, $235.0 million and $43.7 million,
    respectively. The provision for income taxes includes benefits
    attributable to the utilization of certain state net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards of zero in fiscal 2007,
    $6.5 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal
    2005. Pre-tax income (loss) of international subsidiaries was
    $37.7 million in fiscal 2007, $(9.9) million in fiscal
    2006 and $17.9 million in fiscal 2005. Income taxes paid
    were $160.8 million in fiscal 2007, $90.6 million in
    fiscal 2006 and $43.6 million in fiscal 2005. The valuation
    allowance increased $97.5 million from $70.4 million
    at the end of fiscal 2006 to $167.9 million at the end of
    fiscal 2007 primarily because we recorded a valuation allowance
    under purchase accounting on $94.0 million of acquired deferred
    tax assets in the Stratex Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the
    acquisition date. $114.9 million of the $167.9 million
    valuation allowance as of June 29, 2007, is attributable to
    acquired deferred tax assets, any realization of which will be
    reflected as a change in goodwill. The valuation allowance has
    been established for financial reporting purposes, to offset
    certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets due to
    uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them in the future.

NOTE 23:

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

We are structured primarily around the markets we serve and in
    fiscal 2007, we operated in four business segments —
    Government Communications Systems, RF Communications, Harris
    Stratex Networks and Broadcast Communications. Our Government
    Communications Systems segment engages in advanced research and
    develops, designs, produces and services advanced communication
    and information processing systems, primarily for the Department
    of Defense (“DoD”) and various other agencies of the
    U.S. Government. Our RF Communications segment performs
    advanced research and develops, designs, manufactures, sells and
    services secure tactical radio products, primarily for the DoD
    and various international defense agencies. Our Harris Stratex
    Networks segment designs, manufactures, sells and services
    microwave radio products and develops, designs, produces, sells
    and services network management systems, primarily for cellular
    network providers and private network operators. Our Broadcast
    Communications segment designs, manufactures, sells and services
    television and radio transmission products; high-performance
    video systems and products; software solutions related to
    automation, asset management control and workflow; and broadcast
    networking systems and products, primarily for radio and
    television broadcasters as well as governmental agencies. Within
    each of our business segments there are multiple program

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

areas and product lines that logically aggregate into our four
    business segments described above. None of these program areas
    or product lines warrant disclosure as a separate business
    segment.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in

Note 1: Significant Accounting
    Policies

. We evaluate each segment’s performance based
    on its “operating income (loss),” which we define as
    profit or loss from operations before income taxes excluding
    interest income and expense, equity income and gains or losses
    from securities and other investments. Intersegment sales among
    our Government Communications Systems, RF Communications and
    Broadcast Communications segments are transferred at cost to the
    buying segment and the sourcing segment recognizes a normal
    profit that is eliminated. Intersegment sales between our Harris
    Stratex Networks segment and any of our Government
    Communications Systems, RF Communications and Broadcast
    Communications segments are recorded as arms length
    transactions. The “Corporate eliminations” line item
    in the tables below represents the elimination of intersegment
    sales and their related profits. “Headquarters
    expense” represents the portion of corporate expenses not
    allocated to the business segments.

Our products and systems are produced principally in the United
    States with international revenue derived primarily from
    exports. No revenue earned from any individual foreign country
    exceeded 3 percent of our total revenue during fiscal 2007,
    2006 or 2005.

Sales made to the U.S. Government by all segments
    (primarily our Government Communications Systems segment and our
    RF Communications segment) as a percentage of total revenue were
    65.9 percent in fiscal 2007, 66.2 percent in fiscal
    2006 and 65.7 percent in fiscal 2005. Revenue from services
    in fiscal 2007 was 34.9 percent, 4.9 percent,
    19.1 percent and 14.9 percent of total revenue in our
    Government Communications Systems, RF Communications, Harris
    Stratex Networks and Broadcast Communications segments,
    respectively.

NOTE 24:

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, as a normal incident of the nature and kind
    of businesses in which we are engaged, various claims or charges
    are asserted and litigation commenced against us arising from or
    related to: product liability; personal injury; patents,
    trademarks or trade secrets; labor and employee disputes;
    commercial or contractual disputes; the sale or use of products
    containing asbestos; breach of warranty; or environmental
    matters. Claimed amounts may be substantial but may not bear any
    reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent
    of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We have recorded
    accruals for losses related to those matters that we consider to
    be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain
    contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and
    legal costs are generally expensed when incurred. While it is
    not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with
    certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
    disposed or decided unfavorably to us, based upon available
    information, in the opinion of management, settlements and final
    judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being
    rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at
    June 29, 2007 are reserved for, covered by insurance or
    would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 25:

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

On July 12, 2007, we notified The Bank of New York, as
    trustee, that we would redeem all of our outstanding
    3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022 in accordance with the
    terms of the Indenture dated as of August 26, 2002 between
    Harris and the trustee. The debentures would have been redeemed
    for cash on August 20, 2007, at a redemption price of
    100 percent of the principal amount of the debentures, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
    redemption date. However, prior to the date set for redemption,
    all of the debentures were converted by the holders into shares
    of our common stock at a conversion rate of 44.2404 shares
    of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures,
    with the exception of debentures in the principal amount of
    $3,000. This resulted in the issuance by us of
    6,594,146 shares of common stock in respect of the
    debentures converted. On August 20, 2007, we redeemed the
    remaining debentures in the principal amount of $3,000.
    Accordingly, no debentures remain outstanding as of
    August 20, 2007.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
    procedures:

We maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
    Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
    Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness
    of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including
    the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
    overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
    effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
    reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and
    management necessarily is required to use its judgment in
    evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Also, we have investments in certain
    unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these
    entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those
    entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those
    we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. As
    required by

Rule 13a-15

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of fiscal 2007 we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This
    evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. During fiscal 2007, we
    devoted significant effort to comply with the rules on internal
    control over financial reporting issued pursuant to
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This effort
    expanded upon our long-standing practice of acknowledging
    management’s responsibility for the establishment and
    effective operation of internal control through performing
    self-assessment and monitoring procedures. Based upon this work
    and other evaluation procedures, our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has
    concluded that as of the end of fiscal 2007 our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal control:

We
    periodically review our internal control over financial
    reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal
    control over financial reporting to identify potential changes
    to our processes and systems that may improve controls and
    increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an
    effective internal control environment. Changes may include such
    activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
    consolidating the activities of acquired business units,
    migrating certain processes to our shared services
    organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving
    segregation of duties, and adding additional monitoring
    controls. In addition, when we acquire new businesses, we
    incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired
    business as part of our integration activities. There have been
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    occurred during the quarter ended June 29, 2007 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c)

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

“Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included
    within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this Annual Report on

    our internal control over financial reporting were audited by

Under the Harris Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and the
    Harris Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, we have granted
    shares in the form of performance shares, performance share
    units, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or other
    similar types of share awards. As of June 29, 2007, there
    were issued and outstanding 1,186,889 shares of such awards
    under these plans. Because there is no exercise price associated
    with performance share awards or restricted share awards which
    are granted to employees at no cost, such shares are not
    included in the weighted average exercise price calculation.
