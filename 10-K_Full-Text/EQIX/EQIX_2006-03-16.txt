such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Equinix expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any
updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Equinix’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

Overview

Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed
services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and the world’s largest network providers. Through our Internet Business Exchange hubs, or IBX hubs, in eleven markets in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly
interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while
significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX hubs, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. This critical mass and the resulting “network effect” combined with a strong
financial position continue to drive new customer growth and bookings. As a result of our largely fixed cost model, any growth in revenue would likely drive incremental margins and increased operating cash flow.

Our network neutral business model is a key differentiator for us in the
market. Because we do not operate a network, we are able to offer our customers direct interconnection to the largest aggregation of bandwidth providers and Internet service providers. The world’s top tier Internet service providers, numerous
access networks, second tier providers and international carriers such as AOL, AT&T, British Telecom, Cable & Wireless, Comcast, Level 3, MCI (now known as Verizon Business), NTT, SingTel and Qwest are all currently located at our IBX
hubs. Access to such a wide variety of networks has attracted nine of the top 10 Internet properties and numerous other enterprise and government customers, including Amazon.com, Electronic Arts, Fox Interactive Media, Fujitsu, Gannett, The Gap,
Goldman Sachs, Google, IBM, MSN, NASA, Salesforce.com, Solo Cup, Sony, Washington Mutual, and Yahoo!.

Our services are comprised of three types: Colocation, Interconnection, and Managed IT Infrastructure services.

•

Colocation services include cabinets, power, operations space and storage space for our customers’ colocation needs.

•

Interconnection services provide scalable and reliable connectivity that allow our customers to exchange traffic directly with the service provider of their choice or directly with
each other.

•

Managed IT infrastructure services allow our customers to leverage our significant telecommunications expertise, maximize the benefits of our IBX hubs and optimize their
infrastructure and resources.

The market for our
services has historically been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications services and managed services with their colocation offerings. A number of these telecommunications carriers have eliminated or
reduced their colocation footprint to focus on their core



businesses. Additionally, many of the competitive providers have failed to scale their businesses and have been forced to exit the market. This reduction in
supply in the industry has stabilized pricing and increased the demand for our centers because we have gained many of those customers displaced from these companies as access to their networks is also available in our IBX hubs. Strategically, we
will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings.

Recent Developments

During 2005, we converted our convertible secured notes and preferred stock; granted restricted shares for the first time to our executive officers;
acquired three existing IBX properties in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets; purchased the campus in Ashburn, Virginia that houses our original Washington, D.C. metro area IBX; amended our revolving line of credit
agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and recorded a significant restructuring charge in connection with our decision to exit the approximate 40 acre ground lease for unimproved real property in San Jose. During 2006, we granted additional restricted
shares to our executive officers and approved stock options to be granted to our employees as part of our annual refresh program and announced our intention to expand our presence in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas by building out brand
new centers next to or nearby our existing Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro area IBX centers. For further information on our recent developments, refer to our discussion of “Recent Developments” in our “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K below.

Industry Background

The Internet is a collection of numerous independent networks interconnected with each other to form a network of networks. Users on different networks
are able to communicate with each other through interconnection between these networks. For example, when a user of the Internet sends an email to another user, assuming that each person uses a different network provider, the email must pass from
one network to the other in order to get to the final destination.

In order to accommodate the rapid growth of Internet traffic, an organized approach for network interconnection was needed. The exchange of traffic between these networks became known as peering. Peering is when networks trade traffic at
relatively equal amounts and set up agreements to trade traffic at no charge to the other party. At first, government and non-profit organizations established places where these networks could exchange traffic, or peer, with each other—these
points were known as network access points, or NAPs. Over time, many NAPs became a natural extension of carrier services and were run by such companies as MFS (now a part of Verizon Business), Sprint, Ameritech and Pacific Bell (both now known as
at&t).

Ultimately, these NAPs were unable to scale with
the growth of the Internet and the lack of “neutrality” by the carrier owners of these NAPs created a conflict of interest with the participants. This created a market need for network neutral interconnection points that could accommodate
the rapidly growing need to increase performance for enterprise and consumer users of the Internet, especially with the rise of important content providers such as Microsoft, Yahoo!, AOL and others. In addition, the providers, as well as a growing
number of enterprises required a more secure, reliable solution for direct connection to a variety of telecommunications networks as the importance of their Internet operations continued to grow.

To accommodate Internet traffic growth, the largest of these networks left
the NAPs and began trading traffic by placing private circuits between each other. Peering which once occurred at the NAP locations was moved to these private circuits. Over the years, these circuits became expensive to expand and could not be built
fast enough to accommodate the growth in traffic. This led to a need by the large carriers to find a more efficient way to trade traffic or peer. Customers have chosen Equinix for peering because they are now able to reach all of the networks with
which they peer within one location, with simple direct connections. Their ability to peer across the room, instead of across a metro area has increased the scalability of their operations while decreasing costs for some customers by upwards of 70%.



Our IBX centers are the next-generation interconnection points. They are designed to handle the
scalability issues that exist between both large and small networks, as well as the interconnection between companies who have become critical to the Internet. We have been successful in uniting the major companies that make up the Internet
infrastructure including at&t, Level 3, Qwest, SAVVIS, Sprint and Verizon Business. These companies, which constitute the world’s top Internet service providers, together with most of the major broadband networks, including AOL, Comcast,
Cox Communications and MSN, second tier backbones such as Earthlink, Global Crossing, Verio and WilTel, top international telecommunications carriers, including Bell Canada, British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, France Telecom, Japan Telecom, KDDI,
SingTel, StarHub, Telia and Telstra, a number of fiber, sonet, ethernet and competitive local exchange companies, including Looking Glass Networks and OnFiber Communications, and incumbent local exchange companies, including at&t, BellSouth and
Verizon, are our customers and use us to interconnect with each other and their customers. Additionally, we provide an important industry leadership role in the area of exchange points and are consistently looked to as an industry expert and key
influencer on this subject matter.

Content providers and
enterprises can now control their own network performance by economically reaching the various service providers they wish to work with by establishing direct connections for this connectivity. For our customers, this represents significant cost
savings and increased flexibility to move among providers.

Our Solution

Our IBX centers provide the environment and services to
meet the networking and IT operations challenges facing enterprises, networks and Internet businesses today. As a result, we are able to provide the following key benefits to our customers:

Quality.

Our IBX centers provide
customers with a secure, high quality solution for their colocation needs. Enterprise and content companies have demanding requirements for data center uptime, security, power backup and other important attributes. We have designed our IBX centers
and processes to exceed the requirements for the most important financial institutions, government agencies and key enterprise brands such as Amazon.com, The Gap, Goldman Sachs, Macromedia, Solo Cup, Sony and Ticketmaster. We have a track record of
99.999% uptime and are continually testing and refining processes to ensure that we will continue to provide high levels of stability and quality.

Performance.

Because we provide direct access to the providers that serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet
routes and users, customers can quickly, efficiently, cost-effectively and reliably exchange traffic with their network services providers for higher performance operations. The ability to connect directly to the more than 200 networks enables
high-quality direct interconnection. With the mass of networks present, global enterprises are increasingly looking at ways to provide network diversity and increase performance of their operations, and are utilizing our IBX centers to ensure their
IT infrastructures are operating at the interconnection hub of the Internet. By using multiple networks, customers are able to build redundancy into their operations in the event that one of their network service providers has a service interruption
or restructuring in their business. The network service providers and geographic diversity we offer provides customers with the flexibility to enable the highest performing Internet operations.

Improved Economics.

Our services such as
Equinix Exchange and Equinix Internet Core Exchange facilitate peering and dramatically reduce costs for critical transit, peering and traffic exchange operations by eliminating the costs of private peering or local loops. Networks such as at&t,
British Telecom, Cox Communications and Japan Telcom and content providers such as Electronic Arts, Google, MSN and Yahoo! can save between 20% and 70% of bandwidth costs through the traffic exchange services we offer. In addition, content companies
and enterprises can save significant bandwidth costs because the number of networks housed within Equinix competing for the traffic of these companies results in lower prices while providing increased performance.



Access to International Markets.

We offer our network, content and
enterprise customers a one-stop solution for their outsourced IT infrastructure needs in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. This is especially important for U.S. enterprises who want to expand into Asia-Pacific, where the myriad of complexities for doing
business in each country remains challenging. We offer a consistent standard of quality and support for all our locations throughout the U.S. and Asia-Pacific.

Financial information about our geographic areas can be found in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to become the premier hub for critical Internet properties, enterprises, content providers and government agencies to locate their
information technology infrastructure operations in order to gain maximum benefits from the choice of networks and partners in the most simple and efficient manner. Key components of our strategy include the following:

Continue to Build upon our Critical Mass of Network Providers and Content
Companies, and Grow our Position within Enterprise and Government.

We have assembled a critical mass of premier network providers and content companies and have become one of the core hubs of the Internet. This critical
mass is a key selling point since content companies want to connect with a diverse set of networks to provide the best connectivity to their end-customers, and network companies want to sell bandwidth to content customers and interconnect with other
networks in the most efficient manner available. Currently, we service over 200 unique networks, including all of the top tier networks, allowing our customers to directly interconnect with providers that serve more than 90% of global Internet
routes. We have a growing mass of key players in the enterprise sector, such as The Gap, Gannett, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Salesforce.com, SOLO Cup, Sony, Washington Mutual, XM Radio and others. Similarly, we have experienced increasing success in
attracting customers from the government sector, such as NASA. We expect vertical marketing efforts in the financial, government and digital media segments to be a key growth driver in 2006 and beyond.

Leverage the Network Effect.

As networks,
content providers and other enterprises locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in
their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing
flexibility. The ability to directly interconnect with a wide variety of companies is a key differentiator for us in the market.

Promote our IBX Centers as the Highest Performance Points on the Internet.

Data center reliability and power availability
are two of the most important attributes when customers are choosing a data center provider. Our premier IBX hubs are next-generation data centers and offer customers advanced security, reliability and redundancy. Our security design includes five
levels of biometrics security to access customer cages. Our power infrastructure includes N+1 redundancy for all systems and has delivered 99.999% uptime over the period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2005. Our support staff,
trained to aid customers with operational support, are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Provide New Products and Services within our IBX Centers.

We plan to continue to offer additional products and services that
are most valuable to our customers as they manage their Internet and network businesses and, specifically, as they attempt to effectively utilize multiple networks. For example, we offer an automated service called Equinix Direct to allow customers
to easily choose and provision multiple networks with a simple easy to use portal.

Ensure Continuous Growth for our Customers.

We plan to expand in key markets based on customer demand to ensure a smooth growth path for our customers. For example, we have acquired six
new IBX centers



in our key markets over the last two years, increasing our customer cabinet capacity by 50%. Our strategy is to continue to grow in select existing markets
and possibly expand to additional markets where demand and financial return potential warrant. We expect to execute this expansion strategy in a cost-effective and prudent manner through a combination of acquiring existing centers through lease or
purchase, or building new centers based on key criteria, such as demand and potential financial return, in each market.

Customers

Our customers include carriers and other bandwidth providers, Internet service providers, enterprises, content providers and system integrators. We offer
each customer a choice of business partners and solutions based on their colocation, interconnection and managed IT service needs. As of December 31, 2005, we had 1,138 customers worldwide.

Typical customers in each category include the following:

Customers typically
sign renewable contracts of one or more years in length. Our single largest customer, IBM, represented approximately 11%, 13% and 15% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No other single customer
accounted for more than 10% of revenues during this time.

Services

Our services are comprised of three types: Colocation,
Interconnection and Managed IT Infrastructure services.

Colocation Services

Our IBX centers provide our customers with secure,
reliable and fault-tolerant environments that are necessary for optimum Internet commerce interconnection. Our IBX centers include multiple layers of physical security, scalable cabinet space availability, on-site trained staff 24 hours per day, 365
days per year, dedicated areas for customer care and equipment staging, redundant AC/DC power systems and multiple other redundant, fault-tolerant infrastructure systems. Some specifications or services provided may differ in our Asia-Pacific
locations in order to properly meet the local needs of customers in those locations.

Within our IBX centers, customers can place their equipment and interconnect with a choice of networks or other business partners. We also provide customized solutions for customers looking to package our IBX services
as part of their complex solutions. Our colocation products and services include:

Cabinets.

Our customers have several choices for colocating their networking and server equipment. They can place the equipment in one of our shared or private cages or customize
their space. As a customer’s



colocation requirements increase, they can expand within their original cage or upgrade into a cage that meets their expanded requirements. Cabinets are
priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge.

Power.

Power is an important element of increasing importance in customers’ colocation decisions. We offer both AC and DC power circuits at various amperages and phases
customized to a customer’s individual power requirements. Power is priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge based on the circuit ordered.

IBXflex.

This service allows customers to deploy mission-critical operations personnel
and equipment on-site at our IBX centers. Because of the close proximity to their end-users, IBXflex customers can offer a faster response and quicker troubleshooting solution than those available in traditional colocation facilities. This space can
also be used as a secure disaster recovery point for customers’ business and operations personnel. This service is priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge.

Interconnection Services

Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective
interconnection and traffic exchange between all Equinix customers. These interconnection services are either on a one-to-one basis with direct cross connects or one-to-many through one of our peering services. In peering, we provide an important
industry leadership role by acting as the relationship broker between parties who would like to interconnect within our IBX centers. Our staff holds significant positions in the leading industry groups such as the North American Network
Operators’ Group, or NANOG, and the Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF, and bring a tremendous amount of knowledge to this area. Our staff published industry-recognized white papers and strategy documents in the areas of peering and
interconnection, many of which are used by leading institutions worldwide in furthering the education and promotion of this important network arena. To showcase these efforts, we hold peering forums which are now widely recognized as a very
influential forum for the world’s top peering experts. We will continue to develop additional services in the area of traffic exchange that will allow our customers to leverage the critical mass of networks now available in our IBX centers. Our
current exchange services are comprised of the following:

Physical Cross-Connect/Direct Interconnections.

Customers needing to directly and privately connect to another IBX customer can do so through single or multi-mode fiber. These cross connections are the
physical link between customers and can be implemented within 24 hours of request. Cross-connect services are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge.

Equinix Internet Core Exchange.

This
interconnection service enables direct peering interconnections between major backbone networks and providers. Equinix Internet Core Exchange is a pre-provisioned interconnection package that enables major backbones to connect their networks
directly in a centralized, neutral environment for peering and transit. The service includes pre-provisioned interconnections, premium service levels and specialized customer service features to support the quality and support levels required by the
largest Internet providers in the world. Internet Core Exchange services are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge.

Equinix Exchange.

Customers may choose to peer through and connect to our Equinix Exchange via a central switching
fabric rather than purchase a direct physical cross connection. With a connection to this switch, a customer can aggregate multiple interconnects over one physical connection with up to 10 gigabits of capacity instead of purchasing individual
physical cross connects. In 2005, Equinix announced a partnership with Neustar to facilitate voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) peering. The Exchange service is offered as a bundled service that includes a cabinet, power, cross connects and port
charges. The service is priced by IBX with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge. Individual IBX prices increase as the number of participants on the exchange service grows.



Equinix IBXLink.

Customers who are located in one IBX may need to
interconnect with networks or other customers located in an adjacent IBX in the same metro area. IBXLink allows customers to seamlessly interconnect between IBXs at capacities up to an OC-192, or 10 gigabit level. IBXLink services are priced with an
initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge dependent on the capacity the customer purchases.

Internet Connectivity Services.

Customers who are installing equipment in our IBX centers generally require IP
connectivity or bandwidth services. Although many large customers prefer to contract directly with carriers, we offer customers the ability to contract for these services through us from any of the major bandwidth providers. This service, which is
primarily provided in Asia, is targeted to customers who require a single bill and a single point of support for their entire services contract through Equinix for their bandwidth needs. Internet Connectivity Services are priced with an initial
installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge based on the amount of bandwidth committed.

Managed IT Infrastructure Services

With the continued growth in Internet use, networks, service providers, enterprises and content providers are challenged to deliver fast and reliable service, while lowering costs. With over 200 ISPs and carriers
located in our IBX centers, we leverage the value of network choice with our set of multi-network management and other outsourced IT services.

Professional Services.

Our IBX centers are staffed with Internet and telecommunications specialists who are on-site
and available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These professionals are trained to perform installations of customer equipment and cabling. Professional services are custom-priced depending on customer requirements.

“Smart Hands” Services.

Our
customers can take advantage of our professional “Smart Hands” service, which gives customers access to our IBX staff for a variety of tasks, when their own staff is not on site. These tasks may include equipment rebooting, power cycling,
card swapping, and performing emergency equipment replacement. Services are available on-demand or by customer contract and are priced on an hourly basis.

Equinix Direct.

Equinix Direct is a managed multi-homing service that allows customers to easily provision and manage
multiple network connections over a single interface. Customers can choose branded networks on a monthly basis with no minimums or long-term commitments. This service is priced with an initial install fee and ongoing monthly recurring charges,
dependent on the bandwith used by the customer.

Equinix
Mail Service.

Equinix’s enterprise messaging service, available only in our Singapore location, is a complete outsourced solution, primarily based on the Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange platforms, to which
customers entrust the operation and support of their messaging applications. This service is priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge.

Equinix Command Center.

Equinix Command Center, available only in Asia-Pacific, is a
suite of managed services for the management and monitoring of enterprise-level information systems and network infrastructure. The suite of services allows customers to achieve greater efficiency of their IT infrastructure while reducing the cost
and complexity of administering and managing these functions internally. The services are priced with an initial installation fee and ongoing monthly recurring charges based on customer activity.

Sales and Marketing

Sales.

We use a direct sales force and channel marketing program to market our services
to network, content provider, enterprise, government and Internet infrastructure businesses. We organize our sales force by customer type as well as by establishing a sales presence in diverse geographic regions, which enables efficient



servicing of the customer base from a network of regional offices. In addition to our worldwide headquarters located in Silicon Valley, we have established
an Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Singapore. Our U.S. sales offices are located in New York; Boston; Reston, Virginia; Los Angeles; Honolulu; Chicago and Silicon Valley. Our Asia-Pacific sales offices are located in Hong Kong, Singapore,
Sydney and Tokyo.

Our sales team works closely with each
customer to foster the natural network effect of our IBX model, resulting in access to a wider potential customer base via our existing customers. As a result of the IBX interconnection model, IBX center participants encourage their customers,
suppliers and business partners to also locate in the IBX centers. These customers, suppliers and business partners, in turn, encourage their business partners to locate in IBX centers resulting in additional customer growth. This network effect
significantly reduces our new customer acquisition costs. In addition, large network providers or managed service providers may refer customers to Equinix as a part of their total customer solution.

In 2004, Equinix established a channel sales program to take advantage of the
many networks that were exiting the colocation business to focus on their core competencies. These channel partners are primarily large telecommunications providers whose networks are already installed in Equinix IBX centers and who have customers
that require high quality colocation in addition to the network services of the telecommunications providers.

Marketing.

To support our sales effort and to actively promote our brand in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, we conduct
comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign and on-going customer communications programs. Our marketing efforts are focused on major business and trade publications, online media outlets,
industry events and sponsored activities. Our staff holds leadership positions in key networking organizations and we participate in a variety of Internet, computer and financial industry conferences and place our officers and employees in keynote
speaking engagements at these conferences. We also regularly measure customer satisfaction levels and host key customer forums to ensure customer needs are understood and incorporated in product and service planning efforts. From a brand
perspective, we build recognition through sponsoring or leading industry technical forums and participating in Internet industry standard-setting bodies. We continue to develop and host the industry’s most successful educational forums focused
on peering technologies and peering practices for ISPs and content providers.

Competition

Our current and potential
competition includes:

•

Internet data centers operated by established U.S. communications carriers such as AT&T, Level 3, Qwest, SAVVIS and Verizon Business and Asia-Pacific communications
carriers such as NTT and SingTel.

Unlike the major network providers, who constructed data centers primarily to help sell bandwidth, we have aggregated multiple networks in one location, providing superior diversity,
pricing and performance. Telecommunications companies’ data centers generally only provide one choice of carrier and also prefer customers with high managed services needs as part of their pricing structures. Locating in our IBX centers
provides access to top tier networks and allows customers to negotiate the best prices with a number of carriers resulting in better economics and redundancy. In 2003 and 2004, two major carriers who had built and operated their own data centers
exited the U.S. colocation market. The disposition of these assets has been completed with various owners assuming the assets, including SAVVIS. Because these operators are not network neutral, we believe we have an advantage in gaining the business
of those customers displaced from these carriers because access to their networks is also available in our IBX centers.

•

U.S. Network access points (NAPS) such as Switch and Data and carrier operated NAPs.

NAPs, generally operated by carriers, are typically older
facilities and lack the incentive to upgrade the infrastructure in order to scale with traffic growth. In contrast, we provide state-of-the-art, secure centers and geographic diversity with 24-hour support and a full range of network and content
provider offerings.



•

Vertically integrated web site hosting, colocation and ISP companies such as AboveNet, Digex/Verizon Business and SAVVIS.

Most managed service
providers require that customers purchase their entire network and managed services directly from them. We are a network and service provider aggregator and allow customers the ability to contract directly with the networks and web-hosting partner
best for their business. By locating in one of our IBX centers, hosting companies add more value to our business proposition by bringing in more partners and customers and thus enhancing a network effect.

Unlike other providers whose core businesses are bandwidth or managed
services, we focus on neutral hubs for networks, content providers, enterprises and government. As a result, we are free of the channel conflict common at other hosting/colocation companies. We compete based on the quality of our IBX centers, our
ability to provide a one-stop solution in our U.S. and Asia-Pacific locations, the superior performance and diversity of our network neutral strategy and the economic benefits of the aggregation of top networks and Internet businesses under one
roof. Specifically, we have established relationships with a number of leading hosting companies such as IBM (our largest customer) and others. We expect to continue to benefit from several industry trends including the consolidation of supply in
the colocation market, the need for contracting with multiple networks due to the uncertainty in the telecommunications market, customers’ increasing power requirements, enterprise customers’ growth in outsourcing and the continued growth
of broadband.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had 537 employees. We had 372 employees
based in the U.S. and 165 employees based in Asia-Pacific. Of our U.S. employees, we had 220 based at our corporate headquarters in Foster City, California and our regional sales offices. Of those employees, 84 were in engineering and
operations, 68 were in sales and marketing and 68 were in management and finance. We had 152 employees based at our IBX centers in Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, California; New York, New York;
and the Washington, D.C. area. Of our Asia-Pacific employees, we had 112 at our Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore and our other regional offices. Of those employees, 39 were in engineering and operations, 27 were in sales and marketing and 46
were in management and finance. We had 53 employees based at our IBX centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us:

Risks Related to Our Business

We have incurred substantial losses in the past and may continue to incur additional losses in the future.

Although we have generated cash from operations since the quarter ended
September 30, 2003, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred net losses of $42.6 million, $68.6 million and $84.2



million, respectively. In light of new rules regarding the expensing of stock-based compensation, we do not expect to become net income positive for the
foreseeable future. In addition, if we acquire or build-out additional IBX centers, we will have additional depreciation and amortization expenses that will negatively impact our ability to achieve and sustain profitability. Although our goal is to
achieve profitability, even without giving effect to the expensing of stock-based compensation, there can be no guarantee that we will become profitable, and we may continue to incur additional losses. Even if we achieve profitability, given the
competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

We expect our operating results to fluctuate.

We have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuations in our operating results may cause the
market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including:

•

financing or other expenses related to the acquisition, purchase or construction of additional IBX centers;

•

mandatory expensing of employee stock-based compensation, including restricted shares;

•

demand for space, power and services at our IBX centers;

•

changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the telecommunications and Internet industries;

•

costs associated with the write-off or exit of unimproved or underutilized property;

•

the provision of customer discounts and credits;

•

the mix of current and proposed products and services and the gross margins associated with our products and services;

•

the timing required for new and future centers to open or become fully utilized;

•

competition in the markets in which we operate;

•

conditions related to international operations;

•

increasing repair and maintenance expenses in connection with aging IBX centers;

•

not enough available capacity in our existing IBX centers to book new revenue or delays in opening up new or acquired IBX centers may delay our ability to book new revenue in
markets which have otherwise reached capacity;

•

the timing and magnitude of other operating expenses, including taxes, capital expenditures and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, operations and acquisitions,
if any, of complementary businesses and assets; and

•

the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power.

Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. It is possible that we may never generate net income on a quarterly
or annual basis. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of
operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as



indications of our future performance. In addition, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities
analysts or investors. If this occurs, we could experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock.

If the market price of our stock continues to be highly volatile, the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.

Since January 1, 2005, our common stock has traded between $31.39 and
$56.40 per share. The market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. Actual sales, or the market’s perception with respect to possible sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock
within a narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. Announcements by us or others may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These announcements may include:

•

our operating results;

•

new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt;

•

developments in our relationships with corporate customers;

•

announcements by our customers or competitors;

•

changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;

•

changes in the ratings of our stock by securities analysts;

•

purchase or development of real estate and/or additional IBX centers;

•

announcements with respect to the operational performance of our IBX centers;

•

market conditions for telecommunications stocks in general; and

•

general economic and market conditions.

The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging
telecommunications companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Our inability to use our tax net operating losses will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier
date and in greater amounts which may harm our operating results.

We believe that our ability to use our pre-2003 tax net operating losses, or NOLs, in any taxable year is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(the ”Code”) as a result of the significant change in the ownership of our stock that resulted from our combination with i-STT Pte. Ltd. and Pihana Pacific, Inc. in 2002, which we call the combination. We expect that a significant
portion of our NOLs accrued prior to December 31, 2002 will expire unused as a result of this limitation. In addition to the limitations on NOL carryforward utilization described above, we believe that Section 382 of the Code will also
significantly limit our ability to use the depreciation and amortization on our assets, as well as certain losses on the sale of our assets, to the extent that such depreciation, amortization and losses reflect unrealized depreciation that was
inherent in such assets as of the date of the combination. These limitations will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier date and in greater amounts than would occur absent such limitations.

We are exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Although we received an
unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, in the course of our ongoing evaluation of



our internal controls over financing reporting, we have identified certain areas which we would like to improve and are in the process of evaluating and
designing enhanced processes and controls to address these areas identified during our evaluation, none of which we believe constitutes or will constitute a material change. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective or
sufficient for us, or our independent registered public accounting firm, to issue unqualified reports in the future, especially as our business continues to grow and evolve.

It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations, and differences in
existing controls of any acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting are combined.

Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our internal
reporting systems and controls. We may not be able to implement improvements to our internal reporting systems and controls in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.

If we cannot effectively manage international operations, our revenues may not increase
and our business and results of operations would be harmed.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized 13%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of our revenues outside North America. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, a significant part of our revenues will be
derived from sources outside North America.

To date, the
neutrality of our IBX centers and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our acquired IBX centers, in Singapore in particular, the limited number of carriers available reduces
that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating services and pricing to be competitive in that market.

We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the majority of our revenues and costs have
been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, the majority of revenues and costs in our international operations have been denominated in Singapore dollars, Japanese yen and Australia and Hong Kong dollars. Although we have in the past and may decide
to undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions in the future to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. dollars,
our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies. Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks,
including:

•

costs of customizing IBX centers for foreign countries;

•

protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition;

•

greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

political and economic instability;

•

ability to obtain, transfer, or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to the combined business; and

•

compliance with evolving governmental regulation with which we have little experience.

We are continuing to invest in our expansion efforts but may not have sufficient customer demand in the future to realize expected
returns on these investments.

We are considering the
acquisition or lease of additional properties, including construction of new IBX centers. We will be required to commit substantial operational and financial resources to these IBX centers,



generally 12-18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have sufficient customer demand in those markets to support these centers
once they are built. In addition, unanticipated technological changes could affect customer requirements for data centers and we may not have built such requirements into our new IBX centers. Any of these contingencies, if they were to occur, could
make it difficult for us to realize expected or reasonable returns on these investments.

We may begin construction of new IBX centers which could involve significant risks to our business.

We believe that most of the pre-existing built-out data centers have already been acquired, and that there are few if any viable distressed assets
available for us to acquire in our key markets today. In order to sustain our growth in these markets, we may begin to acquire suitable land with or without structures and build our new IBX centers from the ground up (a “greenfield”
build). A greenfield build involves substantial planning and lead-time, much longer time to completion than we have currently seen in our recent IBX retrofits of existing data centers, and significantly higher costs of construction, equipment, and
materials which could have a negative impact on our returns. Site selection is also a critical factor in our expansion plans, and there may not be suitable properties available in our markets with the necessary combination of high power capacity and
fiber connectivity.

While we may prefer to locate new IBX
centers adjacent to our existing locations, we may be limited by the inventory and location of suitable properties as well as the need for adequate power and fiber to the site. In the event we decide to build new IBX centers separate from our
existing IBX centers, we may not be able to offer the number of networks that we currently provide in an existing IBX center. Fewer networks available in a new IBX center could result in lower interconnection revenue, lower margins, and could have a
negative impact on customer retention over time.

We may make acquisitions,
which pose integration and other risks that could harm our business.

We have recently acquired several new IBX centers, and we may seek to acquire additional IBX centers, real estate for development of new IBX centers, complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. As a
result of these acquisitions, we may be required to incur additional debt and expenditures and issue additional shares of our common stock to pay for the acquired businesses, products, services or technologies, which will dilute our
stockholders’ ownership interest and may delay, or prevent, our profitability. These acquisitions may also expose us to risks such as:

•

the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or achieve the level of quality in such businesses to which our customers are accustomed;

•

the possibility that additional capital expenditures may be required;

•

the possibility that senior management may be required to spend considerable time negotiating agreements and integrating acquired businesses;

•

the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses;

•

the possibility that our customers may not accept either the existing equipment infrastructure or the “look-and-feel” of a new or different IBX center;

•

the possibility that carriers may find it cost-prohibitive or impractical to bring fiber and networks into a new IBX center;

•

the possibility of pre-existing undisclosed liabilities regarding the property or IBX center, including but not limited to environmental or asbestos liability, of which our
insurance may be insufficient or for which we may be unable to secure insurance coverage; and

•

the possibility that the concentration of our IBX centers in the Silicon Valley may increase our exposure to seismic activity and that these centers may be located on or near the
fault zones for which we may not have adequate levels of earthquake insurance.



We cannot assure you that the price for any future acquisitions will be similar to prior IBX
acquisitions. In fact, we expect acquisition costs, including capital expenditures required to build or render new IBX centers operational, to increase in the future. If our revenue does not keep pace with these potential acquisition and
expansion costs, we may not be able to maintain our current or expected margins as we absorb these additional expenses. There is no assurance we would successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions.

The increased use of high power density equipment may limit our ability to
fully utilize our IBX centers.

Customers are increasing
their use of high-density electrical power equipment, such as blade servers, in our IBX centers which has significantly increased the demand for power on a per cabinet basis. Because most of our centers were built several years ago, the current
demand for electrical power may exceed the designed electrical capacity in these centers. As electrical power, not space, is typically the limiting factor in our IBX data centers, our ability to fully utilize our IBX centers may be limited in these
centers. The availability of sufficient power may also pose a risk to the successful operation of our new IBX centers. The ability to increase the power capacity of an IBX, should we decide to, is dependent on several factors including, but not
limited to, the local utility’s ability to provide additional power; the length of time required to provide such power; and/or whether it is feasible to upgrade the electrical infrastructure of an IBX to deliver additional power to customers.
Although we are currently designing and building a much higher power specification, there is a risk that demand will continue to increase and our IBX centers could become obsolete sooner than expected.

Our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased
costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources.

Our IBX centers are susceptible to regional costs of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages such as those that occurred in California during 2001 and in the Northeast in 2003 or natural disasters such as the
tornados in the U.S. East Coast in 2004, and limitations, especially internationally, on availability of adequate power resources. Power outages could harm our customers and our business. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using
backup generators and power supplies, however, we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely even with these protections in place, as was the case with power outages we experienced in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers in
2005. In addition, the overall power shortage in California has increased the cost of energy, and although contractual price increase clauses may exist, we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers.

In each of our markets, we rely on third parties to provide a sufficient
amount of power for current and future customers. At the same time, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, some customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. We generally do
not control the amount of electric power our customers draw from their installed circuits. This means that we could face power limitations in our centers. This could have a negative impact on the effective available capacity of a given center
and limit our ability to grow our business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.

Increases in property taxes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our IBX centers are subject to state and local real property taxes. The
state and local real property taxes on our IBX centers may increase as property tax rates change and as the value of the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Many state and local governments are facing budget deficits, which
may cause them to increase assessments or taxes. If property taxes increase, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.



STT Communications has voting control over a substantial portion of our stock and has influence over matters requiring
stockholder consent.

As of December 31, 2005, STT
Communications, through its subsidiary, i-STT Investments (Bermuda) Ltd., had voting control over approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, STT Communications is not prohibited from buying shares of our stock in public or
private transactions. As a result, STT Communications is able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could
prevent or delay a third party from acquiring or merging with us.

We may be
forced to take steps, and may be prevented from pursuing certain business opportunities, to ensure compliance with certain tax-related covenants agreed to by us in the combination agreement.

We agreed to a covenant in the combination agreement (which we refer to as
the FIRPTA covenant) that we would use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that at all times from and after the closing of the combination, none of our capital stock issued to STT Communications would constitute “United States real
property interests” within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. Under Section 897(c) of the Code, our capital stock issued to STT Communications would generally constitute “United States real property interests” at
such point in time that the fair market value of the “United States real property interests” owned by us equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the aggregate fair market values of (a) our “United States real property
interests,” (b) our interests in real property located outside the U.S., and (c) any other assets held by us which are used or held for use in our trade or business. Currently, the fair market value of our “United States real
property interests” is significantly below the 50% threshold. However, in order to assure compliance with the FIRPTA covenant, we may be limited with respect to the business opportunities we may pursue, particularly if the business
opportunities would increase the amounts of “United States real property interests” owned by us or decrease the amount of other assets owned by us. In addition, we may take proactive steps to avoid our capital stock being deemed
“United States real property interest,” including, but not limited to, (a) a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to some or all of our real property interests, or (b) the formation of a holding company organized under the
laws of the Republic of Singapore which would issue shares of its capital stock in exchange for all of our outstanding stock (this reorganization would require the submission of that transaction to our stockholders for their approval and the
consummation of that exchange). We will take these actions only if such actions are commercially reasonable for us and our stockholders. We have entered into an agreement with STT Communications and its affiliate pursuant to which we will no longer
be bound by the FIRPTA covenant as of September 30, 2009. If we were to breach this covenant, we may be liable for damages to STT Communications.

If regulated materials are discovered at centers leased or owned by us, we may be required to remove or clean-up such materials, the cost of which could be
substantial.

We are subject to various environmental and
health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the generation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations also impose joint and several liability, without regard
to fault, for investigation and cleanup costs on current and former owners and operators of real property and persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances
and materials such as petroleum fuel for emergency generators, as well as batteries, cleaning solutions and other materials. In addition, we lease, own or operate real property at which hazardous substances and regulated materials have been
used in the past. At some of these locations, hazardous substances or regulated materials are known to be present in soil or groundwater and there may be additional unknown hazardous substances or regulated materials present at sites we own, operate
or lease. To the extent any hazardous substances or any other substance or material must be cleaned up or removed from such property, we may be responsible under applicable laws, regulations or leases for the removal or cleanup of such
substances or materials, the cost of which could be substantial. In addition, noncompliance with existing, or adoption of more stringent, environmental or health and safety laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination
could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could be material.



Our non-U.S. customers include numerous related parties of STT Communications.

We continue to have contractual and other business relationships and may
engage in material transactions with affiliates of STT Communications. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of STT Communications’ affiliates may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, entities affiliated
with STT Communications make investments in various companies. They have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in entities that compete with us. In the context of negotiating commercial arrangements with affiliates, conflicts of
interest have arisen in the past and may arise, in this or other contexts, in the future. We cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor.

We depend on a number of third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX centers; if connectivity is interrupted or terminated,
our operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.

The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers’ fiber networks in our IBX centers is critical to our ability to retain and attract new customers. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such we rely
on third parties to provide our customers with carrier services. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the
telecommunications carriers’ customers to encourage them to invest the capital and operating resources required to connect from their centers to our IBX centers. Carriers will likely evaluate the revenue opportunity of an IBX center based on
the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that any carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX centers or that once a carrier has decided to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX centers that
it will continue to do so for any period of time. Further, many carriers are experiencing business difficulties or announcing consolidations. As a result, some carriers may be forced to downsize or terminate connectivity within our IBX centers which
could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Our new
IBX centers require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including
regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. If the establishment of highly diverse Internet connectivity to our IBX centers does not occur, is materially delayed or is discontinued, or is subject to failure, our operating
results and cash flow will be adversely affected. Any hardware or fiber failures on this network may result in significant loss of connectivity to our new IBX expansion centers. This could affect our ability to attract new customers to these IBX
centers or retain existing customers.

Any failure of our physical
infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results.

Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. We must protect our customers’ IBX
infrastructure and their equipment located in our IBX centers. We continue to acquire IBX centers not built by us. If these IBX centers and their infrastructure assets are not in the condition we believe them to be in, we may be required to incur
substantial additional costs to repair or upgrade the centers. The services we provide in each of our IBX centers are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including:

•

human error;

•

physical or electronic security breaches;

•

fire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters;

•

water damage;

•

fiber cuts;

•

power loss;



•

sabotage and vandalism; and

•

failure of business partners who provide our resale products.

Problems at one or more of our IBX centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. We
have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers, including our significant customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level
commitments to these customers. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $457,000 in service level credits to various customers, primarily associated with two separate power outages that affected our Chicago and
Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. If we incur significant financial commitments to our customers in connection with a loss of power, or our failure to meet other service level commitment obligations, our liability insurance and revenue
reserves may not be adequate. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and
retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results.

Furthermore, we are dependent upon Internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere,
some of which have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If for any reason, these
providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

A portion of the managed services business we acquired in the combination involves the processing and storage of confidential customer information.
Inappropriate use of those services could jeopardize the security of customers’ confidential information causing losses of data or financially impacting us or our customers and subjecting us to the risk of lawsuits. Efforts to alleviate
problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of our managed services.

There is no known prevention or defense against denial of service attacks. During a prolonged denial of service attack, Internet service may not be
available for several hours, thus negatively impacting hosted customers’ on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances. Our property and liability insurance may not be adequate to cover
these customer claims.

We resell products and services of third parties
that may require us to pay for such products and services even if our customers fail to pay us for the products and services, which may have a negative impact on our operating results.

In order to provide resale services such as bandwidth, managed services and
other network management services, we contract with third party service providers. These services require us to enter into fixed term contracts for services with third party suppliers of products and services. If we experience the loss of a customer
who has purchased a resale product, we will remain obligated to continue to pay our suppliers for the term of the underlying contracts. The payment of these obligations without a corresponding payment from customers will reduce our financial
resources and may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance and operating results.

IBM accounts for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of IBM as a customer could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, IBM accounted for
11%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of our revenues. We expect that IBM will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Although the term of our IBM contract runs through 2011, IBM currently has



the right to reduce its commitment to us pursuant to the terms and requirements of its customer agreement. If we lose IBM as a customer or if it
significantly reduces the level of its commitment, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

Our IBX centers and other products and services must be able to differentiate themselves from those of other providers of
space and services for telecommunications companies, web hosting companies and other colocation providers. In addition to competing with neutral colocation providers, we must compete with traditional colocation providers, including local phone
companies, long distance phone companies, Internet service providers and web hosting facilities. Similarly, with respect to our other products and services, including managed services, bandwidth services and security services, we must compete with
more established providers of similar services. Most of these companies have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us.

Because of their greater financial resources, some of our competitors have
the ability to adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they have been able to restructure their debt or other obligations. As a result, in the future, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate
revenues and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these competitors could offer colocation on neutral terms, and may start doing so in the same metropolitan areas in which we have IBX centers. Some of these competitors may also
provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled communication services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX centers. If these competitors were able to
adopt aggressive pricing policies together with offering colocation space, our ability to generate revenues would be materially adversely affected.

We may also face competition from persons seeking to replicate our IBX concept by building new centers or converting existing centers that some of our
competitors are in the process of divesting. We may continue to see increased competition for data center space and customers from large real estate investment trusts (“REITS”) who also operate in our market. We may experience competition
from our landlords, some of which are REITS, in this regard. Rather than leasing available space in our buildings to large single tenants, they may decide to convert the space instead to smaller square foot units designed for multi-tenant
colocation use. Landlords/REITS may enjoy a cost effective advantage in providing services similar to those provided by our IBXs, and in addition to the risk of losing customers to these parties this could also reduce the amount of space available
to us for expansion in the future. Competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. Furthermore, enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in outsourcing arrangements may be
reluctant or slow to replace, limit or compete with their existing systems by becoming a customer. Customers may also decide it is cost effective for them to build-out their own data centers which could have a negative impact on our results of
operations. In addition, other companies may be able to attract the same potential customers that we are targeting. Once customers are located in competitors’ facilities, it may be extremely difficult to convince them to relocate to our IBX
centers.

Because we depend on the retention of key employees, failure to
maintain stock option incentives may be disruptive to our business.

Our success in retaining key employees and discouraging them from moving to a competitor is an important factor in our ability to remain competitive. As is common in our industry, our employees are typically
compensated through grants of stock options in addition to their regular salaries. In addition to granting stock options to new hires, we periodically grant new stock options to certain employees as an incentive to remain with the company. To the
extent we are unable to adequately maintain these stock option incentives due to stock option expensing or otherwise, and should employees decide to leave the company, this may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.



Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, failure to attract and retain this base
of customers could harm our business and operating results.

Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including network service providers, site and performance management companies, and enterprise and
content companies. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX center, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX
centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the mix of products and services offered by us, the overall mix of customers, the IBX center’s operating reliability and security and our ability to
effectively market our services. In addition, some of our customers are, and are likely to continue to be, Internet companies that face many competitive pressures and that may not ultimately be successful. If these customers do not succeed, they
will not continue to use the IBX centers. This may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products and services have a long sales cycle that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

A customer’s decision to license cabinet
space in one of our IBX centers and to purchase additional services typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX centers until they are confident that the
IBX center has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Furthermore, we may expend significant time and resources in pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue. Delays due to the length of
our sales cycle may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to securities class action litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations.

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us, a number of our officers and directors, and several investment banks that were underwriters of our initial public
offering. The suits allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional
purchases in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. In July
2003, a special litigation committee of our board of directors agreed to participate in a settlement with the plaintiffs. The settlement agreement, as amended, is subject to court approval and sufficient participation by defendants in similar
actions. If the proposed settlement, as amended, is not approved by the court or a sufficient number of defendants do not participate in the settlement, the defense of this litigation may continue and therefore increase our expenses and divert
management’s attention and resources. An adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may, in the future, be subject to other securities class action or similar litigation.

Risks Related to Our Industry

If the use of the Internet and electronic business does not grow, our revenues may not
grow.

Acceptance and use of the Internet may not continue
to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt or continue to use the Internet and other online services as a medium of commerce. Demand for Internet services and products are subject to a high level of
uncertainty and are subject to significant pricing pressure, especially in Asia-Pacific. As a result, we cannot be certain that a viable market for our IBX centers will materialize. If the market for our IBX centers grows more slowly than we
currently anticipate, our revenues may not grow and our operating results could suffer.



Government regulation may adversely affect the use of the Internet and our business.

Various laws and governmental regulations governing Internet related
services, related communications services and information technologies, and electronic commerce remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. This is true both in the U.S. and the various foreign countries in
which we operate. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, and taxation, apply to the Internet and to related services such as ours. We
have limited experience with such international regulatory issues and substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the development
of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the Internet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S.
and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and their service providers. The compliance with, adoption or modification of, laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or interpretations of existing laws,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

Industry consolidation may have a negative impact on our business model.

The telecommunications industry is currently undergoing consolidation. As customers combine businesses, they may require less colocation space, and there
may be fewer networks available to choose from. Given the competitive and evolving nature of this industry, further consolidation of our customers and/or our competitors may present a risk to our network neutral business model and have a negative
impact on our revenues. In addition, increased utilization levels industry-wide could lead to a reduced amount of attractive expansion opportunities available to us.

Terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the ensuing
declaration of war on terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility appear to be having an adverse effect on business, financial and general economic conditions internationally. These effects may, in
turn, increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers,
our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX centers. We may not have adequate property and liability insurance to cover catastrophic events or attacks.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

There is no disclosure to report pursuant to Item 1B.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our executive offices are located in Foster City, California, and we also have sales offices in several cities throughout the United States. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore and we also have
some office space in Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan. We have entered into leases for or own IBX centers in Ashburn, Virginia; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, California; Newark and
Secaucus, New Jersey; Hong Kong; Singapore; Sydney, Australia and Tokyo, Japan. We own an office/warehouse complex in Ashburn, Virginia. We also hold a ground leasehold interest in certain unimproved real property in San Jose, California, consisting
of approximately 40 acres; however, we recorded a restructuring charge during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to this certain unimproved real property, which we do not utilize for any purpose, as we made the decision to not develop this land and
will complete the exit of this property in its entirety no later than December 31, 2007.



ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On July 30, 2001 and August 8, 2001, putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us, certain of our officers and directors (the “Individual Defendants”), and several investment
banks that were underwriters of our initial public offering. The cases were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased our stock between August 10, 2000 and
December 6, 2000. In addition, similar lawsuits were filed against approximately 300 other issuers and related parties. The purported class action alleges violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”)
and Sections 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) against us and the Individual Defendants. The plaintiffs have since dismissed the Individual Defendants without prejudice. The suits allege
that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases in the aftermarket at
pre-determined prices. The plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. The action seeks damages in an
unspecified amount. On February 19, 2003, the Court dismissed the Section 10(b) claim against us, but denied the motion to dismiss the Section 11 claim.

In July 2003, a Special Litigation Committee of the Equinix Board of Directors approved a settlement agreement and related
agreements which set forth the terms of a settlement between us, the Individual Defendants, the plaintiff class and the vast majority of the other approximately 300 issuer defendants and the individual defendants currently or formerly associated
with those companies. Among other provisions, the settlement provides for a release of us and the individual defendants and our agreeing to assign away, not assert, or release certain potential claims we may have against our underwriters. The
settlement agreement also provides a guaranteed recovery of $1 billion to plaintiffs for the cases relating to all of the approximately 300 issuers. To the extent that the underwriter defendants settle all of the cases for at least $1 billion, no
payment will be required under the issuers’ settlement agreement. To the extent that the underwriter defendants settle for less than $1 billion, the issuers are required to make up the difference. It is anticipated that any potential financial
obligation of Equinix to plaintiffs pursuant to the settlement, of which such claims are currently expected to be less than $3.4 million, will be covered by existing insurance and we do not expect that the settlement will involve any payment by us.
We have no information as to whether there are any material limitations on the expected recovery by other issuer defendants of any potential financial obligation to plaintiffs from their own insurance carriers. On February 15, 2005, the court
granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, subject to certain modifications consistent with its opinion. Those modifications have been made. There is no assurance that the court will grant final approval to the settlement. As approval
by the Court cannot be assured, we are unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of the litigation would have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

On October 13, 2004, the Court certified a Section 11 class in four
of the six cases that were the subject of class certification motions and determined that the class period for Section 11 claims is the period between the initial public offering and the date that unregistered shares entered the market. The
Court noted that its decision on those cases is intended to provide strong guidance to all parties regarding class certification in the remaining cases. Plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify a class in the Equinix case. Until the settlement is
finalized and approved by the Court, or in the event such settlement is not approved, we and our officers and directors intend to continue to defend the actions vigorously.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

None during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITITIES

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System under the
symbol of “EQIX.” Our common stock began trading in August 2000. The following table sets forth on a per share basis the low and high closing prices of our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq National Market during the last two years.

As of
December 31, 2005, we had issued 27,444,566 shares of our common stock held by approximately 431 registered holders.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We
currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, for future growth. Future dividends on our common stock, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our operations, capital requirements and
surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited under our line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, such that, without the
prior written consent of Silicon Valley Bank, the aggregate amount of any cash dividends may not exceed 25% of our assets.

The effective date of the Registration Statement for our initial public offering, filed on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File
No. 333-93749), was August 10, 2000. The class of securities registered was common stock. There has been no change to the disclosure contained in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 regarding the use of
proceeds generated by our initial public offering of its common stock.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we did not issue or sell any new securities.



Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table provides information as of December 31, 2005 with respect to shares of our common stock issuable
under our existing equity compensation plans:

our security holders:

The Equinix, Inc. 2001 Supplemental
Stock Plan (the “2001 Plan”) was adopted by the Board of Directors on September 26, 2001. We have reserved 1,493,961 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2001 Plan, under which nonstatutory stock options and restricted shares
may be granted to non-executive officer employees and consultants of ours or any parent or subsidiary corporation. Options granted under the 2001 Plan must have an exercise price equal to no less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of
grant; however, as of December 31, 2005, all options granted under the 2001 Plan have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. As of December 31, 2005, options to purchase 955,005 shares of common
stock were outstanding under the 2001 Plan, 461,766 shares remained available for future grants, and options covering 77,190 shares had been exercised. In the event we are acquired and either a) outstanding awards are not assumed or replaced by the
acquiring entity, or b) an outstanding award holder’s employment or service is involuntarily terminated within 18 months of such acquisition, such outstanding awards under the 2001 Plan will become fully vested. The Board may amend or terminate
the 2001 Plan at any time, and the 2001 Plan will continue in effect indefinitely unless the board decides to terminate the plan earlier.

Overview

Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed
services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and the world’s largest network providers. Through our IBX centers in eleven markets in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical
traffic exchange requirements. As of December 31, 2005, we had announced IBX centers in Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. areas in the United States and Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo
in the Asia-Pacific region.

Direct interconnection to our
aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we
believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection.
These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering
overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect. This critical mass and the resulting “network effect”, combined with our strong financial
position, continue to drive new customer growth and bookings.

Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunication products and services with their colocation offerings. A number of these telecommunications carriers have eliminated or
reduced their colocation footprint to focus on their core businesses. In 2003, as an example, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced its plans to exit the colocation and hosting market in order to focus on its core service
offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold its U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. In 2005, other providers, such as Abovenet and
Verio, have selectively sold off certain of their colocation centers. Each of these colocation providers own and operate a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 200 networks operating out of our IBX centers. As a result,
we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage,
especially when the telecommunications industry is experiencing many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, this industry
consolidation has constrained the supply of suitable data center space and has had a stabilizing effect on industry pricing.



Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and
selectively improve our footprint and service offerings, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003, our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2005 expansions in the
Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets and our 2006 announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas (see “Recent Developments” below). However, we will continue to
be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles area markets, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing
customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like our
recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term
financing arrangements in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, as was the case with our recent Ashburn campus property acquisition, or a long-term leasing
arrangement.

In addition to our successful strategy of
acquiring previously or partially built-out centers, we are also contemplating the possibility of new construction in selective markets where the inventory for high quality data centers is limited, such as our recent announcements on our intention
to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. Decisions to build will consider factors such as customer demand, market pricing and the financial returns associated with the construction. Future purchases or construction
may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash.

Recent Developments

In
January 2005, we converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and unpaid interest, held by STT Communications Ltd., into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of
our common stock in February 2005. We refer to this transaction as the STT convertible secured notes conversion. The remaining 5% of the convertible secured notes outstanding, totaling $1.9 million, was converted in November 2005 (see below).

In February 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the issuance of 320,500 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. Prior to this, we had not granted any restricted shares. These restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if
the stock appreciates to certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for
changes in the market price of our common stock until the restricted shares become vested. On the date of grant of the restricted shares in February 2005, we recorded a $14.4 million deferred stock-based compensation charge. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, we recognized a reduction in deferred stock-based compensation of $3.3 million as a result of a declining stock price and forfeitures and recorded $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted
shares for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4.6 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to these restricted shares. We expect stock-based compensation
expense related to these restricted shares to impact our results of operations through 2008.

In June 2005, we entered into a long-term lease for a 120,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area. We refer to this transaction as the Sunnyvale IBX acquisition. This center will be interconnected to
our three other Silicon Valley area IBX centers through redundant dark fiber links that will be managed by us to allow customers in each center to leverage the benefits of directly interconnecting with other customers in the other centers. Payments
under this lease, which qualifies as an operating lease, total $45.3 million, which will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in October 2005 and will be payable through September 2020. We intend to begin placing customers in this IBX
center in mid-2006. We intend to invest approximately $14.2 million of capital expenditures to upgrade this center to Equinix standards, of which $2.1 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.



In July 2005, we entered into a (i) long-term sublease of a 107,000 square foot data center in the
Chicago metro area and (ii) an asset purchase agreement to purchase the IBX plant and machinery assets located within this new IBX center from Verio. We refer to this transaction as the Chicago IBX acquisition. This center is in the same
building as our existing Chicago IBX center, which it will be interconnected to in order to leverage existing networks and customers. Payments due to Verio for the Chicago IBX acquisition total $25.2 million, of which $1.9 million was paid in two
lump-sum payments in 2005 and the remaining $23.3 million will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in November 2005 and will be payable through August 2015. We accounted for the Chicago IBX acquisition as a single accounting arrangement
with multiple elements. As a result, we assessed the fair value of both the building and equipment elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each element. We have determined that the building component of the Chicago IBX acquisition is a
long-term operating lease and the equipment portion of the transaction represents a financed asset purchase. We took possession of this property and took title to the equipment in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as
well as a financing obligation liability, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments for the equipment portion of this transaction, to be recorded as financed assets, are payable monthly, which commenced November 2005 and will be payable through
August 2015, at an effective interest rate of approximately 7.50% per annum. Payments for the building portion of this transaction, which is an operating lease, are also payable monthly, which commenced November 2005 and will be payable through
August 2015, and total approximately $11.7 million in cumulative lease payments. We intend to begin placing customers in this IBX center in the first half of 2006. We intend to invest approximately $17.0 million of capital expenditures to upgrade
this center to Equinix standards, of which $5.8 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.

In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area, which is comprised of the building, building improvements
and land. We refer to this transaction as the Los Angeles IBX acquisition. This center will be interconnected with dark fiber to our existing two IBX centers in the downtown Los Angeles area. The total purchase price for the Los Angeles IBX
acquisition, including closing costs, totaled $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. We assessed the fair value of the building, building improvements and land elements of the Los Angeles IBX acquisition and then
assigned the relative fair value to each element when we recorded this transaction in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the
purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005 and we received proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million, which was net of closing costs. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects
of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as
the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing are payable monthly, which commenced in
January 2006 and will be payable through December 2025, at an effective interest rate of approximately 7.75% per annum. We currently intend to begin placing customers in this center during the first half of 2006. Pursuant to the terms of the
lease for the Los Angeles IBX, we are required to invest approximately $14.0 million of capital expenditures to upgrade this center to Equinix standards, of which $3.7 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the remainder will be
incurred during 2006.

In September 2005, we entered into a
$50.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with the same bank. The new $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line has a
three-year commitment, which enables us to borrow, repay and re-borrow the full amount, up to September 15, 2008. We refer to this transaction as the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Borrowings under the $50.0 million
Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million from the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank
revolving credit line, which we refer to as the $30.0 million drawdown. The $30.0 million drawdown was paid back in full in January 2006. The $30.0 million drawdown was used to fund a portion of the purchase of the Ashburn campus property
acquisition (see below). As of December 31, 2005, the $50.0 million Silicon Valley



Bank revolving credit line had an interest rate of 6.12% per annum. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also features sublimits,
which allow us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for
borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown described above, we had
utilized $6.7 million of the credit line through the issuance of letters of credit, and, as a result, we had $13.3 million remaining available for borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The $50.0 million Silicon
Valley Bank revolving credit line is collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains several financial covenants which require compliance with maximum leverage ratios, working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, which
we were in full compliance with as of December 31, 2005. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line provides us with additional liquidity and financing flexibility.

In October 2005, we purchased an office/warehouse complex known as the Beaumeade Business Park located in Ashburn, Virginia,
which we refer to as the Ashburn campus. We purchased the entire 32.6-acre Ashburn campus, which contains six buildings with approximately 462,000 rentable square feet, and was approximately 95% leased. We refer to this transaction as the Ashburn
campus property acquisition. We currently occupy approximately 269,000 square feet within three of the buildings. The total purchase price for the Ashburn campus, including closing costs, was $53.7 million, which the Company paid for in full in
October 2005. We will continue to operate our existing data centers within the Ashburn campus. For those buildings that we do not occupy, we collect rental income from the current tenants and are evaluating these buildings in regards to our future
expansion plans. We may decide to sell those buildings that will not be used for our current operations or expansion plans in the future. In addition, we entered into a mortgage transaction to finance the Ashburn campus. The financing totals $60.0
million at 8% and will be amortized over 20 years. We refer to this transaction as the Ashburn campus financing. The Ashburn campus financing closed in December 2005, and as a result, we received $60.0 million in cash proceeds and recorded a $60.0
million mortgage payable at that time. Payments for the Ashburn campus financing are payable monthly, which commenced February 2006 and will be payable through January 2026. The Ashburn campus financing is collateralized by the Ashburn campus
property and related assets. Pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing, we have agreed to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007.

In October 2005, in light of the availability of fully or partially built-out
data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion among some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision to exit the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease because opportunities
for future expansion were no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next
four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. We refer to this transaction as the San Jose ground lease termination. As a result of
the San Jose ground lease termination, we recorded a $33.8 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, as well as the write-off of all
remaining property and equipment attributed to the development of this property.

In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the remaining convertible secured notes and unpaid interest, which remained after the 95% STT convertible secured notes conversion in January 2005, into 240,578
shares of our preferred stock. On the same date, STT Communications also exercised their outstanding preferred stock warrant for 965,674 shares of our preferred stock, resulting in $10,000 of cash proceeds to us and simultaneously converted all such
preferred stock, including the 1,868,667 shares of our preferred stock that they had previously held, into 3,074,919 shares of our common stock. The conversion activity was done in connection with STT Communications’ decision to divest itself
of its holdings in our securities as they determined that we were no longer a core asset after re-assessing their strategic goals and objectives. We refer to this transaction as the STT divestiture. The STT divestiture was completed in November
2005.



In January 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved stock options to be
granted to employees, excluding executive officers, to purchase an aggregate of 648,500 shares of common stock as part of our annual refresh program. The actual grant date and the exercise price of such stock options are expected to be determined
sometime in March 2006. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved the issuance of 250,000 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. The restricted shares are subject to four-year
vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates at pre-determined levels. All such equity awards will be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements, which are expected
to have a significant impact to us. We expect stock-based compensation expense related to these equity awards to impact our results of operations through 2009. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.

In February 2006, we announced our intention to build out a new IBX center within the Ashburn campus property in order to further expand our existing
Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center. We intend to build out one of the undeveloped buildings located on the Ashburn campus property for a cost of approximately $50.0 to $55.0 million, of which approximately $40.0 million is expected to be
incurred in 2006. The center will feature an updated design that will enable us to support the increased power and cooling demands of customers. We intend to open the new center for customers in early 2007. We refer to this project as the
Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project. The Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project will fulfill our requirement to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant
to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing.

In February
2006, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to purchase a vacant 228,000 square foot standalone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. The agreement is subject to numerous
closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion by us of a comprehensive due diligence review of the property. As part of the evaluation process, we are considering several partnering and financing options for building out this center and
are also evaluating options to build out this center in a phased approach. A new center would be interconnected to our downtown Chicago IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We refer to this project as the Chicago metro area
IBX expansion project. If we purchase this building, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and
judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

•

Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts;

•

Accounting for income taxes;

•

Estimated and contingent liabilities;

•

Accounting for property and equipment;

•

Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill;



•

Accounting for asset retirement obligations;

•

Accounting for leases and IBX acquisitions;

•

Accounting for restructuring charges; and

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation.

Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

We derive more than 90% of our revenues from recurring
revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation services, such as from the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection services, such as cross connects and Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect customers within our
centers; (3) managed infrastructure services, such as Equinix Direct, bandwidth, mail service and managed platform solutions and (4) other services consisting of rent from non-IBX space. The remainder of our revenues are from non-recurring
revenue streams, such as from the recognized portion of deferred installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term
of the contract, generally one to three years for IBX space customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the greater of the term of the related contract
or expected customer relationship. Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process as long as they meet the criteria for separate recognition under EITF
Abstract No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Revenue from bandwidth and equipment is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with EITF Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net
as an Agent”, primarily because we act as the principal in the transaction, take title to products and services and bear inventory and credit risk. To the extent we do not meet the criteria for gross basis accounting for bandwidth and equipment
revenue, we record the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized on a cash basis when collectible and no remaining performance obligations exist to the extent that the revenue has not previously been
recognized.

We occasionally guarantee certain service levels,
such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, we reduce revenue for any credits given to the customer as a result. We generally have the ability to determine such service
level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these credits have not been significant; however, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a total of $457,000 in service level credits to various
customers primarily in connection with two separate power outages that affected our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers.

Revenue is recognized only when the service has been provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable
and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. We assess collection based on a number of factors,
including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers, although in certain cases we obtain a security interest in a customer’s equipment placed
in our IBX centers or obtain a deposit. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In
addition, we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for those customers that we had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition
of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current
economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our reserves. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the
full amount of a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic customer balances. A general reserve is established for all other accounts based on the age of the invoices. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management
has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.



A significant portion of our customer base is comprised of businesses throughout the U.S. However, a
portion of our revenues is derived from our Asia-Pacific operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our revenues were split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, our
revenues were split approximately 87% in the U.S. and 13% in Asia- Pacific. As of December 31, 2005, one customer, IBM, accounted for 11% of annual revenues and 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2004, this same customer
accounted for 13% of annual revenues and 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2003, this same customer accounted for 15% of annual revenues and 11% of accounts receivable. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of
accounts receivable or annual revenues for the periods presented.

Historically, a significant portion of our non-recurring revenues are derived from the amortization of deferred installation fees. These non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred
and recognized ratably over the greater of the term of the related contract or expected customer relationship. This amortization period represents a significant management estimate, since we are required to estimate the expected life of our customer
relationships in order to determine the appropriate length of the amortization period. Should management determine that our expected customer lives are less than originally anticipated, additional amortization would be required, which would increase
revenues in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that our expected customer lives are greater than originally anticipated, less amortization would be required, which would decrease revenues in the period
such determination was made.

Accounting for Income
Taxes.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method

.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment
including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning strategies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We also account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies.”

We currently have provided for a full
valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We have considered the positive and negative evidences affecting the assessment of a full valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence, management does not believe it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future. Should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future, a reversed adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit
net income in the period such determination is made.

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income taxes also involves estimating the impact of additional taxes resulting from
tax examinations and uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to estimate the actual outcome of any such audits and the impact of uncertainties. Actual results could vary
from these estimates. For example, in July 2005, we received a Notice of Proposed Assessment of Income Tax from the state of Hawaii asserting a tax deficiency, plus interest, totaling $613,000, which we refer to as the Hawaii tax assessment. The
deficiency stems from certain refundable tax credits that the state of Hawaii subsequently disallowed in the examination of the Hawaii income tax returns for the tax years of 2000 and 2001 filed by Pihana Pacific, Inc., which we acquired on
December 31, 2002. We strongly believe the disallowance of the refundable tax credits by the state of Hawaii is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the claim. We intend to oppose the Hawaii tax
assessment vigorously and will file a timely request with the Board of Review in the state of



Hawaii to appeal the Hawaii tax assessment. We do not believe it is probable that we will be required to pay the Hawaii tax assessment upon the completion of
the appeals process. As a result, we have not accrued for any loss contingencies in connection with this Hawaii tax assessment as of December 31, 2005.

Estimated and Contingent Liabilities.

Management estimates exposure on certain liabilities and contingent
liabilities, such as property taxes and litigation, based on the best information available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, management records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment
history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis
for which the tax is calculated on said property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property of one of our IBX center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, our property tax
obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and circumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions in our estimates of the potential or actual liability
could materially impact our results of operation and financial position.

For litigation claims, when management can reasonably estimate the range of loss and when an unfavorable outcome is probable, a contingent liability is recorded. For current legal proceedings, management believes that
it has adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, because an unfavorable outcome to current legal proceedings
is not probable, management has determined that no accrual is needed. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the
potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position.

Accounting for Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at original cost or at relative fair value for acquired property and equipment, or in the case of IBX
centers that we acquire, at fair value at the time of acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX equipment and two to
thirteen years for IBX equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement, unless they are considered integral
equipment, in which case they are amortized over the lease term. Buildings owned by us are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the building, which is generally forty to fifty years. Pursuant to EITF Issue 05-6, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination”, which we adopted in the second quarter of 2005 and which did not have a significant impact to us, (i) leasehold
improvements acquired in a business combination are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition and
(ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease
periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased.

Should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service is less than originally anticipated, or if any
of our property and equipment is deemed to have incurred an impairment, additional depreciation, or an impairment charge would be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management
determine that the actual useful lives of its property and equipment placed into service is greater than originally anticipated, less depreciation may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination is made.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including
Goodwill.

We account for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”, or in the case of goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142,



“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, consisting primarily of our IBX centers and
goodwill, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis during the fourth quarter for goodwill. Such events or circumstances include, but
are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. We currently operate in one reportable segment; however our goodwill is attributed solely to our
Singapore reporting unit.

Significant judgments and
assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of
that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost,
economic obsolescence, and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Our net
long-lived assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 included property and equipment of $438.8 million and $343.4 million, respectively, and goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of $21.8 million and $22.3 million, respectively.

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.

We account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” Our asset retirement obligations are primarily related to our IBX Centers,
of which the majority are leased under long-term arrangements, and, in certain cases, are required to be returned to the landlords in original condition. All of our IBX center leases have been subject to significant development by us in order to
convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX centers. The majority of our IBX centers’ initial lease terms expire at various dates ranging from 2010 to 2020 and all of them have renewal options available to us. The
actual cost of returning these IBX centers back to original condition to the landlords is unknown to us since we have not had to do this yet and do not anticipate doing this for quite some time. Therefore, in order to arrive at appropriate asset
retirement obligations for our various IBX centers requires numerous estimates, including estimating how many lease renewal periods we expect to pursue for each of these IBX centers and the cost of removing and disposing of all of the property and
equipment that we have placed into these IBX centers. Liabilities for these asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at their net present value and are included as a component of our property and equipment. In subsequent periods,
accretion expense is recorded to accrete these liabilities to their future value over the remaining estimated period through the anticipated asset retirement date.

Should management determine that the cost of returning these IBX centers to their original condition is less than originally
anticipated, less accretion expense may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination was made, which would also benefit future periods through the actual asset retirement date. Conversely, should management determine
that the cost of returning these IBX centers to their original condition is greater than originally anticipated, more accretion expense may be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination is made, which would also
negatively impact future periods through the actual asset retirement date.

Accounting for Leases and IBX acquisitions.

We currently have fifteen operational IBX centers in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific and three that are not yet operational consisting of the
recently-acquired Sunnyvale IBX, Chicago IBX and Los Angeles IBX, all of which are described above (see “Recent Developments”) and are scheduled to open for business during the first half of 2006. Our strategy, until recently, had been to
enter into long-term leases for our IBX centers rather than to purchase and own these properties; however, commencing with our recent Los Angeles IBX acquisition and Ashburn campus property acquisition, we have altered this strategy by purchasing
rather than leasing these properties. We may decide to purchase, rather than lease, other property in the future, as evidenced by our recent announcement on the Chicago metro area IBX expansion



project. The majority of our IBX centers are accounted for as operating leases; however, in April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square
foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area, which we refer to as our new Washington, D.C. metro area IBX. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We
account for leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” Our analysis of this lease required significant judgment and estimates in order to assess the fair value of the leased property and determine our incremental
borrowing rate given no implicit rate was defined within the lease to allow us to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments. In addition, as this lease contained land, building and equipment elements, we had to separate the
individual elements and analyze each element separately, as well as determine if the equipment was considered to be integral equipment to the building. Similarly, sometimes we will lease a building and at the same time buy the equipment located in
the building, such as our recent Chicago IBX acquisition. In this case, we accounted for the Chicago IBX acquisition as a single accounting arrangement with multiple elements. As a result, we assessed the fair value of both the building and
equipment elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each element. A full purchase transaction, such as our recent purchase of the Ashburn campus property, required a similar analysis since we acquired land, building and equipment
elements and also had to assign the relative fair value to each element.

While our first seven IBX centers were designed and built by us, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur to build out new
space, we have altered our business strategy to acquire partially or fully built-out data centers rather than build out our own data centers in order to meet our IBX expansion needs. However, in markets with high demand and where partially or fully
built-out data centers are no longer available to acquire, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to build new IBX centers as evidenced by our recent announcements on the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro area IBX expansion projects. Each
individual IBX expansion transaction, either in the form of a long-term lease or the purchase of real property, is unique. For example, with respect to the Santa Clara IBX acquisition in December 2003, rather than enter into a long-term lease for
both the building and IBX plant and equipment like the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX transaction mentioned above, we leased only the building in Santa Clara and purchased the IBX property and equipment located in the building. Yet, the building
lease had payment terms which were at a premium to prevailing market rates for similar properties at the time of signing the lease. As a result, we recorded an unfavorable lease liability, which is being amortized into rent expense over the term of
the lease. Also, given that the Santa Clara IBX was an operating data center, unlike the vacant Washington, D.C. metro area IBX, we were required to negotiate with various customers located in the IBX and enter into new contracts with these
customers. In addition, we hired a number of the employees that were already working in this IBX. As a result, we recorded several intangible assets.

In summary, each individual IBX center expansion will require a significant amount of judgment and management estimates in order to properly address the
accounting treatment.

Accounting for Restructuring
Charges.

We have recorded restructuring charges in four of the past five years as we modified our business strategy in light of changing economic circumstances. Most recently, in October 2005, in light of the
availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in some of the four IBX centers we currently operate in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision to exit the approximately 40
acre San Jose ground lease because opportunities for future expansion were no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease
whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. As a result of the San Jose ground lease
termination, we recorded a $33.8 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and
equipment attributed to the development of this property.



We account for such activities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, we had to estimate the future cash payments required to exit certain leases for which we have taken restructuring charges for during 2004 and 2005, net of
any estimated sub-rental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then determine the present value of such future cash flows to record the appropriate restructuring charges. In future periods, we will record accretion
expense to accrete our accrued restructuring liabilities up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of certain leases. These restructuring activities required a significant amount of judgment and
management estimates in order to determine a reasonable scenario of future net cash flows required to exit certain leases. Should the actual lease exit costs differ from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring charges
associated with certain of these leases, which would impact net income in the period such determination was made. In addition, in the future, circumstances may change which would require us to record additional restructuring charges, which would
require similar levels of judgment and management estimates in order to determine the appropriate restructuring charge to record.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

We accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” through December 31, 2005. As permitted under SFAS No. 123, we used the intrinsic value-based method of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” to account for our employee stock-based compensation plans through December 31, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense was based on the difference, if any, on the date of
grant, between the fair value of our shares and the exercise price of the option. Unearned deferred compensation resulting from employee option grants was amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual options, in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” We have also adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of SFAS No. 123.”

Primarily as a result of employee stock options being granted at exercise prices below fair market value prior to our initial public offering (IPO) in
August 2000, we recorded a deferred stock-based compensation charge on our balance sheet of $54.5 million in 2000, which was amortized over the four-year vesting life of these individual stock options net of the reversal of any previously recorded
accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeitures of those stock options prior to vesting. The amortization of the deferred stock-based compensation related to these pre-IPO stock options ended in August 2004. However, we also
recognize stock-based compensation in connection with employee stock option grants modified subsequent to issuance, primarily in connection with termination of employment as was the case with stock options that we modified in November 2005 in
connection with an employee separation agreement with one of our executive officers, which resulted in an additional $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for us during the quarter ended December 31, 2005. In addition, in February
2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 320,500 restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. These restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock
appreciates to certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for changes in
the market price of our common stock until the restricted shares become vested. On the date of grant of the restricted shares in February 2005, we recorded a $14.4 million deferred stock-based compensation charge. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, we recognized a reduction in deferred stock-based compensation of $3.3 million as a result of a declining stock price and forfeitures and recorded $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted
shares for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4.6 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to these restricted shares. We expect stock-based compensation
expense related to these restricted shares to impact our results of operations through 2008. As of December 31, 2005, deferred stock-based compensation on our balance sheet, which was primarily related to restricted shares, totaled $4.9
million, and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of



$8.3 million, $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Had we recognized stock-based compensation under the fair value provisions of SFAS
No. 123, we would have recognized stock-based compensation expense of $32.7 million, $20.8 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
assumptions appropriate to these periods. For further detailed information on how we calculated these pro forma stock-based compensation charges, see Note 1 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of
stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and
amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does
not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be re-measured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS No. 123; however, it
changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows from operating to financing activities. In addition, in March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), which offers
guidance on SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive. Key topics of SAB No. 107
include discussion on the valuation models available to preparers and guidance on key assumptions used in these valuation models, such as expected volatility and expected term, as well as guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of SFAS
No. 123(R) and disclosure considerations, among other topics. SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 were effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however in April 2005, the SEC approved a new rule that SFAS
No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 are now effective for public companies for annual, rather than interim, periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the first quarter of 2006 will be the first period in which we will report
stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107.

We are currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107
(collectively, the “new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation”). The new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation provides for several transition methods available for companies to choose:

•

Modified prospective application;

•

Modified retrospective application;

•

Modified retrospective application to all prior periods; and

•

Modified retrospective application to only interim prior periods of the year of adoption.

We have selected the modified prospective application method, which means that we will not restate any prior financial
statements and only apply the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation on a prospective basis, commencing with the first quarter of 2006, which will include all unvested and outstanding equity awards as of January 1, 2006 in
addition to new equity awards that we will issue commencing in 2006 and beyond. We generally grant or administer three types of equity awards or plans: (i) stock options, which are generally subject to a four-year vest period,
(ii) restricted stock with both a service and market price condition and (iii) an employee stock purchase plan. Although we will continue to monitor equity award behavior within our industry, and modify our compensation structure
accordingly and as appropriate, we do not anticipate any immediate changes in the types of equity awards or the characteristics of the equity awards that we have granted in the past for at least the foreseeable future other than our intention to
reduce the quantity of equity awards we grant in the future in order to manage the effects of both the dilution to our equity base as well as the size of our stock-based compensation charge; however, one change that we elected to make in regards to
stock options was to reduce the contractual life of all new option grants, commencing with grants in the fourth quarter of 2005, from ten years to seven years.



The new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation allows companies a variety of choices in
selecting an appropriate option-pricing model to estimate fair value. After analyzing and assessing various options, we have selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value for both stock options and our employee stock
purchase plan and have selected a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate fair value for new restricted stock awards that contain both a service and market price condition as the most appropriate valuation methods for us at this time. In order to arrive
at an estimate of fair value for equity awards, these option-pricing models require numerous assumptions to be made, such as the expected volatility of our stock and the expected life of the individual equity awards. In addition, the new accounting
guidance for stock-based compensation requires that we apply an appropriate forfeiture rate to the stock-based compensation charge that we would otherwise incur to account for those equity awards that will not vest as a result of expected employee
turnover or forfeitures. As a result, volatility, expected life and forfeiture rate represent significant assumptions that will have a significant impact on the stock-based compensation that we will record. We are currently analyzing historical
trends for each of these key assumptions in order to arrive at the most appropriate estimates. Regarding estimated life, we currently expect to use the simplified method described in SAB No. 107 due to our limited history.

Furthermore, while we had previously selected to amortize stock-based
compensation on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of individual equity awards in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans”, as
permitted under a one-time election to change the method of amortization at the time of adoption of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, we have decided to switch to the straight-line method of amortizing
stock-based compensation over the vesting period of individual equity awards commencing with equity awards granted during the first quarter of 2006.

The adoption of the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation is expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of
operations. Although the actual amount of stock-based compensation expense we will recognize starting in 2006 is difficult to estimate since it involves estimating numerous assumptions, such as the number and type of stock-based awards granted in
the future, estimating our future stock price for those awards that will be granted in the future and the related assumptions used for estimating the fair values of these equity awards, such as volatility, expected life and expected forfeitures, we
currently estimate that our total annual stock-based compensation for 2006 will be significant and will likely not be less than the $32.7 million that we would have recorded in 2005 had we recognized stock-based compensation under the fair value
provisions of SFAS No. 123 as discussed above. Stock-based compensation will be reflected in our statement of operations in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the new accounting
guidance for stock-based compensation is expected to have significant ramifications to our income taxes in future periods.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

Revenues.

Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands):



Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were geographically comprised of the
following (dollars in thousands):

We recognized revenues
of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to revenues of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 35% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further
discussed below.

Our business is based on a recurring revenue
model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one
to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising greater than 90% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Historically, approximately half of our then
existing customers order new services in any given quarter representing greater than half of the new orders received in each quarter. To review our revenue recognition policies for our recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates” above.

Our non-recurring revenues
are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion
of the installation or professional services work performed. These non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than
10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to their expiration. To
review our revenue recognition policies for our non-recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above.

In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and
2) utilization. Our customer count increased to 1,138 as of December 31, 2005 versus 950 as of December 31, 2004, an increase of 20%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space
available. Our utilization rate grew to 54% as of December 31, 2005 from 45% as of December 31, 2004; however, excluding the impact of our most recent expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley area markets, our utilization rate
would have been 58% as of December 31, 2005. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our IBX centers in the eleven markets across the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. We continue to monitor
the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for some customers are
growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, we have negotiated power
consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative
impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. As a result of these power limitations in
our existing IBX centers, the maximum utilization rate that we expect to achieve for most IBX centers until we consider an IBX center full or sold-out is approximately 75-80% depending on the building configurations. Therefore, consistent with our
recent



expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets, we will continue to closely manage available space and power
capacity in each of our operating markets and expect to continue to make strategic and selective expansions to our global footprint when and where appropriate.

U.S. Revenues.

We recognized U.S. revenues of $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to
$141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $180.4 million and $134.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 34% increase. U.S. recurring revenues
consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services and, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2005, in connection with our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property, a
nominal amount of recurring rental income from the other tenants located on this property that we now own, which totaled $312,000. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $9.8 million of revenue generated from the
recently acquired Washington, D.C. area and Silicon Valley area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively. Excluding revenues from these recently acquired U.S. IBX centers, the
period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average
utilization rate as discussed above, and selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues, particularly colocation and interconnection services, to continue to remain our most significant source of revenue
for the foreseeable future.

In addition, U.S. revenues
consisted of non-recurring revenues of $11.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional
services and settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $817,000 and $609,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Offsetting some of
this non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 were service level credits that we recorded totaling $457,000 that were issued or will be issued to certain of our customers related to two separate power outages in our Chicago
and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. There were no significant service level credits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding settlements and service level credits, U.S. non-recurring revenues, consisting of the
recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services, increased 58% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year, as well as the completion of certain custom projects for the U.S.
government during the quarter ended March 31, 2005.

Asia-Pacific Revenues.

We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 34% increase.
Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $27.6 million and $20.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition,
Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $44,000 and $280,000, respectively, of
contract settlement revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 45% and 52%, respectively, of the regional
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure
service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this
region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues were $158.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16%
increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment
and security services. A



substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs,
which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth of services in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in
the future on a per unit or fixed basis in addition to on a customer growth or variable basis. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year.

U.S. Cost of Revenues.

U.S. cost of revenues
were $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included (i) $57.1 million of depreciation
expense and (ii) $1.9 million of accretion expense comprised of $504,000 for our asset retirement obligations and $1.4 million for our restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related
liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included (i) $50.1 million of depreciation expense, (ii) $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense,
(iii) $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation for our various leasehold interests and (iv) $147,000 of amortization expense associated with the intangible asset acquired with our Santa Clara IBX center
that became fully amortized in December 2004. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 also included $6.4 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently acquired
Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively plus $1.5 million of costs attributed to our three most recently acquired IBX centers in
Sunnyvale, Chicago and Los Angeles which will be available to customers in 2006. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense, amortization expense and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of
revenues increased period over period to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 5% increase. This increase is primarily the result of increasing utility costs in line
with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth partially offset by savings of approximately $1.8 million in operating costs, primarily rent, in connection with a property we recorded a restructuring charge for in
Los Angeles in December 2004. We continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues, excluding stock-based compensation, will increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase and as the costs
attributed to newly-acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas commence operations more fully in 2006. However, a portion of our expected increase in U.S. cost of revenues will be partially offset by a reduction
in rent expense as a result of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property where our primary Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center is located. We expect that this savings in rent expense will be approximately $530,000 per quarter.
However, part of the rent savings will be offset by increased depreciation of approximately $245,000 per quarter on the purchased property. In addition, any increase in U.S. cost of revenues will be offset in part from the San Jose ground lease
termination. We expect that this savings in operating costs, primarily rent and property tax expense, to be approximately $1.4 million per quarter, with partial savings of approximately $940,000 realized in the fourth quarter of 2005, although this
decrease in rent and property tax expense will be somewhat reduced by an increase in accretion expense associated with this restructuring charge, which is expected to be approximately $2.3 million for 2006. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory
expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S. cost of revenues will increase further. We expect
that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues.

Asia-Pacific
cost of revenues were $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $3.6 million of
depreciation expense and $259,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued in May 2004 to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2004 included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense.



Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $16.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005 from $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 10% increase. This increase is primarily the result of increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues
attributed to this customer growth. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX center, such as mail service
and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues, excluding stock-based compensation, will experience moderate growth in the
foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation,
our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

Sales and
Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses.

U.S. sales
and marketing expenses increased to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
$1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $60,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $60,000 of stock-based compensation expense and $59,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. The increase in the stock-based compensation expense period
over period is a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our sales and marketing executive officers in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and
marketing expenses increased to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and
related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. This increase was primarily due to approximately $1.9 million of higher compensation costs, including
increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (68 U.S. sales and
marketing employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 65 as of December 31, 2004); however, this growth was partially offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of approximately $190,000 due to a strong and
successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. Going forward, we expect to see U.S. sales and marketing spending, excluding stock-based compensation, to increase nominally in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our
business. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S.
sales and marketing expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

Asia-Pacific Sales
and Marketing Expenses.

Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in
Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.8 million of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations, which were fully amortized in December
2004. Excluding amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a nominal 3% increase. While there was an
increase of approximately $138,000 in higher compensation costs during this period, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, general salary
increases and



bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (27 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as
of December 31, 2005 versus 26 as of December 31, 2004), and an increase in related travel and entertainment costs of approximately $132,000, this growth was mostly offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of
approximately $224,000 due to a strong and successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely
compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney
and Tokyo. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, will experience some moderate growth in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based
compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will increase further. We expect that
this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

General and Administrative.

General and
administrative expenses increased to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

U.S. General and Administrative Expenses.

U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $37.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $6.7 million of stock-based compensation
expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of depreciation expense. The
increase in the stock-based compensation expense period over period is primarily a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our executive officers in the first quarter of 2005, net of forfeitures for two of
these executive officers that have left or will terminate their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to
$28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $22.7 million for the prior period, a 27% increase. This increase is primarily due to approximately $5.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary
increases, bonuses, headcount growth (152 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 126 as of December 31, 2004) and $986,000 related to accrued severance charges related to two of our officers that have left
or will terminate their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006, as well as an increase in professional fees, primarily approximately $175,000 of costs associated with the STT divestiture transaction completed in November 2005. General
and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate
headquarter office lease. Going forward, we expect U.S. general and administrative spending, excluding stock-based compensation, to increase moderately in absolute dollars as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Furthermore, as
a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S. general and administrative
expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates above.

Asia-Pacific General and Administrative
Expenses.

Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Asia-Pacific
general and administrative expenses were $284,000 and $366,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to
$7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $6.2 million for the prior period, a 21% increase. This increase is primarily due to



approximately $1.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses, as well as some headcount growth (85 Asia-Pacific
general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 72 as of December 31, 2004). Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries
and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific
headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S., such as finance, legal, marketing and information technology, also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our
Asia-Pacific operations; however, each of our Asia-Pacific locations in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo also have general and administrative staff dedicated to each specific operation. In addition to our Asia-Pacific headquarter office in Singapore, we
also have separate office locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong (the Sydney general and administrative staff work out of the Sydney IBX). We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, will
experience some moderate growth in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new
accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

Restructuring Charges.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8
million, which we refer to as the 2005 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in or near some of the four IBX centers we currently
have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision that retaining the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease for future expansion was no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this
property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease
payments through 2020. The restructuring charge consisted of (i) a $32.3 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, which is net of $4.4 million of deferred rent previously accrued
for this lease (thereby creating a total restructuring liability of $36.7 million associated with this lease) and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $1.5 million representing development costs incurred to date to prepare this land
for use. We expect, as a result of this restructuring charge, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $5.6 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million, which we refer to as the 2004 restructuring charge. In
light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of
our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any
estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms; and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess
space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles and the current
restructuring charge for these properties is based on the best available information. As a result of these restructuring charges, primarily relating to the Los Angeles property, we realized annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $1.8
million during 2005.

As of December 31, 2004, we had
total accrued restructuring charges of $14.8 million recorded as a liability on our balance sheet related to the 2004 restructuring charge described above. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we (i) recorded the $36.7 million of new
restructuring charge liability for the 2005 restructuring charge described above; (ii) recorded $1.4 million of accretion expense related to these excess leases and (iii) incurred net



cash payments of $3.1 million related to these excess leases resulting in an accrued restructuring charge liability on our balance sheet of $49.8 million as
of December 31, 2005. We are contractually committed to these excess leases through 2015. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 17 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest
Income.

Interest income increased to $3.6 million from $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and
short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2005
was 3.32% versus 1.64% for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased to $8.9 million from $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the quarter ended March 31, 2005, we
converted 95% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $38.0 million held by STT Communications into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares
of our common stock in February 2005. In addition, STT Communications converted the remaining 5% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which was
immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock in November 2005. These conversion activities resulted in a decrease in interest expense in 2005, offset in part, by interest expense associated with (i) the $35.3 million capital
lease obligation we recorded in connection with the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center during the fourth quarter of 2004, which bears interest at 8.50%; (ii) the $18.7 million financing we recorded in connection with the Silicon Valley
metro area IBX center equipment and fiber during the first quarter of 2005, which bears interest at 8.50%; (iii) the $9.7 million financing for equipment we purchased in connection with our Chicago IBX acquisition in November 2005, which bears
interest at 7.50%; (iv) the $38.1 million financing we recorded in connection with our Los Angeles IBX financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 7.75%; (v) the $60.0 million mortgage payable we recorded in connection with our
Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 8.00% and (vi) the $30.0 million drawdown from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during October 2005, which bore interest at an initial rate of 5.72%
and was fully repaid in January 2006. As a result of these new financing arrangements, we expect interest expense to increase in 2006.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion.

In February 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture
offering, we paid off the remaining $34.3 million credit facility and two other smaller debt facilities with a combined total of $2.9 million of principal remaining, as well as redeemed the remaining $30.5 million 13% senior notes that were
outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March 2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, and which had a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to
2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the
write-off of the various debt issuance costs and discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash
transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no loss recorded in connection with the STT convertible secured notes conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2005 as the STT convertible secured notes did not have a beneficial
conversion feature at the time of issuance on December 31, 2002.

Income Taxes.

A full valuation allowance is recorded against our net deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence including recurring historical losses, that
it is more likely than not that the net value of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $543,000 and $153,000, respectively, of income tax expense, primarily representing
income taxes related to alternative minimum tax and foreign jurisdictions. We have not incurred any significant income tax expense since inception and we do not expect to incur any significant income tax expense during 2006 other than alternative
minimum tax.



Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Revenues.

Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were split
between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands):

Our revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):

We recognized revenues
of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to revenues of $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 39% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further
discussed below.

Our business is based on a recurring revenue
model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as once a customer has been installed in one of our IBX centers they are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for
the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising 94% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
93% in the prior year. Historically, greater than half of our customers order new services each quarter and greater than half of our new orders come from our already installed customer base each quarter.

Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services
related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work
performed. The non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. Installation and professional services revenues increased 34% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth
during the year. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent approximately 5% of total revenues in each period. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid
to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to the expiration of their contract.

In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and
2) utilization. Our customer count increased to 950 as of December 31, 2004 versus 712 as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 33%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space
available. Our utilization rate grew to 45% as of December 31, 2004 from 35% as of December 31, 2003. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our



utilization rates vary from market to market among our 15 worldwide IBX centers. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected
markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Therefore, consistent with our lease of Sprint’s Santa Clara property in December 2003 and our expansion into the
Washington, D.C. metro area market in April 2004 and further expansion into the Silicon Valley market in December 2004, we continually review available space in our other operating markets.

U.S. Revenues.

We recognized U.S. revenues of
$141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $134.3 million and $93.6 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 43% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2004 included revenue generated from the recently acquired Santa Clara IBX center. Excluding revenue from this acquired U.S. IBX hub, the period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in
orders from both our existing customers and new customer growth acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average utilization rate as discussed above. As noted above, historically, greater than half of
our new orders come from our already installed customer base each period.

In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $7.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the
recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services. Also included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $609,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 associated with
certain contract terminations. The $609,000 in settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represented a bankruptcy court-mandated payment from Excite@Home. The $1.2 million in settlement fees for the year ended
December 31, 2003 primarily represented bankruptcy court-mandated payments from both Worldcom and Excite@Home.

Asia-Pacific Revenues.

We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $20.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, consisting primarily of
colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $1.9 million for both years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $280,000 and
$584,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo with Singapore representing approximately 52% and 77%,
respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional
managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the
customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Tokyo and Sydney; however, this revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in Singapore of approximately $3.1 million.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues were
$136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 7% increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our
leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature and do not vary
significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth of services for our existing and new customer base. Given a large
component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant



incremental flow-through to gross profit; however, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per server basis. As a result, customers are
consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. This, combined with the fact that we do not currently control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, means that our utility costs are expected to increase in the
future, and we may not be successful in raising power revenues to a sufficient level to offset such expected increases in utility costs.

U.S. Cost of Revenues.

U.S. cost of revenues were $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
$107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. cost of revenues included $50.1 million of depreciation expense, $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement
obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $147,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues included $49.9 million of
depreciation expense, $59,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $562,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $13,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible
asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense and amortization expense, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $67.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 19% increase. This increase is primarily the result of the operating costs associated with the Santa Clara IBX center acquired on
December 1, 2003, as well as increasing utility costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly-acquired Santa Clara IBX, of $4.1 million in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth and $1.2
million of higher compensation costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly-acquired Santa Clara IBX, including general salary increases and bonuses for our IBX staff.

Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues.

Asia-Pacific cost of revenues were $18.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value
attributed to warrants issued to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $4.4 million of depreciation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues decreased period over period to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, a 9% decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in bandwidth costs in Singapore associated with a corresponding decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in this location of approximately $2.4 million; (ii) a
decrease in operating costs in Singapore as a result of the asset sale of one of our two IBX centers in Singapore that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 of $804,000 and (iii) the renegotiation and reduction of our Hong Kong and Tokyo
lease costs, resulting in rent savings of approximately $538,000. These decreases are partially offset by some cost increases in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to our customer growth in this region, including
increasing utility costs in our Asia-Pacific IBX centers of $649,000. Our Asia-Pacific costs of revenues are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed IT infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our
Singapore IBX hub, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. As a result, our Singapore IBX center has a greater number of employees than any of our other IBX
centers, and therefore, a greater labor cost relative to our other IBX centers in the United States or other Asia-Pacific locations.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2004 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses.

U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included
in U.S. sales and marketing expenses were $119,000 and $299,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S.



sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $12.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, a 12% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel.
This increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs of $1.1 million, primarily as a result of growth in our revenue bookings and an increase in the number of sales and marketing headcount.

Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing
Expenses.

Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific sales
and marketing expenses were $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding
amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 down from $4.8 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of headcount and overall compensation cost
reductions in the Singapore region last year of approximately 14% and a decrease in overall discretionary spending due in large part to synergistic savings as a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002. Our Asia-Pacific sales
and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials
and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

U.S. General and Administrative Expenses.

U.S. general and administrative expenses decreased to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $28.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $1.8 million and $1.4 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively.
Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $5.3 million and $2.6 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Depreciation and stock-based compensation
expense decreased period over period as certain headquarter-based assets became fully depreciated during the year, and certain stock-based compensation costs became fully amortized. Excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, U.S.
general and administrative expenses increased to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $20.4 million for the prior year, an 11% increase. This increase is primarily due to higher professional service fees and other
legal-related costs and expenses of $1.8 million, including $733,000 of external costs attributed to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiatives. We continue to incur additional costs related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative and this
initiative will continue to impose additional costs on Equinix as a public company, both in the form of outside professional service fees for auditors and other advisors, and internal costs related to various devoted teams throughout the
organization. We also have higher overall compensation costs of $1.9 million related to annual salary merit increases and corporate bonus programs, as well as an increase in the number of new hires over the past year. In addition, during 2004, we
incurred a net charge of $190,000 related to the liquidation of certain legacy subsidiaries in Europe and we do not expect this cost to recur (we initially recorded a charge of $512,000 in the third quarter, which was offset by a reduction in the
charge of $322,000 in the fourth quarter as a result of a favorable settlement reached in December 2004). These increases in costs are partially offset by some savings related to the shutdown of the Pihana corporate office in Honolulu that was
completed in June 2003, and the relocation of the corporate headquarter office from Mountain View to Foster City in March 2003 totaling $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, consist
primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease.



Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses.

Asia-Pacific general and
administrative expenses increased to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $366,000 and
$497,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as
compared to $5.5 million for the prior year, a 13% increase. This increase is primarily related to an increase in professional service fees of $141,000 related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative in Singapore and higher compensation costs of
$450,000 as a result of annual merit increases and corporate bonus programs. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses,
accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter
office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S. also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations. In addition, we have separate office locations in Hong
Kong and Tokyo.

Restructuring
Charges.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million. In light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at that time at costs
significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los
Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms
and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease
agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles. We expect that as a result of these restructuring charges, we will realize annual savings in cost of
revenues commencing in 2005 of approximately $1.8 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had total accrued restructuring charges of $14.8 million recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet related to these excess lease spaces. For further
detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 17 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not incur any restructuring charges during the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Interest
Income.

Interest income increased to $1.3 million from $296,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term
and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as to increased yields on those balances.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased to $11.5 million from $20.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the reduction in the principal balance outstanding on our credit facility during 2003 and 2004. These interest expense savings were
partially offset by additional non-cash interest expense associated with the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued on June 5, 2003 as a result of the Crosslink financing. However, during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, with
the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding. In addition, in March 2004, the
$10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt
facilities, which have been replaced with our $86.3 million 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures, our interest expense commencing with the second quarter of 2004 was significantly reduced.



Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion.

In February 2004, with
the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March
2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, which contained a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a
result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of the various debt issuance costs and
discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no
such debt extinguishment or conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Income Taxes.

A full valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence, that it is more likely
than not that the value of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $153,000 of income tax expense, primarily representing income taxes related to our international subsidiaries.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception, we have financed our operations and capital requirements
primarily through the issuance of various debt and equity instruments, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2005, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) non-convertible debt and financing
obligations totaling $186.2 million from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, Chicago IBX equipment financing, Los Angeles IBX financing, Ashburn campus mortgage payable and a drawdown from
our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and (ii) convertible debt totaling $86.3 million from our convertible subordinated debentures as outlined below.

As of December 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was our $188.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and
short-term and long-term investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we had $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in the event we need additional cash to
pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. While we had generated negative operating cash flow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we
started to generate positive operating cash flow. Since then, we have generated cash flow from our operations throughout 2004 and 2005 and expect this trend to continue throughout 2006 and beyond. While we expect that our cash flow from operations
will continue to grow, due to our recently announced expansion plans in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to
complete these expansion projects, will also increase and are expected to be greater than our cash flows generated from operating activities. As a result, although we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from
operating activities, to meet our currently identified business objectives for at least the next twelve months, we will investigate financing opportunities in connection with our Chicago metro area expansion plans in order to minimize expected cash
outlays to pursue this project and in order to continue to meet our cash requirements to fund our other capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of our short-term and
long-term investments). However, given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our
desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Net cash provided by our operating activities was $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net
cash used in our operating activities was $17.3 million for the



year ended December 31, 2003. Since the quarter ending September 30, 2003, we have been generating cash from our operations. In prior periods, we
used cash primarily to fund our net loss, including cash interest payments on our senior notes and credit facility, although the majority of the operating cash flows used during the year ended December 31, 2003 related to the liquidation of
accrued obligations, such as accrued restructuring activities and accrued merger and financing costs. We continue to experience strong collections of our accounts receivables and as our revenues have grown at a much faster pace than our costs, which
is due to a significant portion of our costs remaining relatively flat from period to period such as rent for our existing IBX centers, the cash generated from our operations has grown period over period. As described above, we expect that we will
continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2006 and beyond.

Net cash used in investing activities was $108.7 million, $56.9 million and $49.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the year
ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of the purchases of the Los Angeles IBX and Ashburn campus properties for $34.7 million and $53.8 million, respectively, and capital expenditures required to bring our recently acquired IBX
centers in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base offset by the net sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments. Net cash used in
investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily for the net purchase of short-term and long-term investments, as well as to fund capital expenditures to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley
and Washington, D.C. metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the purchase of short-term investments and
some nominal amount of capital expenditures, partially offset by the release of restricted cash to fund a cash interest payment on our senior notes in January 2003. For 2006 and beyond, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities,
excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments, will primarily be for our capital expenditures as well as additional purchases of real estate that we may undertake in the future. In February 2006, we announced
the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project in which we will spend approximately $50.0 to $55.0 million of capital expenditures in order to build this new IBX center in one of the existing and vacant buildings on the Ashburn campus, of
which approximately $40.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2006 and which will fulfill our requirement to invest $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus
financing. Furthermore, in February 2006, we announced the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project in which we may purchase a vacant building for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. If we purchase this building, additional significant capital
expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property.

Net cash generated by financing activities was $134.6 million, $19.2 million and $52.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash generated by financing activities for
the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of proceeds of $30.0 million from our drawdown on the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in October 2005, which we repaid in full in January 2006, proceeds of $60.0
million from our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, proceeds of $38.1 million from our Los Angeles IBX financing and proceeds from the exercises of warrants and various employee stock plans, offset primarily by principal payments for our
various capital lease and other financing obligations. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, was primarily the result of the $86.3 million in gross proceeds from our convertible debenture offering,
offset by $70.8 million in payments on our credit facility, senior notes and capital lease and other financing obligations, as well as debt extinguishment costs associated with paying down these facilities and $7.3 million in proceeds from our
various employee stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the $104.4 million in net proceeds of our follow-on equity offering and $10.0 million in proceeds
from the Crosslink financing, partially offset by $57.2 million in payments on our credit facility and $6.1 million in payments on our various capital lease and other financing obligations.



Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt

As of December 31, 2005, our non-convertible debt totaled $186.2 million and was comprised of our (i) Washington
D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, (ii) San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, (iii) Chicago IBX equipment financing, (iv) Los Angeles IBX financing, (v) Ashburn campus mortgage payable and (vi) our $30.0 million
drawdown from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2005, in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown described above, we had utilized $6.7 million of the credit line through the issuance of
letters of credit, and, as a result, we had $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line.

Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease.

In April 2004, we entered into a
long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery
equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million.
Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $34.5 million remained outstanding under this capital lease.

San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber
Financing.

In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new
IBX center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements are considered to be a single
arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction are classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property
during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at
an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $15.0 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation.

Chicago IBX Equipment Financing.

In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for
a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate agreements are
considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this
property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through
August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $8.5 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation.

Los Angeles IBX Financing.

In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data
center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from
the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005 and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the
sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX
financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective
interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $38.1 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation.



Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable.

In December 2005, we completed the
financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash, which we received in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage
payable, which we refer to as the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which will commence in February 2006, will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8% per
annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $60.0 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable.

$50.0 Million Silicon Valley Bank Revolving Credit Line.

In December 2004, we entered into a $25.0 million line
of credit arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank that matured in December 2006. This facility was a $25.0 million revolving line of credit which, at our election, up to $10.0 million could have been converted into a 24-month term loan, repayable in
eight quarterly installments. We referred to this transaction as the Silicon Valley Bank credit line. Borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line bore interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime
rate or LIBOR. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line also featured sublimits, which allowed us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these
sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line was collateralized by
substantially all of our domestic assets and contained numerous covenants, including financial covenants, such as maintaining minimum cash balance levels and meeting minimum quarterly revenue targets. This line of credit remained undrawn since
inception. In September 2005, we amended the Silicon Valley Bank credit line by entering into a $50.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $25.0 million line of credit arrangement
with the same bank. The new $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line has a three-year commitment, which enables us to borrow, repay and re-borrow the full amount, up to September 15, 2008. We refer to this transaction as the
$50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Borrowings under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In
October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million from the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, which we refer to as the $30.0 million drawdown and which we paid back in full in January 2006. The $30.0 million drawdown was used to
fund a portion of the purchase of the Ashburn IBX property acquisition. As of December 31, 2005, the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line had an interest rate of 6.12% per annum. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank
revolving credit line also features sublimits, which allow us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the
effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, we had utilized $6.7 million
under the letters of credit sublimit with the issuance of five letters of credit in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown and, as a result, reduced the amount of borrowings available to us from $50.0 million to $13.3 million. The $50.0 million
Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line is collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains several financial covenants which require compliance with maximum leverage ratios, working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA
target, which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2005.

Debt
Obligations—Convertible Debt

Convertible
Secured Notes.

In December 2002, in conjunction with our acquisition of i-STT Pte Ltd, STT Communications made a $30.0 million strategic investment in us in the form of a 14% convertible secured note due November 2007.
The interest on the convertible secured note was payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes, which we referred to as “PIK notes.” During 2003 and through December 31, 2004, we had issued $8.5 million in
PIK notes. The convertible secured note and PIK notes issued to STT Communications were convertible into our preferred and common stock at a price of $9.18 per underlying share, and were convertible anytime at the option of STT Communications. Upon
certain conditions, including if the closing price of our common stock exceeded $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days, we had the option of converting the



convertible secured notes beginning in 2005. In January 2005, we exercised this right and converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and
unpaid interest totaling $38.0 million into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. We refer to this transaction as the STT convertible
secured notes conversion. In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the remaining convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million, which remained after the 95% STT convertible secured notes conversion in January
2005, into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which were then immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock.

Convertible Subordinated Debentures.

During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of
2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities, as well as
fully redeemed our remaining 13% senior notes. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February and August, which commenced August 2004. Unlike our convertible secured notes, the interest on our
convertible subordinated debentures is payable in cash. Our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock.

Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on
February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the convertible
subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock upon certain defined circumstances, including during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of $39.50 per
share of our common stock, or approximately $47.40 per share, for twenty consecutive trading days during the period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter. We may redeem all or a portion of the
debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Debt Maturities, Financings, Leases and Other Contractual Commitments

We lease our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2025. The following
represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands):

(1)

Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below.



In connection with five of our IBX operating leases, we have entered into five irrevocable letters of
credit with Silicon Valley Bank. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the letters of credit sublimit provision in connection with the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The letters of credit
total $6.7 million, are collateralized by the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration dates. If the landlords for any of these five IBX operating
leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. This contingent commitment is
not reflected in the table above.

As a result of our recent
IBX expansions in the Washington D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas, as of December 31, 2005, we were contractually committed for $20.3 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet
delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to bring these acquired IBX centers to Equinix standards prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid in 2006, is
reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitment.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the $20.3 million contractually committed as of
December 31, 2005 in these four markets during the first half of 2006 of approximately $15.0 to $25.0 million in order to complete the work needed to bring these new IBXs up to Equinix standards. This non-contractual capital expenditure
spending is not reflected in the table above. Furthermore and pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing, we have agreed to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007. This $40.0
million contractual commitment, which will be spent on our recently announced Washington, D.C. metro area expansion project and which we expect to pay during 2006, is reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitment.”
Lastly, we have other, smaller future purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2005, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S. and Singapore, through 2006 and 2007 and other open purchase orders
which contractually bind us for good or services to be delivered or provided in 2006. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2005, which total $7.1 million, are also reflected in the table above as an “other contractual
commitment.”

In February 2006, we entered into a
definitive purchase and sale agreement to purchase a vacant 228,000 square foot standalone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. The agreement is subject to numerous closing conditions, including
the satisfactory completion by us of a comprehensive due diligence review of the property. As part of the evaluation process, we are considering several partnering and financing options for building out this center and are also evaluating options to
build out this center in a phased approach. A new center would be interconnected to our downtown Chicago IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We refer to this project as the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. If we
purchase this building, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property. This subsequent event commitment is not reflected in the table above.

Summary

Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our
footprint and service offerings, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003, our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2005 expansions in the Silicon Valley, Chicago
and Los Angeles metro area markets and our 2006 announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case
with these recent expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles area markets, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to
networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors
may be attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may



require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these centers
up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, as was the case with our recent Ashburn campus property acquisition, or a long-term leasing arrangement.

In addition to our successful strategy of acquiring previously or partially
built-out centers, we are also contemplating the possibility of new construction in selective markets where the inventory for high quality data centers is limited, such as our recent announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the
Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. Decisions to build will consider factors such as customer demand, market pricing and the financial returns associated with the construction. Future purchases or construction may be completed by us or with
partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash.

As of December 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was our $188.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we had $13.3 million of additional
liquidity available to us under our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in the event we need additional cash to pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. While we had generated negative
operating cash flow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. Since then, we have generated cash flow from our operations
throughout 2004 and 2005 and expect this trend to continue throughout 2006 and beyond. While we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to grow, due to our recently announced expansion plans in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro
areas, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to complete these expansion projects, will also increase and are expected to be greater than our cash flows
generated from operating activities. As a result, although we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our currently identified business objectives for at least the next twelve
months, we will investigate financing opportunities in connection with our Chicago metro area expansion plans in order to minimize expected cash outlays to pursue this project and in order to continue to meet our cash requirements to fund our other
capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of our short-term and long-term investments). However, given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion
opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to
“Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock
options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity
classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be remeasured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained
in SFAS No. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows from operating to financing activities. In addition, in March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB
No. 107”), which offers guidance on SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive.
Key topics of SAB No. 107 include discussion on the valuation models available to preparers and guidance on key assumptions used in these valuation models, such as expected volatility and expected term, as well as guidance on accounting for the
income tax effects of SFAS No. 123(R) and disclosure considerations, among other topics.



SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 were effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however in April 2005, the SEC approved a
new rule that SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 are now effective for public companies for annual, rather than interim, periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the first quarter of 2006 will be the first period in which we
will report stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. We are currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R), including related
FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107 are expected to have a significant impact on our
financial position and results of operations. For further information on our implementation strategy of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107, refer to our discussion on
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS
No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets contained in APB Opinion No. 29 and replaces it with an
exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the provisions of SFAS No. 153 are to be applied prospectively, the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have an impact on our historical financial
statements; however, we will assess the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on any future nonmonetary transactions that we enter into, if any.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143” (“FIN No. 47”). FIN No. 47 clarifies that the term, conditional retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, refers to a legal
obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 further clarifies that the obligation to
perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement and provides guidance on how an entity might reasonably estimate the fair value of such a conditional asset retirement
obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 has not had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-6, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination” (“EITF 05-6”). EITF 05-6 addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business
combination and leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at the beginning of a lease term. EITF 05-6 states that (i) leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized
over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition and (ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service
significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably
assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. EITF 05-6 is effective for leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6 has not had a
significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-7, “Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Securities and Related Issues” (“EITF 05-7”). EITF 05-7 addresses that the change in the fair
value of an embedded conversion option upon modification should be included in the analysis under EITF Issue 96-19, “Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments,” to determine



whether a modification or extinguishment has occurred and that changes to the fair value of a conversion option affects the interest expense on the
associated debt instrument following a modification. Therefore, the change in fair value of the conversion option should be recognized upon the modification as a discount or premium associated with the debt, and an increase or decrease in additional
paid-in capital. EITF 05-7 is effective for all debt modifications in annual or interim periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-7 will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-8,
“Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a Beneficial Conversion Feature” (“EITF 05-8”). EITF 05-8 addresses that (i) the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature creates a difference between the book
basis and tax basis (“basis difference”) of a convertible debt instrument, (ii) that basis difference is a temporary difference for which a deferred tax liability should be recorded and (iii) the effect of recognizing the
deferred tax liability should be charged to equity in accordance with SFAS No. 109. EITF 05-8 is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and must be adopted through retrospective application to all
periods presented. As a result, EITF 05-8 applies to debt instruments that were converted or extinguished in prior periods as well as to those currently outstanding. The adoption of EITF 05-8 will not have a significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

In October
2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 13-1 (“FSP SFAS 13-1”), which addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with building and ground operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. The FASB
decided that such rental costs incurred during a construction period shall be recognized as rental expense. A lessee should cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The guidance in FSP SFAS 13-1 shall be applied to
the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued. A lessee shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective
date of FSP SFAS 13-1 for operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The adoption of FSP SFAS 13-1 will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as our
accounting policy for such rental costs has always been to expense such costs.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 (“FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1”), which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether
that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures
about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 amends FASB Statements No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,”
and No. 124, “Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations,” and APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1
shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. Early application is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 will have on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125.” SFAS No. 155 improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more
consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for such instruments. Specifically, SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole
(eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not
subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial



assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and (iv) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a
derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first
fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in
the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily
electricity.

In the past, we have employed foreign currency
forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash
equivalents and marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or
loss. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk
than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2005 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase by
approximately $227,000 or decrease by approximately $227,000.

An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated
with our $50.0 million revolving credit line, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, could be affected. In October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million at a one-month LIBOR
interest rate, inclusive of the applicable margin, of 5.72% per annum. Upon the one-month maturity date of the $30.0 million drawdown, we had the opportunity to either repay all or a portion of the $30.0 million drawdown, or convert the $30.0
million drawdown into a new borrowing at either the then applicable one, three or six month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin or at the prime rate. We elected to continue rolling this drawdown forward in monthly increments at the then applicable
one-month LIBOR interest rates, inclusive of the applicable margin, until such time that we decided to repay the $30.0 million drawdown in full in January 2006 at which point the effective interest rate had risen to 6.12%. Therefore, any borrowings
from our $50.0 million revolving credit line are subject to interest rate risk as evidenced by the change in interest rates from our recent $30.0 million drawdown.

The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market
value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.



These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market
value of our convertible subordinated debentures is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $98.9 million versus approximately $106.2 million
as of December 31, 2004.

Foreign Currency Risk

The majority of our recognized revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars,
generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 13% of our revenues and costs are in the Asia-Pacific region, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the
Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Going forward, we continue to expect that approximately 13-15%
of our revenues and costs will continue to be generated and incurred in the Asia-Pacific region in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the
effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future.

Commodity Price Risk

Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most
likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity at all of our locations.

In addition, as we now intend to start building new, “greenfield”
IBX centers, we will be subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment is substantial, such as
generators. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.

We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge
commodity price risk.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such



term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. There were no
significant changes in internal control over financial reporting during 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financing reporting.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein on page F-1 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Equinix, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Equinix, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Equinix, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-1


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

Equinix, Inc. (“Equinix” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1998. Equinix is the leading global provider of network-neutral data centers and Internet exchange services for enterprises,
content companies, systems integrators and network services providers. Through our Internet Business Exchange (“IBX”) centers in eleven markets in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly interconnect with every major global
network and Internet service provider for their critical peering, transit and traffic exchange requirements. These interconnection points facilitate the highest performance and growth of the Internet by serving as neutral and open marketplaces for
Internet infrastructure services, allowing customers to expand their businesses while reducing costs.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $188,855,000 of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, as of
December 31, 2005, the Company had $13,320,000 of additional liquidity available to it under the Company’s Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment in the event the Company needs additional cash to pursue attractive strategic
opportunities that may become available in the future (see Note 11). While the Company had generated negative operating cash flow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2003 the
Company started to generate positive operating cash flow. Since then, the Company has generated cash flow from its operations throughout 2004 and 2005 and expects this trend to continue throughout 2006 and beyond. While the Company expects that its
cash flow from operations will continue to grow, due to its recently announced Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion Project and Chicago Metro Area IBX Expansion Project (see Note 18), the Company expects its cash flow used in investing
activities, primarily as a result of its expected purchases of property and equipment to complete these expansion projects, will also increase and are expected to be greater than the Company’s cash flows generated from operating activities. As
a result, although the Company believes it has sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet its currently identified business objectives for at least the next twelve months, the Company will investigate
financing opportunities in connection with the Chicago Metro Area IBX Expansion Project in order to minimize expected cash outlays to pursue this project and in order to continue to meet its cash requirements to fund its other capital expenditures,
debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of our short-term and long-term investments).

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinix and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Consolidation

The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 94, “Consolidation of All Majority-Owned
Subsidiaries” and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Abstract

Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights.” As a result, all majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated unless the Company does not have control. Evidence of such a lack of effective control includes the Company’s inability to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired a Singaporean company, i-STT Pte Ltd (“i-STT”) (the “i-STT Acquisition”), and as a
result, acquired a 60% interest in its subsidiary, i-STT Nation Limited, an IBX center operation in Thailand. However, as a result of certain substantive participating rights granted to minority shareholders, i-STT Nation Limited was not considered
a controlled subsidiary and accordingly, it was not consolidated. Accordingly, the Company accounted for i-STT Nation Limited as an equity investment using the equity method of accounting. Under the purchase price allocation of i-STT, the Company
attributed no value to this investment as i-STT Nation Limited was in the early stages of operations and was not able to generate positive operating cashflow for the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company made
the decision to wind-down i-STT Nation Limited, entered into a wind-down agreement and liquidated this subsidiary. The costs of wind-down were accounted for as a purchase price adjustment consistent with EITF 95-3, “Costs to Exit an Activity of
an Acquired Company.” As of the date of the i-STT Acquisition, the Company planned to exit the Thailand business. However, because i-STT Nation Limited was not a wholly-owned subsidiary, third-party consents were required for the Company to
exit this business and since, as of the date of the i-STT Acquisition, the Company did not have such consents, the Company was unable to estimate the timing for such exit. In early 2003, the Company had several meetings with the third parties whose
consent was required to discuss the cost and timing for the Company to exit the business. The Company and the third parties reached an agreement that the Company’s maximum cost to exit this business would not exceed $650,000 and that if certain
events happened, including a reduction in i-STT Nation Limited’s operating losses over the first half of 2003, that this amount would be reduced. The exit plan specifically indentified all significant actions to be taken by the Company and the
third parties to complete the exit plan. Based on this agreement, and because the Company was uncertain as to whether i-STT Nation Limited would reduce its operating costs, in the first quarter of 2003 the Company recorded the $650,000 liability for
the estimated costs of exiting the business as a purchase price adjustment. The identified wind-down activities were completed in the second half of 2003 and the actual costs of wind-down totaled $518,000, which resulted in a further adjustment to
the purchase price in the fourth quarter of 2003 to reduce the remaining liability by $132,000.

The Company’s cumulative translation adjustment as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1,582,000, $2,349,000 and $1,202,000, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term and Long-Term Investments

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with
an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market mutual funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with financial institutions with maturities up to 90
days. Short-term investments generally consist of certificates of deposits and commercial paper with original maturities of between 90 and 360 days and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and agencies of the U.S. government
and the U.S. government. Long-term investments generally consist of debt securities of corporations, municipalities and agencies of the U.S. government and the U.S. government with maturities at the date of acquisition of greater than 360 days.
Short-term and long-term investments are classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of other
comprehensive income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company reviews its investment portfolio quarterly to determine if any securities may be other-than-temporarily impaired due to increased credit
risk, changes in industry or sector of a certain instrument or ratings downgrades.

Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments to the extent these exceed federal insurance limits and accounts receivable. Risks associated with cash, cash equivalents and short-term and
long-term investments are mitigated by the Company’s investment policy, which limits the Company’s investing to only those marketable securities rated at least A-1/P-1 and AA/Aa2 investment grade, as determined by independent credit rating
agencies.

A significant portion of the Company’s customer
base is comprised of businesses throughout the U.S. However, a portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from the Company’s Asia-Pacific operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the Company’s revenues were split
approximately 87% in the U.S. and 13% in Asia- Pacific. For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Company’s revenues were split approximately 87% in the U.S. and 13% in Asia- Pacific. For the year ended December 31, 2003 the
Company’s revenues were split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, one customer, IBM, accounted for 11%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of revenues for those years. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, this same customer accounted for 12% of accounts receivable as of both dates. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivables or revenues for the periods presented.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at the Company’s original cost or relative fair value for acquired property and
equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX center equipment and two to thirteen years for IBX center equipment. Leasehold
improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement, which is generally ten to fifteen years for the leasehold improvements, unless they are
considered integral equipment, in which case they are amortized over the lease term. Buildings owned by the Company are depreciated over their estimated useful life of the building, which is generally forty to fifty years. Pursuant to EITF Issue
05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination”, which the Company adopted in the second quarter of 2005 and which did not have a significant
impact, (i) leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the
date of acquisition and (ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that
includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased.

Asset Retirement Costs

SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” establish accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. The fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated retirement costs are capitalized and included as part of the
carrying value of the long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the Company is accreting the liability in relation to the asset retirement obligations over time and the accretion expense
is being recorded as a cost of

F-9

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

revenue. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily related to its IBX Centers, of which the majority are leased under long-term
arrangements, and, in certain cases, are required to be returned to the landlords in original condition. All of the Company’s IBX center leases have been subject to significant development by the Company in order to convert them from, in most
cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX centers. The majority of the Company IBX centers’ initial lease terms expire at various dates ranging from 2010 to 2020 and all of them have renewal options available to the Company.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded additional
asset retirement costs related to a new lease totaling $517,000 and recorded a reduction of asset retirement costs in connection with the purchase of the Ashburn Campus (see Note 2) totaling $426,000 as the Company no longer has the obligation to
return the property to it original condition now that it owns this property and has no other significant asset retirement obligations in connection with this property. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded additional
asset retirement costs related to new leases totaling $83,000. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company revised certain of its estimates used in its calculations for asset retirement costs. As a result, the Company recorded an
increase to its asset retirement obligations of $1,057,000 and increased the related long-lived assets accordingly, which the Company reflects within leasehold improvements in property and equipment. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, the Company recorded accretion expense related to its asset retirement obligations of $504,000, $355,000 and $562,000, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company is required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill balance on at least on an annual basis, which the Company performs during the
fourth quarter. This impairment review involves a two-step process as follows:

Step 1—The Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill of each of those units. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds
the unit’s fair value, the Company moves on to step 2. If a unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.

Step 2—The Company performs an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and
non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit’s goodwill. The Company then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the
reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess.

During the three months ended December 31, 2005, the Company performed
its annual test for goodwill impairment as required by SFAS No. 142. Equinix currently operates in one reportable segment, but has determined that it operates in a number of reporting units for the purposes of SFAS No. 142. The Company
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of its Singapore reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit, including goodwill. The primary methods used to determine the fair values for SFAS No. 142 impairment
purposes were the discounted cash flow and market methods. The assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow method, including the discount rate, which was assumed to be 14%, were determined using the Company’s best estimates as of the date
of the impairment review.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net, consisted of the following as of December 31 (in
thousands):

The Company’s
goodwill is fully attributed to the Company’s Singapore operation and is an asset denominated in Singapore dollars. As a result, it is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency translation gains and losses
are a component of other comprehensive income and loss.

Other
identifiable intangible assets, comprised of customer contracts, tradename and workforce, are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization, and were acquired as a result of the i-STT Acquisition and the Santa Clara IBX Acquisition (see Note 2).
The Company amortizes these other identifiable intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are two years for customer contracts acquired in the i-STT Acquisition and five years for customer contracts acquired in the
Santa Clara IBX Acquisition and one year for both tradename and workforce. Other intangible assets, net, are included in other assets on the accompanying balances sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
recorded $60,000, $2,049,000 and $2,106,000, respectively, of amortization expense associated with its other intangible assets. The Company’s remaining intangible asset is expected to be fully amortized by 2008. The Company expects to record
amortization expense through 2008 as follows (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value amounts of the Company’s
financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term obligations, including the Mortgage Payable (see Note 5), approximate their fair value
due to either the short-term maturity or the prevailing interest rates of the related instruments. The fair value of the Company’s Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were issued in February 2004, are based on quoted market prices (see
Note 9). The estimated fair value of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures was approximately $98.9 million and $106.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

The Company accounts for impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company wrote-down the value of some property and equipment, primarily leasehold improvements, located in excess lease spaces that the Company exited from or intends to exit from and that do not currently provide any ongoing benefit (see Note 17).

In light of a number of factors, including the continued
difficulty in the economy and the Company’s significant losses to date, an impairment assessment was undertaken of the Company’s IBX centers as of December 31, 2002. This assessment involved an assessment of the future net cash flows
generated by each IBX center over their respectful useful lives and comparing this against the carrying value of that IBX center. The revenue and cost assumptions used in this analysis were based on numerous factors, including the current revenue
and cost performance of each IBX hub, historical growth rates, the remaining space to fill each IBX center to full capacity relative to the market demand in each of the individual geographic markets of each IBX hub, expected inflation rates and any
other available economic indicators and factors that the Company believed were relevant. This analysis showed that the total of the undiscounted future cash flows was greater than the carrying amount of the assets, and accordingly, no impairment was
deemed to have occurred. Significant judgments and assumptions were required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, customer growth and the timing of overall
market growth and the Company’s percentage of that market. The Company has reviewed this analysis annually as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and updated it appropriately to add new IBX centers that the Company has acquired (see Note
2) and noted that the Company had generally performed better in all significant aspects compared to the projections used in the prior year and that no impairment indicators or triggering events were present. As a result, no further impairment
analysis was performed; however, if future results do not match these estimates, revised future forecasts could result in a material adverse effect on the assessment of the Company’s long-lived assets, thereby requiring the Company to write
down the assets.

Revenue Recognition

Equinix derives more than 90% of its revenues from recurring revenue
streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation services, such as from the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection services, such as cross connects and Equinix Exchange ports; (3) managed infrastructure services,
such as Equinix Direct, bandwidth, mail service and managed platform solutions and (4) other services consisting of rent from non-IBX space. The remainder of the Company’s revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as from the
recognized portion of deferred installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally one to
three years for IBX space customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the related contract or expected customer relationship.
Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process as long as they meet the criteria for separate recognition under EITF Abstract No. 00-21, “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Revenue from bandwidth and equipment is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with EITF Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, primarily
because the Company

F-12


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

acts as the principal in the transaction, takes title to products and services and bears inventory and credit risk. To the extent the Company does not meet
the criteria for gross basis accounting for bandwidth and equipment revenue, the Company records the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized on a cash basis when no remaining performance obligations exist to
the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized.

The Company occasionally guarantees certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, the Company reduces revenue for any credits given to the
customer as a result. The Company generally has the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these credits have generally not been significant; however, during the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a total of $457,000 in service level credits to various customers primarily in connection with two separate power outages that affected the Company’s Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX
centers.

Revenue is recognized only when the service has been
provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order
prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. The Company assesses collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. The Company generally does not request
collateral from its customers although in certain cases the Company obtains a security interest in a customer’s equipment placed in its IBX centers or obtains a deposit. If the Company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably
assured, the Company defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In addition, Equinix also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for those customers that the Company had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition of Equinix’s customers were to deteriorate or if they become
insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the Company’s reserves. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount of a particular invoice value
is provided for certain problematic customer balances. A general reserve is established for all other accounts based on the age of the invoices. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of
collection is not probable.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method

.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized
in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning strategies in each of the jurisdictions in which
the Company operates. The Company also accounts for any income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” through December 31, 2005. As permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company used the intrinsic value-based method of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” to account for its employee stock-based compensation plans through December 31, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense was based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the fair
value of the Company’s shares and the exercise price of the option. Unearned deferred compensation resulting from employee option grants and restricted shares was amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual
options, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans” (“FASB Interpretation No. 28”).

Primarily as a result of employee stock options being granted at exercise
prices below fair market value prior to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in August 2000, the Company recorded a deferred stock-based compensation charge on its balance sheet of $54,537,000 in 2000, which was amortized
over the four-year vesting life of these individual stock options net of the reversal of any previously recorded accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeitures of those stock options prior to vesting. The amortization of the
deferred stock-based compensation related to these pre-IPO stock options ended in August 2004. In addition, in September 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors awarded a stock option grant to the Company’s chief executive
officer at a 15% discount to the then fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and, as a result, recorded a $1,093,000 deferred stock-based compensation charge, which is amortized over the three-year vesting period
of this grant. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $43,000 of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized, primarily for this grant to the Company’s chief executive officer. The Company expects stock-based
compensation expense related to this specific option grant to impact its results of operations through 2006. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Stock-Based Compensation” in Note 12.

In February 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved the issuance of 320,500 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers pursuant to the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates to
certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for changes in the market price
of the Company’s common stock until the restricted shares become vested. On the date of grant of the restricted shares in February 2005, the Company recorded a $14,387,000 deferred stock-based compensation charge. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a reduction in deferred stock-based compensation of $3,310,000 as a result of a declining stock price and forfeitures and recorded $6,428,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to these
restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4,649,000 of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to these restricted shares. The Company expects
stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares to impact its results of operations through 2008.

The following table presents, by operating expense, the Company’s amortization of stock-based compensation expense (in thousands):

The Company’s
fair value calculations for employee grants were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31:

The weighted-average
fair value of stock options per share on the date of grant was $24.61, $19.48 and $3.91 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company’s fair value calculations for employee’s stock purchase rights
under the Purchase Plan (see Note 12) were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions consistent with those used for employee grants as indicated above; however, the assumption for expected life (in years)
used for the Purchase Plan was approximately 1.25 years for each of the periods presented.

Commencing with the first quarter of 2006, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements, which are expected to have a significant impact to the Company (see
“Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below).

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in
equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The primary difference between net income (loss) and comprehensive
income (loss) for Equinix results from foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.

The financial position of foreign subsidiaries is translated using the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, while income and expense items
are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are included as

F-15

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

other comprehensive income or loss. The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in net income (loss) in the period
incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented. Certain inter-company balances are designated as long term. Accordingly, exchange gains and losses associated with these long-term inter-company balances are recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income (loss), along with translation adjustments.

Net Loss Per Share

The Company computes net
loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share;” SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 98; EITF Issue 03-6, “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FASB 128” and EITF
Issue 04-8 “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 128, SAB No. 98 and EITF Issues 03-6 and 04-8, basic and diluted net loss per share are computed
using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Options, warrants and contingently convertible instruments were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share. Under EITF Issue 03-6, the Company’s preferred stock
qualified as a participating security, but was not included in the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share calculations as the holder of preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. In
addition, under EITF 04-8, the Company’s Convertible Subordinated Debentures qualify as contingently convertible instruments; however, they were not included in the Company’s diluted net loss per share calculations because to do so would
be anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company follows SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through the statement of operations. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had not entered into any hedging activities; however, the
Convertible Subordinated Debentures that were issued in February 2004 contain one remaining embedded derivative, which had a zero fair value as of December 31, 2005 (see Note 9).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS
No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be remeasured each period. SFAS No. 123(R)
retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS No. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows from operating to financing
activities. In addition, in March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), which offers guidance on SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the
implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive. Key topics of SAB No. 107 include discussion on the valuation models available to preparers and guidance on key assumptions used in these
valuation models, such as expected volatility and expected term, as well as guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of SFAS No. 123(R) and disclosure considerations, among other topics. SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 were
effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however in April 2005, the SEC approved a new rule that SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 are now effective for public companies for annual, rather than interim, periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the first quarter of 2006 will be the first period in which the Company will report stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. The Company is currently
considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), including
related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107 are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company has selected the
modified prospective application method and, as a result, will not restate any prior financial statements. In addition, the Company has selected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value for both stock options and its
employee stock purchase plan and a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate fair value for new restricted stock awards issued after January 1, 2006 that contain both a service period and market price condition. Furthermore, the Company has decided to
switch to the straight-line method of amortizing stock-based compensation over the vesting period of individual equity awards issued after January 1, 2006 in conjunction with its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), which is allowed as a one-time
election at the time of adoption. Partially as a result SFAS No. 123(R), the Company has elected to reduce the contractual life of all new stock option grants, commencing with grants in the fourth quarter of 2005, from ten years to seven years.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets contained in
APB Opinion No. 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are expected to
change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the provisions of SFAS No. 153 are to be applied prospectively, the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will
not have an impact on the Company’s historical financial statements; however, the Company will assess the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on any future nonmonetary transactions that it enters into, if any.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN No. 47”). FIN No. 47 clarifies that the term, conditional retirement obligation, as used in SFAS
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be
within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 further clarifies that the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement and provides guidance on
how an entity might reasonably estimate the fair value of such a conditional asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 has not had a significant
impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination” (“EITF
05-6”). EITF 05-6 addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination and leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at the beginning of a lease term.
EITF 05-6 states that (i) leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be
reasonably assured at the date of acquisition and (ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful
life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. EITF 05-6 is effective for leasehold improvements that are purchased or
acquired in reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6 has not had a significant impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-7, “Accounting for
Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Securities and Related Issues” (“EITF 05-7”). EITF 05-7 addresses that the change in the fair value of an embedded conversion option upon modification should be included in the
analysis under EITF Issue 96-19, “Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments,” to determine whether a modification or extinguishment has occurred and that changes to the fair value of a conversion option
affects the interest expense on the associated debt instrument following a modification. Therefore, the change in fair value of the conversion option should be recognized upon the modification as a discount or premium associated with the debt, and
an increase or decrease in additional paid-in capital. EITF 05-7 is effective for all debt modifications in annual or interim periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-7 will not have a significant impact on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-8, “Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a Beneficial Conversion Feature” (“EITF 05-8”). EITF 05-8 addresses that (i) the

F-18


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

recognition of a beneficial conversion feature creates a difference between the book basis and tax basis (“basis difference”) of a convertible debt
instrument, (ii) that basis difference is a temporary difference for which a deferred tax liability should be recorded and (iii) the effect of recognizing the deferred tax liability should be charged to equity in accordance with SFAS
No. 109. EITF 05-8 is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and must be adopted through retrospective application to all periods presented. As a result, EITF 05-8 applies to debt instruments that
were converted or extinguished in prior periods as well as to those currently outstanding. The adoption of EITF 05-8 will not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 13-1 (“FSP
SFAS 13-1”), which addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with building and ground operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. The FASB decided that such rental costs incurred during a construction period
shall be recognized as rental expense. A lessee should cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The guidance in FSP SFAS 13-1 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005.
Early adoption is permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued. A lessee shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1 for operating lease arrangements entered
into prior to the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The adoption of FSP SFAS 13-1 will not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows as the Company’s accounting policy for such rental
costs has always been to expense such costs.

In November 2005,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 (“FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1”), which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the
measurement of an impairment loss. FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been
recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 amends FASB Statements No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and No. 124, “Accounting for
Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations,” and APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 shall be applied to the first
reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 will have on its financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

In February 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125.” SFAS No. 155 improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that
eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for such instruments. Specifically, SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate
the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS
No. 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and (iv) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a
derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments

acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

2.    IBX Acquisitions and Expansions

Santa Clara IBX Acquisition

In December 2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sublease an already constructed 160,000 square foot data center in Santa Clara,
California, and acquire certain related assets from Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”). The Company refers to this transaction as the Santa Clara IBX acquisition (the “Santa Clara IBX Acquisition”).

As a result of the Santa Clara IBX Acquisition, the Company recorded the
following assets and liabilities as of December 1, 2003 (in thousands):

The sublease with
Sprint, which expires in 2014, has payment terms which based on the findings of an independent valuation appraisal were at a premium to prevailing market rates for similar properties at the time of the Santa Clara IBX Acquisition. As a result, the
Company recorded an unfavorable lease liability of $4,060,000, which will be amortized into rent expense over the term of this sublease. In addition, the Company recorded both a use tax and asset retirement obligation liability in connection with
this property.

Pursuant to the terms of the sublease agreement
with Sprint, the Company obtained title to certain fixed assets contained within this IBX hub, which had a total fair value of $3,980,000. Concurrent with the negotiations with Sprint to sublease the property and take over the operations of this IBX
hub, the Company also negotiated with the various customers already located within this IBX center and entered into new contracts with the key customers. The Company also hired a number of Sprint employees that were working within this IBX center.
The customer contracts intangible asset has a useful life of five years, the term of the primary key customer contract, and the workforce intangible asset has a useful life of one year.

Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion

In April 2004, the Company entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. This center is
adjacent to the Company’s existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located within the building, is classified as a capital lease (the “Washington, D.C.
Metro Area IBX Capital Lease”). The Company took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35,309,000. Monthly
payments under this lease,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

which commenced in November 2004, will be made through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum (see Note 5). The Company refers to
this transaction as the “Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion.”

San Jose IBX Acquisition

In December 2004,
the Company entered into a series of agreements with Abovenet Communications, Inc. (“Abovenet”), including 1) a long-term lease through May 2020 for a 103,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area, 2) an asset purchase
agreement to purchase the assets located within this facility, primarily IBX plant and machinery, and 3) an agreement to interconnect all three of its IBX centers in the Silicon Valley through redundant dark fiber links through May 2020, which the
Company is managing to allow customers in each center to leverage the benefits of directly interconnecting with other customers in the other centers (collectively, the “San Jose IBX Acquistion”). Payments due to Abovenet for the San Jose
IBX Acquisition total $38,379,000, of which $4,224,000 was paid in several upfront lump-sum payments and the remaining $34,155,000 will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in February 2005, through May 2020.

The Company has accounted for the San Jose IBX Acquisition as a single
accounting arrangement with multiple elements. As a result, the Company assessed the fair value of each of the individual elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each individual element. The Company determined that the building
component of the San Jose IBX Acquisition is a long-term operating lease (the “San Jose IBX Building Operating Lease”) and the equipment purchase and fiber lease portions of the transaction are financed assets (the “San Jose IBX
Equipment & Fiber Financing”). The Company took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation liability,
totaling $18,713,000. Payments under the San Jose IBX Equipment & Fiber Financing will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. Payments under the San Jose IBX Building Operating Lease will
also be made monthly through May 2020 and total $7,381,000 in cumulative lease payments.

Sunnyvale IBX Acquisition

In June 2005, the Company entered into a long-term lease for a 120,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area (the “Sunnyvale IBX Acquisition”). This center will be interconnected to the Company’s three other
Silicon Valley area IBX centers through redundant dark fiber links that will be managed by the Company to allow customers in each center to leverage the benefits of directly interconnecting with other customers in the other centers. Payments under
this lease, which qualifies as an operating lease, total $45,255,000, which will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in October 2005 and will be payable through September 2020 (the “Sunnyvale IBX Lease”). The Company intends
to begin placing customers in this IBX center in mid-2006.

Chicago IBX
Acquisition

In July 2005, the Company entered into a
(i) long-term sublease of a 107,000 square foot data center in the Chicago metro area and (ii) an asset purchase agreement to purchase the IBX plant and machinery assets located within this new IBX center with Verio, Inc.
(“Verio”) (the “Chicago IBX Acquisition”). This center is in the same building as the Company’s existing Chicago IBX center, which it will be interconnected to in order to leverage existing networks and customers. Payments
due to Verio for the Chicago IBX Acquisition total $25,160,000, of which $1,900,000 was paid in two lump-sum payments during 2005 and the remaining $23,260,000 will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in November 2005 and and will be
payable through August 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company has accounted for the Chicago IBX Acquisition as a single accounting arrangement with
multiple elements. As a result, the Company assessed the fair value of each of the individual elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each individual element. The Company determined that the building component of the Chicago IBX
Acquisition is a long-term operating lease (the “Chicago IBX Building Operating Lease”) and the equipment purchase portion of the transaction represent financed assets (the “Chicago IBX Equipment Financing”). The Company took
possession of this property and took title to the equipment in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation liability, totaling $9,669,000 at that time. Payments under the Chicago IBX Equipment
Financing will be made monthly, which commenced November 2005 and and will be payable through August 2015, at an effective interest rate of approximately 7.50% per annum. Payments under the Chicago IBX Building Operating Lease will also be made
in monthly installments, which commenced in November 2005 and and will be payable through August 2015, and total approximately $11,670,000 in cumulative lease payments. The Company intends to begin placing customers in this IBX center in the first
half of 2006.

Los Angeles IBX Acquisition

In September 2005, the Company purchased a 107,000 square foot data center
in the Los Angeles metro area, which is comprised of the building, building improvements and land for a total purchase price, including closing costs, of $34,748,000, which the Company paid for in full with cash in September 2005 (the “Los
Angeles IBX Acquisition”). This center will be interconnected by dark fiber to the Company’s existing two IBX centers in the downtown Los Angeles area. The Company assessed the fair value of the building, building improvements and land
elements of the Los Angeles IBX acquisition and then assigned the relative fair value to each element. In October 2005, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38,700,000 and to lease it back from the
purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease (the “Los Angeles IBX Sale-Leaseback”). The Los Angeles IBX Sale-Leaseback closed in December 2005 and the Company received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38,142,000. However, due to
our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the Los Angeles IBX Sale-Leaseback does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of this
property (the “Los Angeles IBX Financing”). Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX Financing, the Company recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38,142,000 in December 2005, which includes a residual property value of $6,555,000 (the
“Residual Property Value”). The Residual Property Value represents a deferred gain on the Los Angeles Sale-Leaseback. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX Financing will be made monthly, commencing January 2006 through December 2025, at an
effective interest rate of approximately 7.75% per annum. The Company intends to begin placing customers in this IBX center in mid-2006.

Pursuant to the terms of the Los Angeles IBX Sale-Leaseback, the Company has agreed to make certain pre-approved capital improvements to this property by
December 21, 2007, which the Company anticipates will cost approximately $14,000,000, of which $3,700,000 was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 (the “Required Capital Expenditure Spending for the New Los Angeles IBX”) (see Note
14). The Company expects to spend the remaining Required Capital Expenditure Spending for the New Los Angeles IBX during 2006.

Ashburn Campus Property Acquisition

In October 2005, the Company purchased an office/warehouse complex known as the Beaumeade Business Park located in Ashburn, Virginia (the “Ashburn
Campus”). The Company purchased the entire 32.6-acre Ashburn Campus containing six buildings with approximately 462,000 rentable square feet that was approximately 95% leased at the time of purchase (the “Ashburn Campus Property
Acquisition”). The Company currently occupies approximately 269,000 square feet within three of the buildings. The total purchase price for

F-22

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the Ashburn Campus, including closing costs, was $53,759,000, which the Company paid for in full with cash in October 2005. The Company will continue to
operate its existing IBX centers within the Ashburn Campus. For those buildings that the Company does not occupy, it will collect rental income from the current tenants and are evaluating these buildings in regards to its future expansion plans. The
Company assessed the fair value of the building, building improvements and land elements of the Ashburn Campus Property Acquisition and then assigned the relative fair value to each element.

In December 2005, the Company financed the Ashburn Campus Property
Acquisition with a Mortgage Payable (see Note 5).

3.    Balance Sheet Components

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-Term Investments

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):

The original
maturities of all short-term investments were less than one year as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The original maturities of all long-term investments was greater than one year and less than two years with the exception of one long-term
investment totaling $1,917,000 and $3,164,000, which had an original maturity of greater than two years and less than three years, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, cash equivalents included
investments in other securities with various contractual maturity dates that did not exceed 90 days. Gross realized gains and losses from the sale of securities classified as available-for-sale were not material for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities is based upon specific identification.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, unrealized gains and losses were net losses of $456,000 and $92,000, respectively.

F-23


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s net unrealized losses in its available-for-sale
securities was comprised of the following (in thousands):

The Company reviews
its investment portfolio to determine if any securities may be other-than-temporarily impaired due to increased credit risk, changes in industry or sector of a certain instrument or ratings downgrades. The securities held at December 31, 2005
were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain marketable securities carried unrealized losses, the Company expects that it will receive both principal and interest according to the stated terms of each of the securities and that the
decline in market value is due to changes in the interest rate environment from the time the securities were purchased as compared to interest rates at December 31, 2005.

There were eleven marketable securities which carried an unrealized loss for longer than twelve months. The net unrealized
loss of these instruments was $179,000. These eleven securities have an aggregate fair value of $16,365,000 and were comprised of three corporate bonds rated AA or better, and eight government agency securities which carry a rating of AAA. There
were thirty-one marketable securities which carried an unrealized loss less than twelve months. The net unrealized loss of these instruments was $284,000. These securities have an aggregate fair value of $70,089,000, and were comprised of
asset-backed securities rated AAA, corporate bonds rated AA or better, commercial paper rated A-1/P-1 or better, government agency securities and U.S. treasuries both of which carry a rating of AAA.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s net unrealized losses in its
available-for-sale securities was comprised of the following (in thousands):

As of
December 31, 2004, there were no individual marketable securities which carried an unrealized loss for the past twelve consecutive months; however, there were seven marketable securities which carried an unrealized loss for at least six months.
The net unrealized losses of these seven instruments was $51,000. These seven debt instruments had an aggregate fair value of $16,042,000 and were comprised of four corporate bonds rated AA or better, and three government agency securities. The
Company had evaluated the credit risk of the securities which carried unrealized losses for six or more consecutive months. The credit risk of these instruments had not been adversely affected by a ratings downgrade and there had been no negative
impact relating to the industry or sector of the issuers of these instruments. The government agency securities had continued to trade at consistent spreads over the past year, providing further indication that there had been no negative impact to
these securities. The credit ratings of these securities remained within the Company’s

F-24


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

investment policy guidelines. Based upon this evaluation, the Company had determined that the unrealized losses were predominantly the result of rising
interest rates relative to rates at the time the securities were purchased in the first half of 2004. This decline in value of these investments was primarily related to changes in interest rates and was considered to be temporary in nature, and as
a result, the Company had continued to account for these as unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net, consists of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):

Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Unearned revenue consists of pre-billing for services that have not yet been provided, but which have been billed to customers ahead of time in accordance with the terms of
their contract. Accordingly, the Company invoices its customers at the end of a calendar month for services to be provided the following month.

Additions (reductions) to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately ($464,000), ($50,000) and zero for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Charges (recoveries) against the allowance were approximately ($272,000), ($72,000) and $82,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is comprised of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):

Leasehold
improvements, IBX plant and machinery, IBX equipment, buildings and computer equipment and software recorded under capital leases aggregated $35,309,000 as of both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amortization on the assets recorded
under capital leases is included in depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation on such assets totaled $2,354,000 and $119,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, repectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company recorded $62,620,000, $55,926,000 and $60,080,000, respectively, of total depreciation expense. The Company recorded substantial property and equipment assets during 2005 in connection with various IBX acquisitions and expansions (see Note

Company wrote-off all remaining property and equipment, primarily leasehold improvements, in connection with the Company’s San Jose Ground Lease totaling $1,486,000. In December 2004, the Company wrote-off all remaining property and equipment,
primarily leasehold improvements, located in the excess lease space on the floor above the Company’s Los Angeles IBX totaling $3,816,000. The Company decided to exit from both of these excess lease spaces and these assets do not provide any
ongoing benefit (see Note 17).

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the
following as of December 31 (in thousands):

In February 2005, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the Company’s 2005 Cash Incentive Plan (“Cash Incentive Plan”). The Cash Incentive Plan applied to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005. All regular and full-time
employees, excluding sales personnel, were eligible to earn annual cash bonuses under the plan. The adoption of the Cash Incentive Plan represents the first time that the Company has adopted a formal bonus plan, resulting in an increase to accrued
employee compensation and benefits. In January 2006, the 2006 Incentive Plan was adopted to cover cash bonuses for employees for the 2006 fiscal year.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had also recorded $986,000 of severance in connection with two of our executive officers that have left or will
terminate their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006 (see “Employment Agreements” in Note 14).

The Company currently
leases the majority of its IBX centers and certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring through 2025. The centers’ lease agreements typically provide for base rental rates that increase at defined intervals during
the term of the lease. In addition, the Company has negotiated rent expense abatement periods to better match the phased build-out of its centers. The Company accounts for such abatements and increasing base rentals using the straight-line method
over the life of the lease. The difference between the straight-line expense and the cash payment is recorded as deferred rent.

4.    Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations

Capital lease and other financing obligations consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):

Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX
Capital Lease

In November 2004, the Company recorded the
Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease (see Note 2). Monthly payments under the Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease, which commenced in November 2004, will be made through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per
annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $34,530,000 remained outstanding.

San Jose IBX Equipment & Fiber Financing

In February 2005, the Company recorded the San Jose IBX Equipment & Fiber Financing (see Note 2). Monthly payments under the San Jose IBX Equipment & Fiber Financing, which commenced in February 2005, will be made through

Chicago IBX Equipment Financing

In November 2005, the Company recorded the Chicago IBX Equipment Financing (see Note 2). Monthly payments under the Chicago
IBX Equipment Financing, which commenced in November 2005, will be made through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $8,582,000 remained outstanding.

outstanding.

Venture Leasing Loan Agreement and VLL Loan Amendment

In August 1999, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement
with Venture Lending & Leasing II, Inc. and other lenders (“VLL” and the “Venture Leasing Loan Agreement”). The Venture Leasing Loan Agreement provided financing for equipment and tenant improvements at the Newark, New
Jersey IBX center and a secured term loan facility for general working capital purposes. The amount of financing provided was up to $10,000,000, which was allowed to be used to finance up to 85% of the projected cost of tenant improvements and
equipment for the Newark IBX center. The full $10,000,000 was fully drawn during 1999. Notes issued bore interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and were repayable in 42 monthly installments plus a final balloon interest payment equal to 15% of
the original advance amount due at maturity and are collateralized by the assets of the Newark, New Jersey IBX. The Venture Leasing Loan Agreement had an effective interest rate of 14.7% per annum.

In connection with the Venture Leasing Loan Agreement, the Company granted
VLL warrants to purchase 9,375 shares of the Company’s common stock at $96.00 per share (the “VLL Warrants”). These warrants were immediately exercisable and were set to expire on June 30, 2006. The fair value of the warrant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: deemed fair market value per share of $153.60, dividend yield 0%, expected volatility of 80%, risk-free interest rate of 5.0% and a contractual life of seven years, was
$1,174,000. Such amount was recorded as a discount to the applicable debt, and was being amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the life of the agreement.

In October 2002, the Company amended the Venture Leasing Loan Agreement to
secure certain short-term cash deferment benefits (the “VLL Loan Amendment”). Under the original terms of the Venture Leasing Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $10,000,000 which was repayable over 42 months at 8.5% per annum plus a
15% balloon interest payment calculated on the original advance amount. Under the terms of the VLL Loan Amendment, the Company extended the maturity of the loan by 24 months. Commencing January 1, 2003, the Company re-amortized the remaining
principal balance and related balloon interest payment over the amended 27-month period ending March 1, 2005. The VLL Loan Amendment had an effective interest rate of approximately 14.7% per annum.

In connection with the VLL Loan Amendment, the Company granted VLL warrants
to purchase 32,187 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.32 per share (the “VLL Loan Amendment Warrants”) and repriced the original remaining VLL Warrants, issued in August 1999, to have an exercise price of $0.32 versus the
original $96.00 per share (the “Amended and Restated Original VLL Warrants”). Both the VLL Loan Amendment Warrants and the Amended and Restated Original VLL Warrants were immediately exercisable and the VLL Loan Amendment Warrants expire
on October 11, 2007 and the Amended and Restated Original VLL

F-28


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Warrants expire on the original expiration date of June 30, 2006. The fair value of the VLL Loan Amendment Warrants using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was approximately $220,000 with the following assumptions: fair market value per share of $7.04, dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility of 100%, risk-free interest rate of 4.0% and a contractual life of five years. Such
amount was recorded as a discount to the applicable debt based upon the guidance of APB Opinion No. 14 and was amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the remaining life of the VLL Loan Amendment. Following the
modification of the Amended and Restated Original VLL Warrants, an additional charge of approximately $45,000 was recorded as an additional debt discount representing the difference between the fair value of the modified option determined in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and the value of the old warrants immediately before its terms were modified.

In March 2004, with the proceeds from the Convertible Subordinated Debentures (see Note 9), the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the VLL Loan
Amendment, including $749,000 of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and terminated the VLL Loan Amendment. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $170,000, comprised of the write-off of
unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount totaling $74,000 and other transaction fees of $96,000. Refer to Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion (see Note 10).

Heller Loan and Heller Loan Amendment

In June 2001, the Company obtained a $5,000,000 loan from Heller Financial Leasing, Inc. (the “Heller Loan”), which was fully drawn down at that
time. Repayments on the Heller Loan were made over 36 months and interest accrued at 13.0% per annum. The Heller Loan was secured by certain equipment located in the New York metropolitan area IBX center.

In connection with the Heller Loan, the Company granted Heller Financial
Leasing, Inc. a warrant to purchase 1,171 shares of the Company’s common stock at $128.00 per share (the “Heller Warrant”). This warrant was immediately exercisable and expires in five years from the date of grant. The fair value of
the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $18,000 with the following assumptions: fair market value per share of $36.16, dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility of 80%, risk-free interest rate of 5% and a contractual life of
five years. Such amount was recorded as a discount to the applicable loan amount, and was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, over the life of the loan.

In August 2002, the Company amended the Heller Loan to secure certain short-term cash deferment benefits (the “Heller
Loan Amendment”). Under the terms of the Heller Loan Amendment, the Company extended the maturity of the loan by nine months. Commencing September 2002, the Company began to benefit from the reduction in monthly payments over the following 14
months thereby deferring approximately $1,200,000 of principal payments. Commencing November 2003, the deferred principal payments began to be repaid over the remaining 17 months of the loan ending March 2005. The Heller Loan Amendment had an
effective interest rate of approximately 16.5% per annum.

In February 2004, with the proceeds from the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Heller Loan Amendment, including $2,177,000 of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and
terminated the Heller Loan Amendment. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $267,000, comprised of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount totaling $87,000 and other
transaction fees of $180,000. Refer to Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion (see Note 10).

Maturities

Combined aggregate maturities for future minimum capital lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

5.    Mortgage
Payable

In December 2005, the Company financed the Ashburn
Campus Property Acquisition (see Note 2) with a $60,000,000, 8% mortgage to be amortized over 20 years (the “Mortgage Payable”). Upon closing the Mortgage Payable, the Company received $60,000,000 in cash proceeds and recorded a
$60,000,000 mortgage payable at that time. Payments for the Mortgage Payable are payable monthly, which commenced February 2006, and will be payable through January 2026. The Mortgage Payable is collateralized by the Ashburn Campus property and
related assets. Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Payable, the Company has agreed to invest at least $40,000,000 in capital improvements to the Ashburn Campus by December 31, 2007 (see Note 14). The Mortgage Payable has numerous covenants;
however, there are no specific financial ratio or minimum operating performance covenants. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in connection with the Mortgage Payable.

The costs incurred related to the Mortgage Payable were capitalized and are
being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Mortgage Payable. These debt issuance costs, net of amortization, were $655,000 as of December 31, 2005.

The Company’s future payment obligations for the Mortgage Payable as of
December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

6.    Senior Notes

On December 1, 1999, the Company issued 200,000 units, each consisting of a $1,000 principal amount 13% Senior Note due
2007 (the “Senior Notes”) and one warrant to purchase 0.527578 shares (for an aggregate of 105,515 shares) of common stock for $0.2144 per share (the “Senior Note Warrants”), for aggregate net proceeds of $193,400,000, net of
offering expenses. Of the $200,000,000 gross proceeds, $16,207,000 was allocated to additional paid-in capital for the deemed fair value of the Senior Note Warrants and recorded as a discount to the Senior Notes. The discount on the Senior Notes was
being amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the life of the debt. The Senior Notes had an effective interest rate of 14.1% per annum. The fair value attributed to the Senior Note Warrants was consistent with
the Company’s treatment of its other common stock transactions prior to the issuance of the Senior Notes. The fair value was based on recent equity transactions by the Company at the time.

Interest was payable semi-annually, in arrears, on June 1 and
December 1 of each year. The notes were unsecured, senior obligations of the Company and were effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company, whether or not secured.

The Senior Notes were governed by the Indenture dated December 1, 1999,
between the Company, as issuer, and State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (the “Senior Note Indenture”). Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Note Indenture restricted, among other things, the
Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom, pay dividends, incur certain liens to secure indebtedness or engage in merger transactions.

During the first half of 2002, the Company retired $52,751,000 of Senior Notes plus forgiveness of $785,000 of accrued and
unpaid interest thereon in exchange for 499,565 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $18,351,000 based on the actual exchange dates of the Senior Notes and $2,511,000 of cash. The Company wrote-off a proportionate amount of
unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with these Senior Notes totaling $1,293,000 and $3,093,000, respectively. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs totaling approximately $1,100,000 in connection with the retirement
of these Senior Notes and recognized a gain on these transactions of $27,188,000.

In December 2002, the Company, in connection with, and as a condition to closing the i-STT Acquisition and acquisition of Pihana Pacific, Inc. (“Pihana”) on December 31, 2002 (the “Pihana
Acquisition”) (collectively with the i-STT Acquisition, the “Combination”) and Financing (see Note 8), initiated an exchange offer to substantially reduce the amount of Senior Notes then outstanding in order to improve the
Company’s existing capital structure and reduce the amount of outstanding debt of the Company (the “Senior Note Exchange”). The Senior Note Exchange was contingent on both the Combination and Financing closing, all of which were
subject to stockholder vote. The Combination, Financing and Senior Note Exchange closed on December 31, 2002, and the Company retired an additional $116,774,000 of Senior Notes plus forgiveness of $8,855,000 of accrued and unpaid interest
thereon in exchange for 1,857,436 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $12,482,000 based on the actual exchange date of the Senior Notes and $15,181,000 of cash. The Company wrote-off a proportionate amount of unamortized debt
issuance costs and debt discount associated with these Senior Notes totaling $2,492,000 and $6,004,000, respectively. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs totaling approximately $2,500,000 in connection with the retirement of these Senior
Notes and recognized a gain on these transactions of $86,970,000. In conjunction with the Combination, Financing and Senior Note Exchange, the Company amended the Indenture in order to allow the Combination and Financing to occur.

In March 2004, with the proceeds from the Convertible Subordinated Debentures
(see Note 9), the Company redeemed all amounts outstanding under the Senior Notes, including $30,475,000 of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and terminated the Senior Notes. The redemption price of the Senior Notes was equal to 106.5%

of their principal, which resulted in an additional cash premium paid of $1,981,000 (the “Senior Note Cash Premium”). As a result, the Company
recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $3,759,000, comprised of the Senior Note Cash Premium, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount totaling $1,653,000 and other transaction fees of $125,000.
Refer to Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion (see Note 10).

7.    Credit Facility

On
December 20, 2000, the Company and a newly created, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $150,000,000 Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Facility consisted of the
following:

•

Term loan facility in the amount of $50,000,000. The outstanding term loan amount was required to be paid in quarterly installments beginning in March 2003 and ending in December
2005. The Company drew this down in January 2001.

•

Delayed draw term loan facility in the amount of $75,000,000. The Company was required to borrow the entire facility on or before December 20, 2001. The outstanding delayed
draw term loan amount was required to be paid in quarterly installments beginning in March 2003 and ending in December 2005. The Company drew this down in March 2001.

•

Revolving credit facility in an amount up to $25,000,000. The outstanding revolving credit facility was required to be paid in full on or before December 15, 2005. The Company
drew this down in June 2001.

The Credit Facility
had a number of covenants, which included achieving certain minimum revenue targets and limiting cumulative EBITDA losses and maximum capital spending limits among others. As of September 30, 2001, the Company was not in compliance with one of
these covenants. However, the syndicate of lenders provided a forbearance and, in October 2001, the Company successfully completed the renegotiation of the Credit Facility and amended certain of the financial covenants to reflect the prevailing
economic environment as part of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the “Amended and Restated Credit Facility”). As required under this amendment, the Company repaid $50,000,000 of the $150,000,000 Credit Facility outstanding as of
September 30, 2001, of which $25,000,000 represented a permanent reduction. As such, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility provided a total of $125,000,000 of debt financing and consisted of the following:

•

Term loan facility, redesignated as tranche A, in the amount of $100,000,000, which represented the remaining $100,000,000 outstanding after repayment of the $50,000,000 in October
2001.

•

Term loan facility, redesignated as tranche B, in the amount of $25,000,000, of which $5,000,000 was immediately drawn with the remaining $20,000,000 available for future draw. The
remaining $20,000,000 was only available for drawdown commencing September 30, 2002 and only if the Company remained in full compliance with all covenants as outlined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, and met an additional EBITDA
test. The ability to draw on the remaining $20,000,000 expired on December 31, 2002.

As of June 30, 2002, the Company was not in compliance with certain provisions, including the revenue covenant, of the Amended and Restated Credit
Facility. As a result, in August 2002, the Company further amended the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the “First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility”). The most significant terms and conditions of the First
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility were as follows:

•

The Company was granted a full waiver for the covenants that were not in compliance as of June 30, 2002. In addition, the amendment reset the minimum revenue and cash balance
and maximum EBITDA loss covenants through September 30, 2002.

F-32


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

The Company agreed to repay $5,000,000 of the then outstanding balance of $105,000,000 as of June 30, 2002, which was designated as a tranche B term loan. This amount was
repaid in August 2002. In addition, the remaining $20,000,000 available for borrowing under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, also designated as a tranche B term loan, was permanently eliminated. As a result, the First Amendment to the
Amended and Restated Credit Facility reduced the credit facility to a $100,000,000 credit facility, which was designated a tranche A term loan, and which remained fully outstanding as of September 30, 2002.

•

The Company must convert at least $100,000,000 of Senior Notes into common stock or convertible debt on or before November 8, 2002. As of September 30, 2002, a total of
$147,249,000 of Senior Note principal remained outstanding.

In November 2002, the lenders agreed to waive certain conditions of the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the “November 2002 Waiver”). The most significant terms and conditions of
the November 2002 Waiver were as follows:

•

The Company was granted a waiver to reset the minimum revenue and maximum EBITDA loss covenants through December 31, 2002 and the minimum cash balance covenant through
March 31, 2003.

•

The Company was granted a waiver, subject to certain conditions, of an event of default created by a minimum cash covenant default and a payment default, if any, in existence
pursuant to a previously outstanding debt facility since paid off in full.

•

The Company was granted a waiver of the covenant requiring the Company to convert $100,000,000 of Senior Notes by November 8, 2002.

•

The Company was granted a waiver, subject to certain conditions, of a default or an event of default created by a failure by the Company to make the interest payment due on the
Senior Notes in December 2002.

The November 2002
Waiver expired upon the earlier of the closing of the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the termination of the Combination, or December 31, 2002, provided that if the sole reason the Combination has not closed by
that date is as a result of pending regulatory and related approvals, the date may be extended for up to three successive 30-day periods, but such date shall not be extended past March 31, 2003.

On December 31, 2002, the Company closed the Combination, Financing (see
Note 8) and Senior Note Exchange (see Note 6), and in conjunction, the Company further amended the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the “Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility”). The most
significant terms and conditions of the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility were as follows:

•

the Company was granted a full waiver of previous covenant breaches and was granted consent to use cash in connection with the Senior Note Exchange (see Note 6);

•

future revenue and EBITDA covenants were eliminated and the remaining minimum cash balance and maximum capital expenditure covenants and other ratios were reset consistent with the
expected future performance of the combined company for the remaining term of the loan;

•

the Company permanently repaid $8,490,000 of the then currently outstanding $100,000,000 balance, bringing the total amount owed under this facility to $91,510,000 as of
December 31, 2002; and

F-33


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

the amortization schedule for the remaining amount owed under this facility was amended such that the minimum amortization due in 2003-2004 was significantly reduced.

In November 2003, in connection with the
Follow-on Equity Offering (see Note 12), the Company received consent from its senior lenders to amend the terms of Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the “Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit
Facility”). The most significant terms and conditions of the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility are as follows:

•

the Company permanently repaid $55,248,000 of the then currently outstanding principal balance of $90,519,000;

•

the banks agreed to amend the cash sweep provision, which was to commence on March 31, 2004 and would have required the Company to pay down its principal balance in an amount
equal to 50% of any cash on the Company’s balance sheet in excess of $20,000,000. This provision was amended such that it will not commence until March 31, 2005 and will only be triggered on cash amounts in excess of $25,000,000; and

•

the banks agreed to extend the term of the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility from December 2005 to December 2006. In addition, the banks amended the
amortization schedule.

Loans under the Third
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility beared interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR. Interest rates on the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility were
increased by 0.50% and the frequency of interest payments had been amended to monthly from quarterly, and such modifications remained in effect under the terms of the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility.

Borrowings under the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit
Facility were collateralized by a first priority lien against substantially all of the Company’s assets.

The costs related to the issuance of the Credit Facility were capitalized and were being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
method, over the life of the Credit Facility. As a result of amending and restating the Credit Facility multiple times from 2001 to 2003, the Company incurred additional lender fees, which had been added to debt issuance costs and were being
amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the remaining life of the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. The Company applied EITF 96-19, “Debtor’s Accounting for a Substantive
Modification and Exchange of Debt Instruments”, and concluded that the amendments to the Credit Facility were not substantive.

In February 2004, with the proceeds from the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility,
including $34,281,000 of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and terminated the Credit Facility. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $4,405,000, comprised of the write-off of unamortized
debt issuance costs totaling $4,282,000 and other transaction fees of $123,000. Refer to Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion (see Note 10).

8.    Convertible Secured Notes

The Financing

In conjunction with the Combination, STT Communications made a $30,000,000 strategic investment in the Company (the “Financing”) in the form of
a convertible secured note (the “Convertible Secured Note”),

F-34


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

convertible into shares of preferred stock, with a detachable warrant for the further issuance of 965,674 shares of preferred stock (the “Convertible
Secured Note Warrant”). The Convertible Secured Note bore non-cash interest at a rate of 14% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, and had an initial term through November 2007. Interest on the
Convertible Secured Note was payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes having a principal amount equal to the amount of interest then due having terms which were identical to the terms of the Convertible Secured Note (the
“PIK Notes”) (collectively, the “STT Convertible Secured Notes”).

The Convertible Secured Note Warrant was valued at $4,646,000, which was recorded as a discount to the debt principal. The fair value of the Convertible Secured Note Warrant was calculated under the provisions of APB
14 and determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model under the following assumptions: contractual life of five years, risk-free interest rate of 4%, expected volatility of 135% and no expected dividend yield. The Company had considered the
guidance in EITF Abstract No. 98-5, “Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios”, and had determined that the Convertible Secured Note did not contain a
beneficial conversion feature as the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of issuance, was less than the stock conversion ratio outlined in the agreement. The allocated value to the Convertible Secured Note Warrant of $4,646,000
was amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the five-year term of the Convertible Secured Note. The Convertible Secured Note Warrant was exercised in November 2005, resulting in 965,674 shares of the
Company’s preferred stock being issued and total cash proceeds to the Company of $10,000. On the same date in November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the preferred stock issued in connection with the Convertible Secured Note
Warrant into 965,674 shares of the Company’s common stock. The preferred stock converted into common stock on a 1 to 1 basis.

The Convertible Secured Note was secured by (i) a first priority security interest in i-STT’s assets and Pihana’s Singapore assets and by a
pledge of the stock of i-STT’s subsidiaries and (ii) by a second priority security interest in all of the collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility, as amended. The Convertible Secured Note was guaranteed
by all of the Company’s existing subsidiaries and by all of the Company’s future domestic subsidiaries. In November 2004, the Company and STT Communications entered into an Omnibus Amendment Agreement in which STT Communications’
security interests in the Company in connection with the Financing were lifted, except for one of the Company’s cash accounts, secured in the amount of any outstanding STT Convertible Secured Notes plus six months of forward-looking interest.
In November 2005, this final security interest in the Company was lifted in conjunction with the Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion (see below).

The Convertible Secured Note, the Convertible Secured Note Warrant and any outstanding PIK Notes could be converted into shares of the Company’s
Series A or Series A-1 preferred stock at a price of $9.1779 per underlying share at any time at the option of STT Communications (the “Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price would have been adjusted to mitigate or prevent dilution, if
dividends were declared, or the Company issued, or contracted to issue, shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share below the Conversion Price. After December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2005, the Company was
eligible to convert 95% of the STT Convertible Secured Notes and after December 31, 2005, the Company was eligible to convert 100% of the STT Convertible Secured Notes, if:

•

the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeded $32.1235 for thirty consecutive trading days;

•

the average daily trading volume of the Company’s common stock during that thirty day trading window exceeded 17,188; and

•

the Company had caused a registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act which provided for the resale by the noteholders of the shares of the Company’s
common stock issued or issuable upon conversion.

The Company was required to offer to purchase the Convertible Secured Note and any outstanding PIK Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest if the Company experienced a change of control, as defined. In addition, in connection
with the Financing, the Company issued a warrant to STT Communications, which would have become exercisable if the Company did experience a change of control (the “Change in Control Warrant”). The Change of Control Warrant, which had an
exercise price of $0.01 per share and a contractual life of five years, was contingently exercisable for shares of the Company’s common stock with a total current market value of up to 20% of:

the $30,000,000 principal amount of the Convertible Secured Note, plus

•

the principal amount of any issued and outstanding PIK Notes, minus

•

the principal amount of any portion of the Convertible Secured Note which had been converted into shares of the Company’s capital stock or repaid in cash, plus

•

accrued and unpaid interest on any then outstanding portion of the Convertible Secured Note.

The Change in Control Warrant expired unexercised in November 2005 upon the Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes
Conversion (see below).

Furthermore, the Company, in order to
provide a mechanism to allow STT Communications to ensure the Company’s compliance with covenants under the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended (see Note 7), issued two additional warrants to STT
Communications in conjunction with the Financing, which were no longer outstanding as a result of the Company paying off the Credit Facility in full in February 2004 (see Note 7). These two additional warrants, comprised of the Series A Cash Trigger
Warrant and the Series B Cash Trigger Warrant (collectively, the “Cash Trigger Warrants”), were contingently exercisable if the Company (i) did not have sufficient funds to pay, and failed to pay when due, any principal, interest, fee
or other amount due under the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended, or (ii) breached the Company’s obligations to maintain certain minimum cash balances under the terms of the Second Amendment to the
Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended. The Cash Trigger Warrants, which were to have a contractual life for as long as the Company had any remaining amounts due under the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as
amended, would have had an exercise price and be exercisable for shares of the Company’s common stock valued at up to $30,000,000 as follows:

•

The Series A Cash Trigger Warrant would have had a value of $10,000,000, with an exercise price per share which was the lesser of (i) $9.792 or (ii) 90% of the then
current market value of shares of the Company’s common stock. The $9.792 exercise price of the Series A Cash Trigger Warrant would have been adjusted to mitigate or prevent dilution if fundamental changes occured to the Company’s common
stock, dividends were declared, or the Company issued, or contracted to issue, shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share below $9.792.

•

The Series B Cash Trigger Warrant would have had a value of $20,000,000, with an exercise price per share equal to 90% of the then current market value of shares of the
Company’s common stock.

The holder of the
Cash Trigger Warrants, STT Communications, had no obligation to exercise such warrants. If the Cash Trigger Warrants were exercised based on the inability to pay any principal, interest or fees

F-36

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

due under the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended, the Cash Trigger Warrants would have been exercisable for not less
than $5,000,000 and not more than $5,000,000 plus the amount of the missed payment. If the Cash Trigger Warrants were exercised on the inability of the Company to maintain certain minimum cash balances under the terms of the Second Amendment to the
Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended, the Cash Trigger Warrants would have been exercisable for not less than $5,000,000 and not more than $5,000,000 plus any shortfall in the Company’s minimum cash balance requirement.

The Company applied EITF 00-27, “Application of Issue No. 98-5
to Certain Convertible Instruments”, and EITF 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services”, and concluded that neither a commitment
date, or a measurement date, had occurred when the Financing was closed as of December 31, 2002 in relation to the Change in Control Warrant and the Cash Trigger Warrants. As a result, the Change in Control Warrant and the Cash Trigger Warrants
were treated as unissued for accounting purposes.

During 2003
and 2004, the Company issued four PIK Notes to STT Communications totaling $8,466,000. The terms of the PIK Notes were identical to the terms of the Convertible Secured Note issued on December 31, 2002. The PIK Notes were due December 2007. The
Company had considered the guidance of EITF Abstract No. 00-27, “Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments,” and had determined that the PIK Notes did not contain a beneficial conversion feature as the fair
value of the Company’s common stock on the date of issuance was less than the stock conversion ratio outlined in the Financing agreement. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had a total of $38,466,000 of principal outstanding for the STT
Convertible Secured Notes, which were presented net of remaining discount as $35,824,000 on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 and were convertible into 4,191,193 shares of the Company’s preferred and common stock as of
December 31, 2004. The costs related to the Financing were capitalized and were being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, over the life of the Convertible Secured Note. Debt issuance costs, net of amortization,
were $336,000 as of December 31, 2004.

During the quarter
ended March 31, 2005, the Company converted an aggregate of $38,035,000 of the STT Convertible Secured Notes and associated interest into 4,144,216 shares of the Company’s Series A-1 preferred stock (the “95% STT Convertible Secured
Notes Conversion”). The converted amount represented 95% of the outstanding STT Convertible Secured Notes plus interest due through February 14, 2005. A total of $1,923,000 of STT Convertible Secured Notes remained outstanding
(the “Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes”) and continued to be governed by the terms of the Financing. On February 1, 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the Series A-1 preferred stock issued in connection with the 95%
STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion into 4,144,216 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Series A-1 preferred stock converted into common stock on a 1 to 1 basis. As a result of the 95% STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion, 95% of
the outstanding Convertible Secured Notes and PIK Notes, plus interest through February 14, 2005 and unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, was converted into stockholders’ equity in accordance with APB Opinion No. 26,
“Early Extinguishment of Debt.” As a result of the 95% STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion, a total of $35,206,000 was credited to stockholders’ equity during the first quarter of 2005, which was comprised of $36,543,000 of
Convertible Secured Note and PIK Notes principal and $1,492,000 of interest through the conversion date, offset by $2,510,000 and $319,000 of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, respectively.

In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the Remaining STT
Convertible Secured Notes and associated interest into 240,578 shares of the Company’s Series A-1 preferred stock (the “Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion”). The converted amount represented the Remaining STT
Convertible

F-37


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Secured Notes Conversion plus interest due through November 7, 2005. On November 7, 2005, STT Communications elected to convert its Series A-1
preferred stock issued in connection with the Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion into 240,578 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Series A-1 preferred stock converted into common stock on a 1 to 1 basis. As a result of the
Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion, the outstanding Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes, plus interest through November 7, 2005 and unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, was converted into stockholders’ equity
in accordance with APB Opinion No. 26, “Early Extinguishment of Debt.” As a result of the Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes Conversion, a total of $2,105,000 was credited to stockholders’ equity during the fourth quarter of
2005, which was comprised of $2,202,000 of Remaining STT Convertible Secured Notes principal, including PIK Notes issued on May 1, 2005 and November 1, 2005, and $6,000 of interest through the conversion date, offset by $91,000 and $12,000
of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, respectively.

The
Crosslink Financing

In April 2003, the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries, along with STT Communications and its affiliate, entered into a Securities Purchase and Admission Agreement with various entities affiliated with Crosslink Capital (“Crosslink”) for a $10,000,000 investment in
the Company by Crosslink in the form of convertible secured notes (the “Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes”), convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, with detachable warrants for the further issuance of 500,000 shares
of common stock (the “Crosslink Convertible Secured Note Warrants”) (collectively, the “Crosslink Financing”). This transaction closed in June 2003 and the Crosslink Convertible Secured Note Warrants were also fully exercised in
June 2003. The Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes bore non-cash interest at a rate of 10% per annum, commencing on the second anniversary of the closing of the Crosslink Financing, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and
November 1, and had an initial term through November 2007. Interest on the Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes were payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes having a principal amount equal to the amount of interest
then due having terms which are similar to the terms of the Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes (the “Crosslink PIK Notes”).

The Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes were convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $4.00 per underlying share at any
time at the option of the holders. The Crosslink PIK Notes were to be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $4.84 per underlying share at any time at the option of the holders. Such conversion prices were to have
been adjusted to mitigate or prevent dilution, if dividends were declared on the Company’s common stock or the Company issued, or contracted to issue, shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share below $4.84 per share.

The Crosslink Convertible Secured Note Warrants were valued at
$2,796,000, which was recorded as a discount to the debt principal. The fair value of the Crosslink Convertible Secured Note Warrants was calculated under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 14 and determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model under the following assumptions: contractual life of five years, risk-free interest rate of 4%, expected volatility of 135% and no expected dividend yield. The Company had considered the guidance of EITF Abstract No. 00-27,
“Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments,” and had determined that the Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes did contain a beneficial conversion feature. The beneficial conversion feature was valued at
$7,204,000 (the “Crosslink Beneficial Conversion Feature”), and was also reflected as a discount to the debt principal. The combined values of both the Crosslink Convertible Secured Note Warrants and the Crosslink Beneficial Conversion
Feature, totaling $10,000,000, was being amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes.

The Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes shared with the Company’s Convertible Secured Note issued on December 31,
2002, in connection with the Financing, a second priority security interest in all of the collateral

F-38


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

securing the Company’s obligations under the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. Such second priority security interest was
lifted in connection with the Crosslink Conversion (see below).

The Convertible Secured Note and PIK Notes issued in connection with the Financing, the Crosslink Convertible Secured Notes and the Crosslink PIK Notes were collectively referred to herein as the “Convertible Secured Notes.”

In March 2004, holders of the Company’s Convertible
Secured Notes issued in connection with the Crosslink Financing, converted the $10,000,000 of principal into 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company refers to this transaction as the “Crosslink Conversion.” As a
result of the Crosslink Conversion and the fact that the Crosslink Financing had the Crosslink Beneficial Conversion Feature, the Company recognized a loss on debt conversion on this transaction of $7,610,000, representing the write-off of
unamortized debt discount, in accordance with EITF Issue 00-27 “Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments.” Refer to Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion (see Note 10).

9.    Convertible Subordinated Debentures

In February 2004, the Company issued $86,250,000 principal amount of 2.5%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2024 (the “Convertible Subordinated Debentures”). Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 15 and August 15 of each year.

The Convertible Subordinated Debentures are governed by the Indenture dated
February 11, 2004, between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”). The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the
incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Convertible Subordinated Debentures are unsecured and rank junior in right of payment to the Company’s existing or future senior
debt.

The Convertible Subordinated Debentures are convertible
into shares of the Company’s common stock. Each $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Subordinated Debentures are convertible into 25.3165 shares of the Company’s common stock. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately
$39.50 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2005, the Convertible Subordinated Debentures were convertible into 2,183,548 shares of the Company’s common stock. Holders of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures may convert their
individual debentures into shares of the Company’s common stock only under any of the following circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter after the quarter ending June 30, 2004 (and only during such calendar quarter) if the sale price of the Company’s common stock, for at least 20
trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price per share of our common stock, or approximately $47.40 per share;

•

subject to certain exceptions, during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per Convertible Subordinated Debenture
for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such day;

•

if the Convertible Subordinated Debentures have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions described in the Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange in which the Company’s
common stock would be converted into cash or property other than securities.

F-39


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The conversion rates may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events including for any cash
dividend, but they will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a debenture. Instead, interest
will be deemed cancelled, extinguished and forfeited upon conversion. Convertible Subordinated Debentures called for redemption may be surrendered for conversion prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption
date.

The Company may redeem all or a portion of the
Convertible Subordinated Debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date
of redemption.

Holders of the Convertible Subordinated
Debentures have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, each of which is referred to as a purchase date. In
addition, upon a fundamental change of the Company, as defined in the Indenture, each holder of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures may require us to repurchase some or all of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures at a purchase price equal to
100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Company has considered the guidance in EITF Abstract No. 98-5, “Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios”, and has determined that the
Convertible Subordinated Debentures do not contain a beneficial conversion feature as the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of issuance, was less than the initial conversion price outlined in the agreement. The Convertible
Subordinated Debentures contained two embedded derivatives, a bond parity clause and a contingent interest provision, which no longer exists as a result of the filing of a registration statement, which was declared effective by the SEC in
July 2004. The remaining embedded derivative, the bond parity clause, had a zero fair value as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company will be remeasuring the remaining embedded derivative each reporting period, as applicable. Changes
in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations.

The costs related to the Convertible Subordinated Debentures were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, through February 15, 2009, the first date that the holders of the
Convertible Subordinated Debentures can force redemption to the Company. Debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, net of amortization, were $2,011,000 and $2,651,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

10.    Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion

As a result of the extinguishment of debt associated with
the Credit Facility, Heller Loan Amendment, VLL Loan Amendment and the Senior Notes, as well as the Crosslink Conversion, the Company recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment and conversion totaling $16,211,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2004, as summarized below (in thousands):

11.    Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line and Amendment

In December 2004, the Company entered into a $25,000,000 line of credit
arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank that originally would have matured in December 2006 (the “Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line”). This facility was a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit which, at the Company’s election, up to
$10,000,000 could have been converted into a 24-month term loan, repayable in eight quarterly installments. Borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line bore interest at floating interest rates plus applicable margins over the LIBOR rate or
the greater of the bank’s prime rate or 4.0%. If the Company elected to convert any revolving borrowings into a 24-month term loan, the applicable margin upon conversion to a term loan would have increased by 0.25% per annum.

The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line also featured sublimits, which enabled
the Company to issue letters of credit (the “Letters of Credit Sublimit”), enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. The Company’s utilization under any of these sublimits would have
the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had utilized $3,172,000 under the
Letters of Credit Sublimit with the issuance of three letters of credit and, as a result, reduced the amount of borrowings available to the Company from $25,000,000 to $21,828,000. As of December 31, 2004, there has been no other utilization
among the other sublimits.

The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line
was collateralized by the Company’s domestic assets except that such security interest did not include real and intellectual property. The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line had several covenants, including financial covenants that were subject to
a quarterly test and which required the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance, a 6-month cumulative revenue target and a minimum operating cash flow target. The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line was furthermore subject to a tiered financial
covenant test, Covenant Levels 1 and 2, which were also reflected in the applicable borrowing margins that were available to the Company. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was still subject to Covenant Level 1. In January 2005, the Company
converted 95% of the outstanding STT Convertible Secured Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, into 4,144,216 shares of the Company’s preferred stock (see Note 8). As a result of this conversion, the Company became subject to Covenant Level 2
and the applicable borrowing margin was reduced by 0.25% per annum. In addition, two of the financial covenants were adjusted during Covenant Level 2 such that the minimum cash balance was increased and the minimum operating cash flow target
was removed.

The costs incurred related to the Silicon Valley
Bank Credit Line were capitalized and were being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line. These debt issuance costs, net of amortization, were $177,000 as of
December 31, 2004.

In September 2005, the Company amended
the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line by entering into a $50,000,000 revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $25,000,000 line of credit arrangement with the same bank (the “Silicon Valley
Bank Credit Line Amendment”). The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment has a three-year commitment, which enables the Company to borrow, repay and re-borrow the full amount, up to September 15, 2008. Borrowings under the Silicon
Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In October 2005, the Company elected to borrow $30,000,000 from the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line
Amendment at a one-month LIBOR interest rate, inclusive of the applicable margin, of 5.72% per annum (the “$30,000,000 Drawdown”), which was used to fund a portion of the Ashburn Campus Property Acquisition (see Note 2). Upon the
one-month maturity date of the $30,000,000 Drawdown, the Company had the opportunity to either repay all or a portion of the $30,000,000 Drawdown, or convert the $30,000,000 Drawdown into a new borrowing at either the then applicable one, three or
six month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin or at the prime rate. The Company elected to continue rolling this drawdown forward

F-41


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

in monthly increments at the then applicable one-month LIBOR interest rates, inclusive of the applicable margin, until such time as the Company decided to
repay the $30,000,000 Drawdown in full in January 2006 at which point the effective interest rate had risen to 6.12% (see Note 18). As of December 31, 2005, the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment had an interest rate of 6.12% per
annum. The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment also features sublimits, which allow the Company to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. The Company’s
utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had utilized $6,680,000 under the letters of credit sublimit with the issuance of five letters of credit and, as a result, further reduced the amount of borrowings available to the Company from $50,000,000 to
$13,320,000. The Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s domestic assets and contains several financial covenants which require compliance with maximum leverage ratios, working capital
ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, which the Company is in full compliance of as of December 31, 2005. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is limited under the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment, such that,
without the prior written consent of Silicon Valley Bank, the aggregate amount of any cash dividends may not exceed 25% of the Company’s assets.

At the time the Company entered into the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment, a total of $112,000 of issuance costs remained unamortized related to
the original Silicon Valley Bank Credit. In addition, the Company incurred $342,000 of additional issuance costs to secure the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment. In accordance with EITF Issue 98-14, “Debtor’s Accounting for Changes
in Line-of-Credit or Revolving-Debt Arrangements”, the Company has capitalized the total of such issuance costs, which are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Silicon Valley Bank Credit
Line Amendment. These debt issuance costs, net of amortization, were $409,000 as of December 31, 2005.

12.    Stockholders’ Equity

In December 2002, the Company amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to change the authorized share capital to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which
25,000,000 has been designated Series A, 25,000,000 has been designated as Series A-1 and 50,000,000 is undesignated.

Preferred Stock

On December 31, 2002, as a result of the i-STT Acquisition, the Company issued 1,868,667 shares of Series A preferred stock to STT Communications. As
of December 31, 2004, this preferred stock had a total liquidation value of $18,298,000. In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert these shares into 1,868,667 shares of the Company’s common stock.

The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A and Series A-1
preferred stock were as follows:

Voting
Rights

.    Holders of Series A preferred stock were entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which such preferred stock could then be converted. Except as otherwise provided by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, Series A-1 preferred stock shall have no voting rights. Until the earlier of either December 31, 2004 or the date on which less than 100 shares of the Company’s Series A preferred stock remained outstanding, the holders of shares of
Series A preferred stock were entitled to elect a number of directors at any election of directors, as follows:

•

three directors for so long as the holders of Series A preferred stock collectively beneficially owned at least 30% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock;

F-42


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

two directors for so long as the holders of Series A preferred stock collectively beneficially owned at least 15% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock;

•

one director for so long as the holders of Series A preferred stock collectively beneficially owned at least 100 shares of the Company’s outstanding voting stock; and

•

no directors at such time as the holders of Series A preferred stock collectively beneficially owned less than 100 of the Company’s outstanding voting stock.

Effective December 31, 2004, these voting
rights expired.

Dividend
Rights.

Holders of Series A preferred stock and Series A-1 preferred stock were entitled to receive an amount equal to any dividend paid on the Company’s common stock as may be declared from time to time by the
Company’s board of directors.

Liquidation
Rights

.    In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Company’s assets available for distribution to stockholders were to be distributed to holders of common stock, Series A preferred
stock and Series A-1 preferred stock on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of common stock held by each assuming full conversion of Series A preferred stock and Series A-1 preferred stock, until holders of Series A preferred stock
and Series A-1 preferred stock had received $9.792 per share of Series A preferred stock and Series A-1 preferred stock, plus the amount of any declared but unpaid dividends for each share of Series A preferred stock and Series A-1
preferred stock. Thereafter, any remaining available assets for distribution to stockholders were to be distributed among the holders of the Company’s common stock pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock held by each.

Redemption Rights

.    Beginning after
December 31, 2009, the Company was allowed any time it may lawfully do so, at the option of the Company’s board of directors, redeem some or all of the Series A preferred stock or Series A-1 preferred stock, on a pro rata basis, at a price
in cash per share equal to the number of shares of the Company’s common stock into which such share may then be converted multiplied by the average closing sale price of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq National Market (or any
trading system on which the Company’s common stock may then trade) over the 30 consecutive trading day period ending five trading days prior to the date of redemption. There were no sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company’s
Series A preferred stock or Series A-1 preferred stock.

Conversion and Other Rights

.    The Company’s Series A preferred stock was convertible at any time into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company’s Series A-1 preferred stock was
convertible into Series A preferred stock or shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis as long as the conversion of the Series A-1 preferred stock would not cause STT Communications to hold more than 40% of outstanding voting stock; however,
this restriction was lifted subsequent to December 31, 2004. Notwithstanding this limitation, and except for limitations imposed by the HSR Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), the Company’s Series A-1
preferred stock was convertible into Series A preferred stock or common stock in the following circumstances:

•

STT Communications made a fully financed tender offer for all of the Company’s outstanding stock and at least 50% of the outstanding shares not held by STT Communications were
tendered;

•

the Company commenced bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings;

•

a third party obtained a 15% interest in the Company;

•

the Company agreed to sell a 15% or greater interest in the Company to a third party;

F-43


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

the Company sold all or substantially all of its assets, or entered into an agreement to sell all or substantially all of its assets;

•

a third party commenced a bona fide, fully financed tender offer;

•

STT Communications’ nominees were not elected to our board of directors despite STT Communications voting in favor of such nominees;

•

the Company breached certain material agreements with STT Communications contained in the Financing or Combination agreements;

•

STT Communications’ interest in the Company fell below 10%; or

•

the Cash Trigger Warrants were exercised (see Note 8).

In addition, the Company was able to force all but 100 shares of the Company’s Series A preferred stock and all shares of Series A-1 preferred stock
(subject to the conversion restrictions described above) to convert into shares of the Company’s common stock after the Company reported four consecutive quarters of net income. However, as mentioned above, all of the Company’s preferred
stock was converted to common stock at the election of STT Communications in November 2005.

The Company’s Series A and Series A-1 preferred stock had no preemptive or other subscription rights.

Common Stock

On November 21, 2003, the Company sold 5,524,780 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $20.00 per share, which resulted in net proceeds to
the Company of $104,443,000. The Company refers to this transaction as the follow-on equity offering (the “Follow-on Equity Offering).

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has reserved the following shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock for future issuance:

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

In May 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “2000 Purchase Plan”) under which 31,250 shares were reserved for issuance, and after January 1, 2005, no additional shares were added to the 2000 Purchase Plan. The last purchase under the 2000 Purchase Plan was in
July 2005, at which time the 2000 Purchase Plan ceased and the unused reserved shares expired.

In June 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2004 Purchase Plans”, collectively with the
2000 Purchase Plan, the “Purchase Plans”) as successor plans to the 2000 Purchase Plan. A total of 500,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the 2004 Purchase Plans, and the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004
Purchase Plans automatically increases on January 1 each year beginning in 2005 by the lesser of

2% of the shares of common stock then outstanding or 500,000 shares. The 2004 Purchase Plans permit eligible employees to purchase common stock on favorable
terms via payroll deductions, up to 15% of the employee’s cash compensation, subject to certain share and statutory dollar limits. Two overlapping offering periods commence during each calendar year, on each February 14 and August 14
or such other periods or dates as determined by the Compensation Committee from time to time, and the offering periods last up to 24 months with a purchase date every six months. The price of each share purchased is 85% of the lower of a) the fair
market value per share of common stock on the last trading day before the commencement of the applicable offering period or b) the fair market value per share of common stock on the purchase date. The 2004 Purchase Plans are administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and such plans will terminate automatically in June 2014 unless a) the 2004 Purchase Plans are extended by the Board of Directors and b) the extension is approved within 12 months by the
Company’s stockholders.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, 218,158 shares were issued under the Purchase Plans at a weighted average purchase price of $15.62 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 314,637 shares were issued under the 2000 Purchase Plan at a weighted
average purchase price of $4.24 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2003, 191,307 shares were issued under the 2000 Purchase Plan at a weighted average purchase price of $2.98 per share.

Stock Option Plans

In May 2000, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan as the successor plan
to the 1998 Stock Plan. In August 2000 the Company ceased to issue additional grants under the 1998 Stock Plan, and unexercised options under the predecessor 1998 Stock Plan that cancel due to an optionee’s termination may be reissued under the
successor 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. Under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, nonstatutory stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees, outside directors and consultants at not
less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of grant, and incentive stock options may be granted, for a limited time, to employees at not less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted prior to October 1,
2005 generally expire 10 years from the grant date, and options granted to employees and consultants on or after October 1, 2005 will generally expire seven years from the grant date, subject to continuous service of the optionee. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company has reserved a total of 6,572,927 shares for issuance under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan of which 659,964 were still available for grant, and the plan reserve may be increased on January 1 each year by the
lesser of 6% of the common stock then outstanding or 6,000,000 shares. The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Board may terminate or amend the plan, with approval of the
stockholders as may be required by applicable regulations, at any time.

In May 2000, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2000 Director Option Plan, which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2003. Under the 2000 Director Option Plan, each non-employee board member who was
not previously an employee of the Company will receive an automatic initial nonstatutory stock option to purchase 7,000 shares (in addition to an option for 8,000 shares, or 13,000 if chairperson of the Audit Committee, granted from the 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan), which vests in four annual installments. In addition, each non-employee board member will receive an annual nonstatutory stock option to purchase 2,500 shares (in addition to an option to purchase 2,500 shares granted from the 2000
Equity Incentive Plan) on the date of the Company’s regular Annual Meeting of Stockholders, provided the board member will continue to serve as a director thereafter. Such annual option shall vest in full on the earlier of a) the first
anniversary of the grant, or b) the date of the regular Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the year following the grant date. A new director who receives an initial option will not receive an annual option in the same calendar year. Options
granted under the 2000 Director Option Plan will have an option price not less than 100%

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of the fair market value on the date of grant and will have a 10-year contractual term, subject to continuous service of the board member. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company has reserved 343,440 shares subject to options for issuance under the 2000 Director Option Plan of which 298,438 were still available for grant, and an additional 50,000 shares may be added to the reserve on
January 1 each year. The 2000 Director Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Board may terminate or amend the plan, with approval of the stockholders as may be required by applicable
regulations, at any time.

In September 2001, the Company
adopted the 2001 Supplemental Stock Plan, under which nonstatutory stock options and restricted shares may be granted to consultants and employees who are not executive officers or board members, at not less than 85% of the fair market value on the
date of grant. Options granted prior to October 1, 2005 generally expire 10 years from the grant date, and options granted on or after October 1, 2005 will generally expire seven years from the grant date, subject to continuous service of
the optionee. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has reserved a total of 1,493,961 shares for issuance under the 2001 Supplemental Stock Plan, of which 461,766 were still available for grant. The 2001 Supplemental Stock Plan is administered
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and the plan will continue in effect indefinitely unless the Board decides to terminate it earlier.

The 1998 Stock Plan, 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, 2000 Director Option Plan and 2001 Supplemental Stock Plan are collectively referred to as the
“Stock Option Plans.”

A summary of the Stock Option
Plans is as follows:

The weighted-average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 7.80 years, 8.37 years and 8.91 years,
respectively. The weighted-average exercise price of options outstanding at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $31.55, $25.42 and $17.56, respectively. The weighted-average exercise price of options exercisable at December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $32.98, $37.21 and $37.19, respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Employees

The Company used the intrinsic-value method prescribed in APB No. 25 in
accounting for its stock-based compensation arrangements with employees through December 31, 2005. As a result, stock-based compensation expense was recognized for employee stock option grants in those instances in which (i) the fair value
of the underlying common stock was greater than the exercise price of the stock option at the date of grant and (ii) employee stock option grants were modified subsequent to issuance, primarily in connection with termination of employment, as
was the case with the Transition and Separation Agreement in November 2005, which resulted in $1,389,000 of stock-based compensation expense being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 (see “Employment Agreements” in Note 14). In
addition, in February 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 320,500 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers pursuant to the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The restricted shares are
subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates to certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As
a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock until the restricted shares become vested. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Stock-Based
Compensation” and “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.

In total, the Company recorded deferred stock-based compensation, net of forfeitures, related to employees of $12,545,000 and $695,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A total of

F-47


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

$8,112,000, $1,459,000 and $2,818,000 has been amortized to stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual equity awards, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4,692,000 of deferred stock-based compensation
remaining to be amortized related to employee equity awards.

Non-Employees

The Company uses the fair value
method to value options granted to non-employees. In connection with its grant of options to non-employees, the Company recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $402,000 and zero for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. A total of $165,000, $8,000 and $87,000 has been amortized to stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $238,000 of
deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to non-employee equity awards.

There were four non-employee stock options grants during 2005. There were no non-employee stock options grants during 2004. There was one non-employee
stock option grant during 2003. The Company’s calculations for non-employee grants were made using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31:

Warrants

In January 2000, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement for
its new corporate headquarters facility in Mountain View, California. In connection with the lease agreement, the Company granted the lessor a warrant to purchase up to 1,034 shares of the Company’s common stock at $192.00 per share (the
“Headquarter Warrant”). The warrant expires 10 years from the date of grant. The warrant was valued at $186,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was recorded as additional rent expense during the Company’s lease term
at that location (the Company terminated this lease and moved its headquarters to Foster City in March 2003). The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the warrant: deemed fair value per share of $209.60, dividend yield of
0%, expected volatility of 80%, risk-free interest rate of 6.0% and a contractual life of 10 years.

In addition, the Company has issued several warrants in connection with its capital lease and other financing obligations (see Note 5) and Senior Notes
(see Note 6). No warrants were issued during 2005; however, the Convertible Secured Note Warrant (see Note 8) and the Hong Kong Lease Amendment Warrants (see Note 14) were exercised during 2005. In addition, VLL Loan Amendment Warrants covering
3,628 shares and Senior Note Warrants covering 8,230 shares were exercised during 2005.

Taxes

Income or loss before income taxes is attributable
to the following geographic locations for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

The provision for
income tax of $543,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to the federal and state alternative minimum tax. The provision for income tax of $153,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily recorded
for the Company’s foreign operations. No provision for federal income taxes was recorded from inception through December 31, 2003 as the Company incurred net operating losses (“NOL”) during this period.

State tax expense not based on income is included in general and
administrative expenses and the aggregated amount was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to pre-tax income

F-49


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The types of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities are set out below as of December 31 (in thousands):

The Company’s
accounting for deferred taxes under SFAS No. 109 involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction. To support the Company’s conclusion that a
100% valuation allowance was required, the Company primarily considered such factors as the Company’s history of operating losses, the nature of the Company’s deferred tax assets and the absence of taxable income in prior carryback years.
Although the Company’s operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods within the next several years, the Company’s evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets
indicates that such plans are not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence. Approximately $735,000 of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option deductions, the benefit from
which will be allocated to additional paid-in capital rather than current income when subsequently recognized. In addition, approximately $6,400,000 of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to the i-STT Acquisition in Singapore,
the benefit from which will be allocated to goodwill associated with the i-STT Acquisition rather than current tax expense when subsequently recognized.

The valuation allowance increased by $25,661,000, $54,503,000 and $34,099,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The change of valuation
allowance in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to the increase in the temporary differences related to fixed assets and accruals. The changes of valuation allowance in fiscal 2004 and 2003 were primarily due to the increase in net
operation loss generated in the years.

Federal and State tax
laws, including California tax laws, impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. In 2003, the Company conducted an analysis to determine whether an ownership change had occurred due to the significant stock transactions in each of the reporting years disclosed. The analysis indicated that an ownership change
occurred during the fiscal year 2002, which resulted in an annual limitation of approximately $819,000, for the net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to 2003 and therefore, the Company has substantially reduced its federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards for the period prior to 2003 to approximately $16,400,000. Additionally, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the Company’s ability to utilize the tax deductions associated with its depreciable
assets as of the end of the 2002 tax year to offset the taxable income in future years, due to the existence of a Net Unrealized Built-In Loss (“NUBIL”) at the time of the change in control. Such a limitation will be effective for a
five-year period

F-50


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

subsequent to the change in control through 2007. The Company has also updated the analysis for the fiscal year 2005 and concluded there was no ownership
change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the year.

The Company expects to pay a limited amount of tax for fiscal year 2006. The tax costs will be primarily limited to alternative minimum taxes as the Company anticipates utilizing its net operating loss carryforwards from post-2002 tax years
and expects to have significant tax deductions attributable to stock options exercised in the year.

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $65,000,000 and $50,000,000 available to reduce future taxable income for federal and
state income tax purposes, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in the year 2019. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not
utilized, in the year 2006. In addition, the Company’s foreign operations had approximately $88,400,000 of net operating loss and unclaimed capital allowance carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income for local income tax purposes.
Approximately $21,400,000 of the foreign operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in the year 2006, while the rest of the foreign operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.

14.    Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Lease Terminations and Amendments

In October 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an
asset sale agreement with an affiliated company of STT Communications (the “Buyer”), which is also a current customer of Equinix, in which (a) the Company exited from its IBX center lease in Singapore (the “Pihana Singapore IBX
Hub”) that the Company acquired in the Pihana Acqusition effective September 30, 2003, (b) the Buyer has entered into a new lease agreement directly with the landlord for the Pihana Singapore IBX Hub, (c) the Company sold the
related assets located in and transferred certain agreements related to the operations of the Pihana Singapore IBX Center to the Buyer for one Singapore dollar (pursuant to the Pihana Acqusition, these assets had no value ascribed to them as the
Pihana Singapore IBX Center was operating at a loss and generating negative cash flow), (d) the Company contemporaneously entered into a separate colocation agreement for a smaller portion of space in the Pihana Singapore IBX Center for 60
months in which the Company will be the customer of the Buyer at current fair value rates at the time (approximately $4,000 per month for approximately 1,980 square feet) and (e) the Buyer has agreed to procure additional IBX center services in
the Company’s other Singapore IBX center that it acquired in the i-STT Acquisition at current fair value rates at the time (approximately $600 per month) (the “Singapore Asset Sale Agreement”). As a result of the Singapore Asset Sale
Agreement, the Company surrendered several deposits related to the Pihana Singapore IBX Hub; however, this loss was offset by the write-off of the associated deferred rent and asset retirement obligation liabilities associated with the Pihana
Singapore IBX Center resulting in a nominal loss on asset sale of $18,000. As a result of this transaction, the Company has only one primary IBX center in Singapore (the one acquired in the i-STT Acquisition) rather than two. The Company accounted
for the Singapore Asset Sale Agreement consistent with the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 57, “Related Party Disclosures”, EITF 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”, and APB No. 29,
“Accounting for Non-Monetary Transactions.”

In May
2004, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company amended its lease for its Hong Kong IBX center (the “Amendment to the Hong Kong IBX Lease”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment to the Hong Kong IBX Lease, the Company amended the term of
the lease and the monthly rent payments due under the lease. In addition, the Company issued a guarantee to the landlord that the Company’s wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary will comply with all terms of the amended lease for the remainder of
the lease term. The remaining monthly lease payments covered under this guarantee through October 2013 total $6,488,000 as of December 31, 2005. In exchange for entering into the Amendment to the Hong Kong IBX Lease, the Company issued warrants
to the

F-51

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

landlord to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share, which were immediately exercisable (the
“Hong Kong Lease Amendment Warrants”) and which were exercised for cash during 2005. The Hong Kong Warrants were valued at $2,477,000 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which are being amortized to rent expense over the
remaining term of the lease. The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the Hong Kong Warrants: fair market value per share of $28.13, dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility of 100%, risk-free interest rate of 2.80% and
a contractual life of seven years. The value of these warrants is included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $259,000 and
$194,000, respectively, of non-cash rent expense associated with the Hong Kong Lease Amendment Warrants.

In June 2004, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company amended its lease for its Tokyo IBX center (the “Amendment to the Tokyo IBX Lease”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment to the Tokyo IBX Lease, which is governed by Japanese law, the Company amended the monthly rent payments due under the lease for the remainder of the lease term commencing April 2004, resulting in a monthly
reduction of 3,500,000 Japanese yen (approximately $30,000 as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2005).

In October 2005, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement for the early termination of its approximate 40 acre ground lease of real
property in San Jose, California (the “San Jose Ground Lease”) whereby the Company will pay $40,000,000 over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher
cumulative lease payments through 2020 (the “San Jose Ground Lease Termination”). As a result of the San Jose Ground Lease Termination, the Company recorded a significant restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 (see Note 17).
Pursuant to the terms of the San Jose Ground Lease Termination, the revised lease termination date is December 31, 2007; however, the landlord has the right to terminate the San Jose Ground Lease prior to December 31, 2007 upon providing
the Company at least ten days prior written notice. Regardless of the actual termination date for the San Jose Ground Lease, the Company is obligated to pay $40,000,000 over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, in equal quarterly
installments. The Company does not currently use the San Jose Ground Lease property for any purpose.

Operating Lease Commitments

The Company currently leases the majority of its IBX centers and certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements. The majority of the Company’s operating leases for its IBX centers expire at various dates expiring from
2010 through 2020 with renewal options available to the Company. The centers’ lease agreements typically provide for base rental rates that increase at defined intervals during the term of the lease. In addition, the Company has negotiated rent
expense abatement periods to better match the phased build-out of its centers. The Company accounts for such abatements and increasing base rentals using the straight-line method over the life of the lease. The difference between the straight-line
expense and the cash payment is recorded as deferred rent.

Minimum future operating lease payments as of December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

F-52


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Total rent expense was approximately $29,425,000, $30,837,000 and $28,646,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Deferred rent, primarily included in deferred rent and other liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets, was $18,792,000 and $22,915,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In October 2005 and December 2004, the Company recorded
restructuring charges related to three excess operating leaseholds that the Company intends to exit from (see Note 17). As a result, as of December 31, 2005, the Company had a restructuring accrual related to these excess operating leases
totaling $49,831,000 on the accompanying balance sheet. As a result of already presenting the liability associated with these operating leases on the Company’s balance sheet, the future lease costs associated with these three leases for excess
space are not presented in the operating lease totals presented above.

Other Purchase Commitments

Primarily as a
result of the Company’s recent Sunnyvale IBX Acquisition, Chicago IBX Acquisition and Los Angeles IBX Acquisition (see Note 2), as of December 31, 2005, the Company was contractually committed for $20,274,000 of unaccrued capital
expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to bring these acquired IBX centers to Equinix standards prior to making them available to customers for installation,
including the Required Capital Expenditure Spending for the New Los Angeles IBX. Furthermore and pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Payable (see Note 5), the Company has agreed to invest at least $40,000,000 in capital improvements to the Ashburn
Campus by December 31, 2007, which the Company expects to spend fully during 2006 as a result of the Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion Project (see Note 18). Lastly, the Company has numerous other, smaller future purchase commitments in
place as of December 31, 2005, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S. and Singapore, through 2006 and 2007 and other open purchase orders which contractually bind the Company for good or services to be
delivered or provided in 2006. Such other miscellaneous purchase commitments total $7,057,000 as of December 31, 2005.

Letter of Credit Commitments

In connection with five of our IBX operating leases, the Company has entered into five irrevocable letters of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. These
letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the Letters of Credit Sublimit provision in connection with the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line Amendment (see Note 11). The letters of credit total $6,680,000, are collateralized by the
Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration dates. If the landlords for any of these IBX operating leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit, the Company will be
required to fund these letters of credit.

Legal Actions

On July 30, 2001 and August 8, 2001, putative shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed against the Company, certain of its officers and directors (the “Individual Defendants”), and several investment banks that were underwriters of the Company’s IPO. The cases were filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased the Company’s stock between August 10, 2000 and December 6, 2000. In addition, similar lawsuits were filed against approximately
300 other issuers and related parties. The purported class action alleges violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) and Sections 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“1934 Act”) against the Company and Individual Defendants. The plaintiffs have since dismissed the

F-53


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Individual Defendants without prejudice. The suits allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in the Company’s IPO to certain
investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for the Company’s IPO was
false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. The action seeks damages in an unspecified amount. On February 19, 2003, the Court dismissed the Section 10(b) claim against the
Company, but denied the motion to dismiss the Section 11 claim.

In July 2003, a Special Litigation Committee of the Equinix Board of Directors approved a settlement agreement and related agreements which set forth the terms of a settlement between the Company, the Individual Defendants, the plaintiff
class and the vast majority of the other approximately 300 issuer defendants and the individual defendants currently or formerly associated with those companies. Among other provisions, the settlement provides for a release of the Company and the
Individual Defendants and the Company’s agreeing to assign away, not assert, or release certain potential claims the Company may have against its underwriters. The settlement agreement also provides a guaranteed recovery of $1 billion to
plaintiffs for the cases relating to all of the approximately 300 issuers. To the extent that the underwriter defendants settle all of the cases for at least $1 billion, no payment will be required under the issuers’ settlement agreement. To
the extent that the underwriter defendants settle for less than $1 billion, the issuers are required to make up the difference. It is anticipated that any potential financial obligation of Equinix to plaintiffs pursuant to the settlement, of which
such claims are currently expected to be less than $3.4 million, will be covered by existing insurance and we do not expect that the settlement will involve any payment by the Company. The Company has no information as to whether there are any
material limitations on the expected recovery by other issuer defendants of any potential financial obligation to plaintiffs from their own insurance carriers. On February 15, 2005, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement
agreement, subject to certain modifications consistent with its opinion. Those modifications have been made. There is no assurance that the court will grant final approval to the settlement. As approval by the Court cannot be assured, the Company is
unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of the litigation would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

On October 13, 2004, the Court certified a Section 11 class in four of the six cases that were the subject of
class certification motions and determined that the class period for Section 11 claims is the period between the IPO and the date that unregistered shares entered the market. The Court noted that its decision on those cases is intended to
provide strong guidance to all parties regarding class certification in the remaining cases. Plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify a class in the Equinix case. Until the settlement is finalized and approved by the Court, or in the event such
settlement is not approved, the Company and its officers and directors intend to continue to defend the actions vigorously. While an unfavorable outcome to this case is reasonably possible, and the Company can estimate its potential exposure to be
less than approximately $3.4 million, it is not probable. As a result, the Company has not accrued for any settlements in connection with this litigation as of December 31, 2005.

Estimated and Contingent Liabilities

The Company estimates exposure on certain liabilities, such as income and property taxes, based on the best information available at the time of
determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, the Company records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each
specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond the Company’s control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on the property may change, such as a landlord selling the
underlying property of one of the Company’s IBX center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, the Company’s property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most
current facts and

F-54

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

circumstances, the Company makes the necessary property tax accruals for each of its reporting periods. However, revisions in the Company’s estimates of
the potential or actual liability could materially impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

In July 2005, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Assessment of Income Tax from the state of Hawaii asserting a tax deficiency, plus interest,
totaling $613,000 (the “Tax Assessment”). The deficiency is stemmed from certain refundable tax credits that the state of Hawaii subsequently disallowed in the examination of the Hawaii income tax returns for the tax years of 2000 and 2001
filed by Pihana, which the Company acquired on December 31, 2002. The Company strongly believes the disallowance of the refundable tax credits by the state of Hawaii is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that it has meritorious
defenses to the claim. The Company intends to oppose the Tax Assessment vigorously and will file a timely request with the Board of Review in the state of Hawaii to appeal the Tax Assessment. The Company does not believe it is probable it will be
required to pay the Tax Assessment upon the completion of the appeals process. As a result, the Company has not accrued for any loss contingencies in connection with this Tax Assessment as of December 31, 2005.

From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that
arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there are
no pending claims of which the outcome is expected to result in a material adverse effect in the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Employment Agreements

In January 2001, the Company had agreed to indemnify an officer of the Company for any claims brought by his former employer under an employment and
non-compete agreement the officer had with this employer. As of December 31, 2005, no claims had been made by the former employer.

Through September 2003, the Company had entered into severance agreements with certain of its executive officers. Under the terms of the agreements, the
officers are entitled to one year’s salary, bonus and certain healthcare benefits in the event of an involuntary termination for reasons other than cause. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company had accrued $318,000 in connection with one of
the these severance agreements for an executive officer whose employment with the Company ended in early 2006 as agreed upon during the fourth quarter of 2005.

In November 2005, the Company entered into a transition and separation agreement with one of the Company’s executive officers in which the
agreed-upon separation date with the Company would be in March 2006 (the “Transition and Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Transition and Separation Agreement, the Company accrued $668,000 of severance-related costs
during 2005. In addition, the Company modified all outstanding stock option grants for this executive officer and, as a result, the Company recorded $1,389,000 of stock-based compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with
these modifications.

Employee Benefit Plan

The Company has a 401(k) Plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a
portion of their compensation, limited to $14,000 in 2005. Employee contributions and earnings thereon vest immediately. Although the Company may make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan, no contributions have ever been

F-55

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

made as of December 31, 2005. However, commencing in 2006, the Company has elected to begin making contributions on behalf of its employees, which will
be limited to 50 percent of the employees’ first 6% of salary deferred into their 401(k) account and will be subject to vesting based on the individual employee’s start date.

Guarantor Arrangements

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby the Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences
while the officer or director is, or was serving, at the Company’s request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the
Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits the Company’s exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any
future amounts paid. As a result of the Company’s insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company has no significant liabilities recorded for these agreements
as of December 31, 2005.

The Company enters into standard
indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally
the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with any U.S. patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company’s services. The term of these
indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the
Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. The Company has no significant liabilities
recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2005.

The Company enters into arrangements with its business partners, whereby the business partner agrees to provide services as a subcontractor for the Company’s implementations. The Company may, at its discretion and in the ordinary
course of business, subcontract the performance of any of its services. Accordingly, the Company enters into standard indemnification agreements with its customers, whereby the Company indemnifies them for other acts, such as personal property
damage, of its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has general and umbrella insurance policies that enable
the Company to recover a portion of any amounts paid. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these
agreements is minimal. The Company has no significant liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2005.

The Company has service level commitment obligations to certain of its customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in
the Company’s IBX centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service level commitments to these customers. The Company’s liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services,
equipment damage or inability to meet the Company’s service level commitment obligations, particularly in the early stage of the Company’s development, could reduce the confidence of the Company’s customers and could consequently
impair the Company’s ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both the Company’s ability to generate revenues and the Company’s operating results. Historically, these service level credits have not been
significant; however, during the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a total of $457,000 in service level credits to various customers primarily in connection with two separate power outages that affected the Company’s
Chicago

and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. The Company generally has the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue
being recognized. The Company has no significant liabilities in connection with service level credits as of December 31, 2005.

Under the terms of the Combination Agreement, the Company is contractually obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that at all times
from and after the closing of the Combination, until such time as neither STT Communications nor its affiliates hold the Company’s capital stock or debt securities (or the capital stock received upon conversion of the debt securities) received
by STT Communications in connection with the Combination, that none of the Company’s capital stock issued to STT Communications is constituted as “United States real property interests” within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under Section 897(c) of the Code, the Company’s capital stock issued to STT Communications would generally constitute “United States real property interests” at such point in time that the fair
market value of the “United States real property interests” owned by the Company equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the aggregate fair market values of (a) the Company’s “United States real property interests,”
(b) the Company’s interests in real property located outside the U.S., and (c) any other assets held by the Company which are used or held for use in the Company’s trade or business. The Company refers to this provision in the
Combination Agreement as the FIRPTA covenant. Pursuant to the FIRPTA covenant, the Company may be forced to take commercially reasonable proactive steps to ensure the Company’s compliance with the FIRPTA covenant, including, but not limited to,
(a) a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to all real property interests, or (b) the formation of a holding company organized under the laws of the Republic of Singapore which would issue shares of its capital stock in exchange for all
of the Company’s outstanding stock (this reorganization would require the submission of that transaction to the Company’s stockholders for their approval and the consummation of that exchange). The Company has entered into an agreement
with STT Communications and its affiliate pursuant to which, the Company will no longer be bound by the FIRPTA covenant as of September 30, 2009. Currently, the Company is in compliance with the FIRPTA covenant. The Company has no liabilities
recorded related to non-compliance with the FIRPTA covenant as of December 31, 2005.

When as part of an acquisition the Company acquires all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of a company, the Company assumes the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the
date of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. The Company has no significant liabilities recorded for any such liabilities as of
December 31, 2005; however, refer to “Estimated and Contingent Liabilities” above.

The majority of our operating leases are signed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. In certain of these cases, particularly for the leases of our
IBX properties, the landlord has asked the Company to issue a guarantee to the landlord that these wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company will comply with all terms of the lease for the remainder of the lease term. The vast majority of such leases
are accounted for as an operating lease and, as a result, future operating lease payments are not recorded on our balance sheet. For a summary of these future operating lease commitments, refer to “Operating Lease Commitments” above. The
Company believes that it has sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash flows generated from operations, to meet the Company’s currently identified business objectives and that the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries will be able to
comply with all terms of these leases for the remainder of their lease terms. The Company has no significant liabilities recorded for these guarantor agreements as of December 31, 2005.

15.    Related Party Transactions

2003, the Company entered into an asset sale agreement with an affiliate of STT Communications (see Note 14). In November 2004, the Company and STT Communications entered into an Omnibus Amendment Agreement in which STT Communications’ security
interests in the Company in connection with the Financing were lifted, except for one of the Company’s cash accounts, secured in the amount of any outstanding STT Convertible Secured Notes plus six months of forward-looking interest. (see Note
8). During 2005, all of the outstanding STT Convertible Secured Notes and accrued and unpaid interest through November 7, 2005, was converted into 4,384,794 shares of the Company’s stock (see Note 8).

17.    Restructuring Charges

Restructuring Charges

In December 2004, in light of the
availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs the Company would incur in building out new space, the Company made the decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of the
Company’s New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above its original Los Angeles IBX. As a result of the Company’s decision to exit these spaces, the Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $17,685,000, which
represents the present value of the Company’s estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment
attributed to the partial build-out of the excess space on the floor above its Los Angeles IBX as outlined below. Both lease terms run through 2015.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”, at the beginning of its fiscal year
2003. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, the Company estimated the future cash payments required to exit these two leased spaces, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then
calculated the present value of such future cash flows in order to determine the appropriate restructuring charge to record. In future periods, the Company will record accretion expense to accrete its accrued restructuring liability up to an amount
equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of these leases. Should the actual lease exit costs differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company may need to adjust its restructuring charges associated with
the excess lease spaces, which would impact net income in the period such determination was made.

A summary of the 2004
restructuring charges through December 31, 2004 is outlined as follows (in thousands):

Prior to the
Company’s decision to exit the excess space on the floor above its original Los Angeles IBX in December 2004, the Company had recorded deferred rent in connection with this leasehold as it straightlined the associated rent expense from lease
inception in April 2001 to December 2004 totaling $881,000. In conjunction with the Company’s decision to exit from this excess lease, the Company reclassified this deferred rent liability from deferred rent to accrued restructuring charges as
of December 31, 2004 and adjusted the restructuring charge accordingly.

In January 2005, the Company sublet the excess space in the New York metro area for a two-year period and is currently evaluating opportunities related to its excess space in Los Angeles, as well as the excess space
in the New York metro area beyond the two-year sublease. As the Company currently has no plans to enter into lump sum lease terminations with either of the landlords associated with these two excess space leases, the Company has reflected its
accrued restructuring liability as both current and non-current on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. The Company is contractually committed to these two excess space leases through 2015.

2005 Restructuring Charges

In October 2005, in light of the availability of fully or
partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion among some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, the Company made the decision that retaining the approximately 40 acre San
Jose Ground Lease for future expansion was no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, the Company entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for the early termination of the San Jose Ground Lease property whereby the
Company will pay $40,000,000 over the next four years plus property taxes, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020 (see Note 14) (the
“San Jose Ground Lease Termination”). As a result of the San Jose Ground Lease Termination, the Company recorded a $33,814,000 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which represents the present value of the Company’s
estimated future cash payments to exit this property, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the development of this property.

The Company estimated the future cash payments required to exit the San Jose Ground Lease, net of any estimated subrental
income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then calculated the present value of such future cash flows in order to determine the appropriate restructuring charge to record. The Company’s use of this property terminates
on December 31, 2007 and can be terminated at any time prior to December 31, 2007 upon the landlord providing the Company at least ten days prior written notice; however, even if the landlord early terminates, the Company is still required
to pay the full $40,000,000 of payments due. In future periods, the Company will record accretion expense to accrete its accrued restructuring liability up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit
of the San Jose Ground Lease.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In January 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved stock options to be
granted to employees, excluding executive officers, to purchase an aggregate of 648,500 shares of common stock as part of the Company’s annual refresh program. The actual grant date and the exercise price of such stock options are expected to
be determined sometime in March 2006. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved the issuance of 250,000 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers pursuant to the 2000 Equity Incentive
Plan. The restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates at pre-determined levels. All such equity awards will be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment,” and related pronouncements, which are expected to have a significant impact to the Company. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Stock-Based Compensation” and “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements” in Note 1.

In February 2006, the Company
announced its intention to build out a new IBX center within the Ashburn Campus (see Note 2) in order to further expand its existing Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center. The Company intends to build out one of the undeveloped buildings located on
the Ashburn Campus for a cost of approximately $50,000,000 to $55,000,000, of which approximately $40,000,000 is expected to be incurred in 2006. The center will feature an updated design that will enable the Company to support the increased power
and cooling demands of customers. The Company intends to open the new center for customers in early 2007 (the “Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion Project”). The Washington, D.C. Metro Area IBX Expansion Project will fulfill the
Company’s requirement to invest at least $40,000,000 in capital improvements to the Ashburn Campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Payable (see Note 5).

In February 2006, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale
agreement to purchase a vacant 228,000 square foot standalone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9,750,000, payable upon closing. The agreement is subject to numerous closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion by
the Company of a comprehensive due diligence review of the property. As part of the evaluation process, the Company is considering several partnering and financing options for building out this center and is also evaluating options to build out this
center in a phased approach. A new center would be interconnected to the Company’s downtown Chicago IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by the Company (the “Chicago Metro Area IBX Expansion Project”). If the Company
pursues the Chicago Metro Area IBX Expansion Project, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. The Company’s revenues and results of operations have been subject
to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and the Company’s revenues and results of operations could fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Significant quarterly fluctuations in revenues will cause
significant fluctuations in our cash flows and the cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable accounts on the Company’s balance sheet. Causes of such fluctuations may include the volume and timing of new orders and renewals, the sales
cycle for our services, the introduction of new services, changes in service prices and pricing models, trends in the Internet infrastructure industry, general economic conditions, extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the
occurrence of unexpected events.

The unaudited quarterly
financial information presented below has been prepared by the Company and reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the financial position and
results of operations for the interim periods presented.
