Overview

Equinix, Inc. connects more than

9,800

companies directly to their customers and partners across the world's most interconnected data center and interconnection platform. Platform Equinix

®

combines a global footprint of state-of-the-art International Business Exchange™ (IBX

®

) data centers, a variety of interconnection solutions, unique business and digital ecosystems and expert support. Today, businesses leverage the Equinix interconnection platform in


strategic markets across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). Equinix operates as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT").

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of

December 31, 2018

, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, Japan, and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, United Arab Emirates and a portion of Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs").

Careful, steady expansion has been key to Equinix's growth strategy since our founding, as we seek to offer our customers interconnection opportunities ahead of demand. In April 2018, Equinix purchased the 1.6 million-square foot Infomart Building™ in Dallas, including its operations and tenants, where we had already been operating four Equinix data centers. In the same month, we closed our acquisition of Australian data center provider Metronode and its 10 data centers.

In September 2018, Equinix named Charles Meyers President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Meyers also joined Equinix's Board of Directors. Meyers succeeded Peter Van Camp, who had served as interim CEO since January 2018. Upon Meyers' appointment as CEO, Van Camp resumed his role as Executive Chairman of the Equinix Board of Directors, a position he has held since 2005. Meyers joined Equinix in 2010 as President, Equinix Americas, leading our most profitable region through a time of significant growth and strong operating performance. Meyers then served as the Chief Operating Officer at Equinix, where he led the Global Sales, Marketing, Operations and Customer Success teams. For the past year, he was President, Strategy, Services and Innovation (SSI) leading Equinix's strategic business teams including Corporate Strategy, Technology Innovation, Product Management and Engineering. Under Meyers' leadership, SSI worked to optimize our position as a cloud enabler, identify key growth areas, and evolve our offerings in response to market, competitive and technology trends.

Industry Background

The internet is a collection of numerous independent networks interconnected to form a network of networks. Users on different networks communicate with each other through interconnection between these networks. For example, when a person sends an email to someone who uses a different provider for his or her connectivity (e.g. Comcast versus AT&T), the email must pass from one network to the other to get to its final destination. A data center provides a physical point at which that interconnection can occur.



To accommodate the rapid growth of internet traffic that was occurring in the early years of the internet, an organized approach for network interconnection was needed. This was the start of the network era, when networks gained mutual advantage by exchanging data traffic on interoperable platforms. The exchange of traffic between these networks became known as peering, which is when networks agree to trade traffic at relatively equal amounts, often at no charge to the other party. At first, government and nonprofit organizations established places where these networks could peer with each other. These points were known as network access points, or NAPs. Over time, many NAPs became a natural extension of carrier services and were run by companies such as MFS (now a part of Verizon Business), Sprint, Ameritech and Pacific Bell (the latter two now part of AT&T).

Ultimately, these NAPs were unable to scale with the growth of the internet, and the lack of "neutrality" by the carrier owners of these NAPs created a conflict of interest with the participants. This created a market need for network-neutral interconnection points that could accommodate the rapidly growing demand to increase performance for enterprise and consumer users of the internet, especially with the rise of important content providers such as AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo! and others. In addition, the providers, as well as a growing number of enterprises, required a more secure and reliable solution for direct connection to a variety of telecommunications networks, as the importance of their internet operations continued to grow. These were the seeds of the connected era, when peering expanded exponentially among new players, and access to information anytime and anywhere became the norm.

To accommodate internet traffic growth, the largest networks left the NAPs and began connecting and trading traffic by placing private circuits between each other. Peering, which once occurred at the NAP locations, was moved to these private circuits. Over the years, these circuits became expensive to expand and could not be built quickly enough to accommodate traffic growth. This led to a need by the large carriers to find a more efficient way to peer. The multi-tenant or colocation data center was introduced to meet this need. Today, many customers satisfy their requirements for peering through data center providers like Equinix because this strategy permits them to peer with the networks within one location, using simple, direct and secure connections. Their ability to peer within a data center or across a data center campus, instead of across a metro area, has increased the scalability of their operations while decreasing network costs.

The interconnection model has further evolved over the years to include new offerings, as the collaborative landscape of the interconnected era imposes new demands for connectivity that facilitates more scalable interactive and real-time digital interconnections. Enterprises are becoming increasingly interdependent and cloud- and digital-enabled, and to compete they need real-time data exchange and reliable, instant connections between and across any given digital ecosystem. Starting with the peering and network communities, interconnection has been used for new network solutions, including carrier Ethernet, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and mobile services, in addition to traditional international private line and voice services. The data center industry is working to keep up with the rapid digital transformation of today's businesses, and it continues to evolve with a set of new network offerings (such as SDN, blockchain and 5G) where interconnection is often used to solve any challenge using both physical and virtual networks, across geographic boundaries.

In addition, the enterprise customer segment is also evolving. In the past, most enterprises opted to keep their data center requirements in-house. However, current trends are leading more enterprise chief information officers (CIOs) to either outsource their data center requirements, and/or extend their corporate wide area networks (WANs) into carrier-neutral colocation facilities where there are dense ecosystems of network, cloud and IT service providers, and business partners that enterprises can directly and securely interact with in real-time.

The following are macro, technology and regulatory trends that are forcing enterprises and service providers across all industries to rethink their IT architectures to decrease complexity and cost, and seize new opportunities to compete successfully as digital businesses:

•

Digital business

transformation is becoming a global phenomenon.

According to IDC, by 2021 at least 50% of global GDP will be digitized, and growth in every industry will be driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships. Interconnection becomes a key building block for digital business along that journey because real-time interactions between people, things, locations, clouds and data are critical in a digital age.

•

Urbanization is increasing in the majority of metros worldwide.

Today, about 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, and that will grow to 68% by 2050, according to the United Nations. With so many people so close together, digital services must be increasingly concentrated and close to users, so companies can deliver the connectivity their users expect. Interconnection brings applications, data, content and networking into proximity in these densely populated areas. It allows companies to deliver on their service promises, even as demand keeps growing.



•

Cybersecurity has increased in frequency, scope and complexity in our more closely connected world.

In fact, a large-scale cybersecurity breach is one of the most serious risks facing companies today. Ernst & Young projects the global cost of cybersecurity breaches will reach $6.0 trillion by 2021. Companies need to strengthen their defenses, even as they increase their vulnerability by distributing their data across a variety of sources and users. To do that, businesses need their security controls to be distributed as well, leveraging interconnection out at the edge where most traffic exchange is happening. The direct, private nature of interconnection also increases data protection and lowers the risk of being compromised.

•

Data Compliance has become a mandate among businesses around the world.

The digital economy may be global, but more countries are regulating the data at the heart of the digital economy and prescribing enhanced rules around personal data protections (e.g., GDPR). But remaining compliant is about more than following the rules. In a Thompson Reuters survey, 69% of respondents said successful compliance efforts can drive up business efficiency and effectiveness by enabling greater focus on value-added activities. The need to address compliance drives interconnection because it enables companies to link their data storage, analytics and clouds in the same business region. That data can stay proximate, and local if required by regulations, but still be accessed globally to meet business requirements.

•

Business Ecosystems

are becoming the life-blood of digital business.

Gartner predicts that by 2021, the number of organizations using a mix of intermediaries will more than double, and that active engagement by these organizations with industries in ecosystems outside their native industry will nearly triple. The reason is that digital trade flows are creating global business and data processes that involve an increasing variety of customers, partners and employees. Interconnection securely and efficiently connects all the players in all these business ecosystems, as those ecosystems expand in depth and number

.

Other trends that we see impacting our customers' IT strategies include:

•

The need for businesses and organizations to create a "digital edge" - where commerce, population centers and digital ecosystems meet. A more geographically distributed IT infrastructure is needed to support the digital operations that now cover every global region and every aspect of today's global businesses.

•

The growth of "proximity communities" that rely on immediate physical colocation and interconnection with strategic partners and customers. Examples include financial exchange ecosystems for electronic trading and settlement, media and content provider ecosystems, and ecosystems for real-time bidding and fulfillment of internet advertising.

•

The Internet of Things (IoT), big data infrastructures, artificial intelligence (AI) and the emergence of 5G high-speed mobile and wireless networks, which are creating unprecedented quantities of data that fuel digital business.

•

The accelerating adoption and ubiquitous nature of cloud computing technology services, in particular hybrid/multiclouds, along with enterprise cloud service offerings such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and security and disaster recovery services.

•

The continuing growth of consumer internet traffic from new bandwidth-intensive services (e.g., video, voice over IP, social media, mobile data, gaming, data-rich media), Ethernet and wireless services, as well as new devices (e.g., wearables, home assistances, AR/VR headsets). These devices and services also increase the requirements for anytime, anywhere and any device interconnection out at the edge to improve the performance, security, scalability and reliability of interconnecting people, locations, clouds, data and things.

•

Significant increases in power and cooling requirements for today's data center equipment. New generations of servers and storage devices continue to concentrate processing capability and the associated power consumption and cooling load into smaller footprints; and many legacy-built data centers are unable to accommodate these new power and cooling demands. The high capital costs associated with building and maintaining "in-sourced" data centers creates an opportunity for capital savings by leveraging an outsourced colocation model.

Industry analysts project the compound annual growth rate of the global carrier neutral colocation market to be approximately 8.4% between 2018 and 2022.

®

(IOA

®

) strategy. Based on work with many Fortune 500 customers, our IOA framework is an engagement model that both enterprises and solution providers can leverage to directly and securely connect people, locations, clouds and data. An IOA strategy shifts the fundamental IT delivery architecture from siloed and centralized to interconnected and distributed. Since the introduction of its IOA strategy, Equinix has created the "IOA Playbook" and "IOA Knowledge Base™," which were developed from our aggregated learnings across more than 600 Equinix customer (enterprise and service provider) deployments. These tools are offered online at no charge to any organization and provide fundamental, repeatable steps that organizations can take to deploy an IOA strategy across common digital workloads. They offer application blueprints for networks, security, data and applications, as well as for various use cases including ecosystems, analytics, content delivery, collaboration, hybrid multicloud and the IoT.

When combined with Equinix's critical mass of network and cloud providers and content companies, the increasing rate of adoption of an IOA strategy by the world's enterprise companies enables Equinix to extend its leadership as one of the core interconnection hubs of the information-driven, digital world. The density of providers inside Equinix is a key selling point for companies looking to connect with a diverse set of networks and deliver the best connectivity to their end customers at the digital edge, as well as to network companies that want to sell bandwidth to companies and efficiently interconnect with other networks. Equinix currently houses more than

1,800

unique networks, including the top-tier networks, which allow customers to directly interconnect with providers that best meet their unique price and performance needs. We have a growing mass of key players in cloud and IT services (Amazon Web Services, AT&T, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Office 365, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud and SAP Cloud Platform, Salesforce.com, IBM Cloud and VMware Cloud), and in the enterprise and financial/insurance sectors (Anheuser-Busch, Aon, Bloomberg, Deloitte, Ericsson, Ford Motors, NASDAQ, PayPal, Sysco Foods and The Society of Lloyd's) as customers. We expect these customer segments will continue to grow as customers seek to leverage our density of network providers and interconnect directly with each other to improve performance.

Streamline ease of doing business globally.

Customers say data center reliability, power availability and network choice are the most important attributes they consider when choosing a data center provider in a particular location. We have long been recognized as a leader in these areas.

In 2018, more than half of our revenue came from customers with deployments in all three of our global regions, and we expect global solutions to become an increasingly important data center selection criteria as the need for globally interconnected, on-demand digital IT architectures continues to grow. We continue to focus on strategic acquisitions to expand our market coverage and on global product standardization, pricing and contracts harmonization initiatives to meet these global demands.



Deepen existing ecosystems and develop new ones.

As various enterprises and service and content providers locate in our IBX data centers, their suppliers and business partners benefit by doing the same, and they gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct, global interconnection for their business ecosystems. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "network effect" of customer adoption. Our interconnection offerings enable scalable, secure, reliable and cost-effective interconnectivity and optimized traffic exchange, which lowers overall costs and increases flexibility. The ability to directly and globally interconnect with a wide variety of companies is a key differentiator for us and enables companies to create new opportunities within unique ecosystems by working together. We also have efficient and innovative internet and cloud exchange platforms in our IBX sites to accelerate commercial growth within the ecosystems via the network effect.

Expand our product and service portfolio

We recently introduced our Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric™ to connect our data centers around the world and enable customers to connect on demand to clouds, networks and any other customer from any Equinix location. We also recently introduced Equinix SmartKey™, a global key management and encryption as a service offering to help our customers manage the security requirements of disbursing data across multiple clouds and third-party providers. We will continue to work with our customers to innovate and introduce new solutions to meet their evolving needs.

Expand vertical go-to-market plan.

We plan to continue to focus our go-to-market efforts on customer segments and business applications that appreciate the Equinix value proposition of interconnection, reliability, global reach and prime collaboration opportunities within and across ecosystems. We have identified these segments today as cloud and IT services, content and digital media, financial services, enterprises, and network and mobile service providers. As digital business evolves, we will continue to identify and focus our go-to-market efforts on industry segments that need our value proposition.

Accelerate global reach and scale.

We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in select markets based on customer demand. In April 2018, we purchased the 1.6 million-square foot Infomart Building™ in Dallas, including its operations and tenants, where we had already been operating four data centers. Also, in April 2018, we completed our acquisition of Australian data center provider Metronode and its 10 data centers, which expanded our operations into Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth, and added scale in Melbourne and Sydney. This acquisition tripled our Australian data center footprint to 15 sites. Careful, steady expansion has been key to our growth strategy since our founding, as we seek to offer our customers interconnection opportunities ahead of demand. As of the end of 2018, Equinix's total global footprint had expanded to


data centers in


markets in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific.

We expect to continue to execute our global expansion strategy in a cost-effective and disciplined manner through a combination of acquiring existing data centers through lease or purchase, acquiring or investing in local data center operators, and building new IBX data centers based on key criteria, such as demand and potential financial return in each market.

Our current interconnection solutions are comprised of the following:

Physical Cross Connect/Direct Interconnections.

Customers needing to directly and privately connect to another IBX data center customer can do so through single or multi-mode fiber. These cross connections are the physical link between customers and can be implemented within 24 hours of request.

Equinix Internet Exchange™.

Customers may choose to connect to and peer through the central switching fabric of our Equinix Internet Exchange, rather than purchase a direct physical cross connection. With a connection to this switch, a customer can aggregate multiple interconnects over one physical connection with multiple, linked 100-gigabit ports of capacity, instead of purchasing individual physical cross connects.

Equinix Metro Connect

.

Customers who are located in one IBX data center may need to interconnect with networks or other customers located in an adjacent or nearby IBX data center in the same metro area. Metro Connect allows customers to seamlessly interconnect between IBX data centers at capacities up to 100 Gigabits per second.

Internet Connectivity.

Customers who are installing equipment in our IBX data centers generally require IP connectivity or bandwidth access. Although many large customers prefer to contract directly with carriers, we offer customers the ability to contract for IP connectivity and bandwidth access through us from any of the major bandwidth providers in that data center. This bandwidth access is targeted to customers who require a single bill and a single point of support through Equinix for the entire contract for their bandwidth needs.

Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric™ (ECX Fabric™).

The ECX Fabric directly and securely connects distributed infrastructure and digital ecosystems on Platform Equinix via global, software-defined interconnection. It enables businesses to customize their connectivity to partners, customers and suppliers through an interface that provides all the benefits companies have come to expect from "as-a-service" models. This includes real-time provisioning via a portal or API, pay-as-you-go billing increments and the removal of friction in establishing elastic connectivity between metros. The ECX Fabric is designed for scalability, agility and virtualized connectivity. Through a single port, Equinix customers can discover and reach anyone on demand, locally or across metros.

The new ECX Fabric capabilities are now available in the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions, including Amsterdam, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Helsinki, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Manchester, Melbourne, Miami, Milan, Munich, New York, Osaka, Paris, São Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, D.C. and Zurich.

Business Continuity Trading Rooms

Trading infrastructure is mission-critical for financial firms worldwide, and our Business Continuity Trading Rooms (BCTRs) ensure that trading does not stop, even if primary operations are knocked off-line or are disabled. A BCTR backs up our customers' trading operations in one of our secure data center facilities, right down to telephone services and multiple desktop monitors. BCTR offerings are protected with backup generators and uninterruptible power supply to guarantee reliability and deliver peace of mind.

Sales and Marketing

Sales.

We use a direct sales force and channel marketing program to market our offerings to global enterprises, content providers, financial companies, and mobile and network service providers. We organize our sales force by customer type, as well as by establishing a sales presence in diverse geographic regions, which enables efficient servicing of the customer base from a network of regional offices. In addition to our worldwide headquarters located in Silicon Valley, we have established an Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Hong Kong and an EMEA regional headquarters in Amsterdam. We also operate a network of sales offices to deploy our field sales and support teams in our major markets across all three regions.

Our sales team works closely with each customer to foster the natural network effect of our IBX model, resulting in access to a wider potential customer base via our existing customers. As a result of the IBX interconnection model, IBX data center participants often encourage their customers, suppliers and business partners to also locate in our IBX data centers. These customers, suppliers and business partners, in turn, encourage their business partners to locate in our IBX data centers, resulting in additional customer growth. This network effect significantly reduces our new customer acquisition costs. In addition, large network providers, cloud providers or managed service providers may refer customers to Equinix as a part of their total customer solution. Equinix also focuses the selling by our vertical sales specialists on supporting specific industry requirements for network, mobile, and media and content providers, financial services, cloud computing, systems integrators and enterprise customer segments.

The Equinix channel program adds an ecosystem of system integrators and service providers, from managed network to cloud services. They help our customers design and deploy the right cloud and IT solutions needed to reach their customers, employees and supply chains. Our channel partners understand how to leverage and integrate the advantages of the Platform Equinix global footprint, high performance connectivity options and global supply-chain ecosystems to deliver solutions that meet our customers' performance, reliability and cost requirements.

Marketing.

To support our sales efforts and to actively promote our brand in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include active public relations and ongoing customer communications programs. Our marketing efforts are focused on major business and trade publications, online media outlets, industry events and sponsored activities. Our staff holds leadership positions in key networking organizations, and we participate in a variety of internet, enterprise IT, computer and financial industry conferences, placing our officers and employees in keynote speaking engagements at these conferences. We also regularly measure customer satisfaction levels and host key customer forums to ensure customer needs are understood and incorporated in product and service planning efforts. From a brand perspective, we build recognition through our website, external blog and social media channels by sponsoring or leading industry technical forums, by participating in internet industry standard-setting bodies and through advertising, paid social media and online campaigns. We continue to develop and host industry educational forums focused on peering technologies and practices for ISPs and content providers.



Our Competition

While a large number of enterprises own their own data centers, many others outsource some or all of their requirements to multi-tenant data center (MTDC) facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. We believe that the outsourcing trend is likely to accelerate in the coming years. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than

1,200

companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world, ranging in size from firms with a single data center in a single market to firms in over 20 markets. Equinix competes with these firms which vary in terms of their data center offerings, including:

Colocation Providers

Colocation data centers are a type of MTDC that can also be referred to as "retail" data center space. Typically, colocation data center space is offered on the basis of individual racks/cabinets or cages ranging from 500 to 10,000 square feet in size. Typical customers of colocation providers include:

•

Large enterprises with significant IT expertise and requirements

•

Small and medium businesses looking to outsource data center requirements

•

Cloud and network service providers

•

Electronic trading, digital payments and financial services companies

•

Internet application providers

•

Major internet content, entertainment and social networking providers

•

Shared, dedicated and managed hosting providers

•

Mobile and network service providers

•

Content delivery networks

Full facility maintenance and systems, including fire suppression, security, power backup and HVAC, are routinely included in managed colocation offerings. A variety of additional services are typically available, including remote hands technician services and network monitoring services.

Providers in addition to Equinix that offer colocation both globally and locally include firms such as COLT and NTT.

Carrier-Neutral Colocation Providers

In addition to data center space and power, colocation providers also offer interconnection. Some of these providers, known as network or carrier-neutral colocation providers, can offer customers the choice of hundreds of network service providers or ISPs to choose from. Typically, customers use interconnection to buy ethernet or internet connectivity, perform financial exchange and settlement functions or perform business-to-business e-commerce. Carrier-neutral data centers are often located in key network hubs around the world, such as New York, Ashburn, Va., London, Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong. Two types of data center facilities offering carrier-neutral colocation are used for many network-to-network interconnections:

•

A Meet Me Room (MMR) is typically a smaller space, generally 5,000 square feet or less, located in a major carrier hotel and often found in a wholesale data center facility.

•

A carrier-neutral data center is generally larger than an MMR and may be a stand-alone building separate from existing carrier hotels.

Providers in addition to Equinix that we believe could be defined as offering carrier-neutral colocation include CoreSite, Digital Realty Trust, Global Switch, Interxion and Telehouse.

Wholesale Data Center Providers

Wholesale data center providers lease data center space that is typically offered in cells or pods (i.e., individual white-space rooms) ranging in size from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet or larger. Wholesale data center offerings are targeted to both enterprises and colocation providers. These data centers primarily provide space and power without additional services like technicians, remote hands services or network monitoring (although other tenants might offer such services).

Sample wholesale data center providers include Digital Realty Trust and Global Switch.



Managed Hosting Providers

Managed hosting services are provided by several firms that also provide data center colocation solutions. Typically, managed hosting providers can manage server hardware that is owned by either the hosting provider or the customer. They can also provide a combination of comprehensive systems administration, database administration and sometimes application management services. Frequently, this results in managed hosting providers "running" the customer's servers, although such administration is frequently shared. The provider may manage such functions as operating systems, databases, security and patch management, while the customer will maintain management of the applications riding on top of those systems.

The full list of potential services that can be offered as part of managed hosting is substantial and includes services such as remote management, custom applications, helpdesk, messaging, databases, disaster recovery, managed storage, managed virtualization, managed security, managed networks and systems monitoring. Managed hosting services are typically used for:

•

Application hosting by organizations of any size, including large enterprises

•

Hosted or managed messaging, including Microsoft Exchange and other complex messaging applications

•

Complex or highly scalable web hosting or e-commerce websites

•

Managed storage solutions (including large drive arrays or backup robots)

•

Server disaster recovery and business continuity, including clustering and global server load balancing

•

Database servers, applications and services

Examples of managed hosting providers include: AT&T, CenturyLink, NaviSite, Rackspace, SunGard and Verizon Business.

Unlike other providers whose core businesses are bandwidth or managed services, we focus on neutral interconnection hubs for cloud and IT service providers, content providers, financial companies, enterprises and network service providers. As a result, we do not have the limited choices found commonly at other hosting/colocation companies. We compete based on the quality of our IBX data centers, our ability to provide a one-stop global solution in our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific locations, the performance and diversity of our network- and cloud-neutral strategy, and the economic benefits of the aggregation of top network, cloud and business ecosystems under one roof. We expect to continue to benefit from prevailing industry trends, including the need to create a “digital edge”, the growth of proximity communities, the increasing adoption of IOT, AI, 5G cloud computing, the continued growth of internet traffic and the increased power and cooling requirements of new generations of IT equipment.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us:

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial or strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.

We have completed numerous acquisitions and expect to make additional acquisitions in the future. These may include (i) acquisitions of businesses, products, solutions or technologies that we believe to be complementary, (ii) acquisitions of new IBX data centers or real estate for development of new IBX data centers or (iii) acquisitions through investments in local data center operators. We may pay for future acquisitions by using our existing cash resources (which may limit other potential uses of our cash), incurring additional debt (which may increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements) and/or issuing shares (which may dilute our existing stockholders and have a negative effect on our earnings per share). Acquisitions expose us to potential risks, including:

•

the possible disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention by acquisition, transition and integration activities, particularly when multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at the same time;

•

our potential inability to successfully pursue or realize some or all of the anticipated revenue opportunities associated with an acquisition or investment;

•

the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, or businesses in which we invest, or achieve anticipated operating efficiencies or cost savings;

•

the possibility that announced acquisitions may not be completed, due to failure to satisfy the conditions to closing as a result of:

◦

an injunction, law or order that makes unlawful the consummation of the acquisition;

◦

inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties of, or the non-compliance with covenants by, either party;

◦

the nonreceipt of closing documents; or

◦

for other reasons;

•

the possibility that there could be a delay in the completion of an acquisition, which could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects resulting from uncertainty about completion of the respective acquisition;

•

the dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of our issuing stock as consideration in a transaction or selling stock in order to fund the transaction;

•

the possibility of customer dissatisfaction if we are unable to achieve levels of quality and stability on par with past practices;

•

the possibility that we will be unable to retain relationships with key customers, landlords and/or suppliers of the acquired businesses, some of which may terminate their contracts with the acquired business as a result of the acquisition or which may attempt to negotiate changes in their current or future business relationships with us;

•

the possibility that we could lose key employees from the acquired businesses before integrating them;

•

the possibility that we may be unable to integrate or migrate IT systems, which could create a risk of errors or performance problems and could affect our ability to meet customer service level obligations;

•

the potential deterioration in our ability to access credit markets due to increased leverage;

•

the possibility that our customers may not accept either the existing equipment infrastructure or the "look-and-feel" of a new or different IBX data center;

•

the possibility that additional capital expenditures may be required or that transaction expenses associated with acquisitions may be higher than anticipated;

•

the possibility that required financing to fund an acquisition may not be available on acceptable terms or at all;

•

the possibility that we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under antitrust and competition laws on a timely basis or at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing an acquisition, limit our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;

•

the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses;

•

the possibility that future acquisitions may present new complexities in deal structure, related complex accounting and coordination with new partners, particularly in light of our desire to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT;



•

the possibility that we may not be able to prepare and issue our financial statements and other public filings in a timely and accurate manner, and/or maintain an effective control environment, due to the strain on the finance organization when multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at the same time;

•

the possibility that future acquisitions may trigger property tax reassessments resulting in a substantial increase to our property taxes beyond that which we anticipated;

•

the possibility that future acquisitions may be in geographies and regulatory environments to which we are unaccustomed and we may become subject to complex requirements and risks with which we have limited experience;

•

the possibility that carriers may find it cost-prohibitive or impractical to bring fiber and networks into a new IBX data center;

•

the possibility of litigation or other claims in connection with, or as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;

•

the possibility that asset divestments may be required in order to obtain regulatory clearance for a transaction;

•

the possibility of pre-existing undisclosed liabilities, including, but not limited to, lease or landlord related liability, environmental liability or asbestos liability, for which insurance coverage may be insufficient or unavailable, or other issues not discovered in the diligence process; and

•

the possibility that we receive limited or incorrect information about the acquired business in the diligence process. For example, we sometimes do not receive all of the customer contracts associated with our acquisitions in the diligence process, which affects our visibility into customer termination rights and could expose us to additional liabilities.

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. If an acquisition does not proceed or is materially delayed for any reason, the price of our common stock may be adversely impacted and we will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.

We cannot assure that the price of any future acquisitions of IBX data centers will be similar to prior IBX data center acquisitions. In fact, we expect costs required to build or render new IBX data centers operational to increase in the future. If our revenue does not keep pace with these potential acquisition and expansion costs, we may not be able to maintain our current or expected margins as we absorb these additional expenses. There is no assurance we would successfully overcome these risks, or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions.

Our substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flows and limit our flexibility to raise additional capital.

We have a significant amount of debt and may need to incur additional debt to support our growth. Additional debt may also be incurred to fund future acquisitions, any future special distributions, regular distributions or the other cash outlays associated with maintaining our qualification for taxation as a REIT. As of

December 31, 2018

, our total indebtedness (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, and debt premium) was approximately

$11.4 billion

, our stockholders' equity was

$7.2 billion

and our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled

$0.6 billion

. In addition, as of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately

$1.9 billion

of additional liquidity available to us from our

$2.0 billion

revolving credit facility. Some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility. In addition to our substantial debt, we lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancellable lease agreements, some of which are accounted for as operating leases. As of

December 31, 2018

, our total minimum operating lease commitments under those lease agreements, excluding potential lease renewals, was approximately

$2.0 billion

, which represents off-balance sheet commitments.

Our substantial amount of debt and related covenants, and our off-balance sheet commitments, could have important consequences. For example, they could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt and in respect of other off-balance sheet arrangements, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, execution of our expansion strategy and other general corporate requirements;

•

increase the likelihood of negative outlook from our credit rating agencies;

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our various debt instruments;

•

increase our cost of borrowing and even limit our ability to access additional debt to fund future growth;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors;

•

limit our operating flexibility through covenants with which we must comply, such as limiting our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock;



•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, which would also limit our ability to further expand our business; and

•

make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. These risks could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could adversely impact our business and financial condition.

Adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit markets have created, and in the future may create, uncertainty and unpredictability and add risk to our future outlook. An uncertain global economy could also result in churn in our customer base, reductions in revenues from our offerings, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition, adversely affecting our liquidity. The uncertain economic environment could also have an impact on our foreign exchange forward contracts if our counterparties' credit deteriorates or they are otherwise unable to perform their obligations. Finally, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so which could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in the future.

If we cannot effectively manage our international operations, and successfully implement our international expansion plans, or comply with evolving laws and regulations, our revenues may not increase, and our business and results of operations would be harmed.

For the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, we recognized approximately 55%, 55% and 57%, respectively, of our revenues outside the U.S. We currently operate outside of the U.S. in Canada, Brazil, Colombia, EMEA and Asia-Pacific.

To date, the network neutrality of our IBX data centers and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our acquired IBX data centers in the Asia-Pacific region, the limited number of carriers available reduces that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating offerings and pricing to be competitive in those markets. In addition, we are currently undergoing expansions or evaluating expansion opportunities outside of the U.S. Undertaking and managing expansions in foreign jurisdictions may present unanticipated challenges to us.

Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including:

•

the costs of customizing IBX data centers for foreign countries;

•

protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition;

•

greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including negotiating with foreign labor unions or workers' councils;

•

difficulties in managing across cultures and in foreign languages;

•

political and economic instability;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

difficulties in repatriating funds from certain countries;

•

our ability to obtain, transfer or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to our business;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory, tax and political environments such as the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union ("Brexit");

•

our ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;

•

compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws;

•

compliance with economic and trade sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury; and



•

compliance with evolving governmental regulation with which we have little experience.

Geo-political events, such as Brexit, may increase the likelihood of the listed risks to occur. With respect to Brexit, it is possible that the level of economic activity in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities in these regions which could have an adverse impact on our business and employees in EMEA and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic and trade sanctions, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our offerings in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks and manage these difficulties.

Economic and political uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.

We conduct business and are contemplating expansion in developing markets with economies and governments that tend to be more volatile than those in the U.S. and Western Europe. The risk of doing business in developing markets such as Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Oman, Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings. Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability, fraud or corruption and other non-economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. If we are deemed to be not in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to successfully manage economic, political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect our business.

Terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility contribute to a climate of political and economic uncertainty. Due to existing or developing circumstances, we may need to incur additional costs in the future to provide enhanced security, including cyber security, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX data centers.

Sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. We have established an "at-the-market" stock offering program (the "ATM Program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock to or through sales agents up to established limits. By the end of 2018, we completed sales having an aggregate gross proceeds of $750.0 million, thereby completing a previously authorized program, and subsequently received authorization for up to an additional $750.0 million. We may also seek authorization to sell additional shares of common stock under the ATM Program once we have reached the current $750.0 million limit which could lead to additional dilution for our stockholders. Please see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for sales of our common stock under the ATM Program to date.

The market price of our stock may continue to be highly volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.

The market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. General economic and market conditions, and market conditions for telecommunications and real estate investment trust stocks in general, may affect the market price of our common stock.

Announcements by us or others, or speculations about our future plans, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These may relate to:

•

our operating results or forecasts;



•

new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us, including issuances through our ATM Program;

•

increases in market interest rates and changes in other general market and economic conditions, including inflationary concerns;

•

changes to our capital allocation, tax planning or business strategy;

•

our qualification for taxation as a REIT and our declaration of distributions to our stockholders;

•

changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;

•

changes in management or key personnel;

•

developments in our relationships with customers;

•

announcements by our customers or competitors;

•

changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;

•

governmental investigations;

•

changes in the ratings of our debt or stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;

•

our purchase or development of real estate and/or additional IBX data centers;

•

our acquisitions of complementary businesses; or

•

the operational performance of our IBX data centers.

The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for telecommunications companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets may affect the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and/or damages, and divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.

If we are not able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or obtain external financing, our ability to fund incremental expansion plans may be limited.

Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, obligations to service our debt and the cash outlays associated with our REIT distribution requirements, are, and will continue to be, a substantial burden on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to prioritize projects or curtail capital expenditures which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we operate internationally could harm our results of operations.

We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the majority of revenues and costs in our international operations are denominated in foreign currencies. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, our sales and revenues could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby making our offerings more expensive in local currencies. We are also exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our international operations. To the extent we are paying contractors in foreign currencies, our operations could cost more than anticipated as a result of declines in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. In addition, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates have a direct impact on how our international results of operations translate into U.S. dollars.

Although we currently undertake, and may decide in the future to further undertake, foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. In addition, REIT compliance rules may restrict our ability to enter into hedging transactions. Therefore, any weakness of the U.S. dollar may have a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the currencies in the foreign countries in which we operate may translate into more U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate, our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be negatively impacted as amounts in foreign currencies will generally translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For additional information on foreign currency risks, refer to our discussion of foreign currency risk in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.

Our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty's liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of their derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract.

Changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, including changes to tax rates, may adversely affect our financial statements and cash taxes.

We are a U.S. company with global subsidiaries and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (although currently limited due to our taxation as a REIT) and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. The U.S. government has also recently changed tax laws in the U.S. and the governments of many of the countries in which we operate are actively discussing changes to foreign tax laws. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no certainty that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax returns or as a result of further changes to the tax laws and interpretations thereof. The nature and timing of any future changes to each jurisdiction's tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities cannot be predicted with any accuracy but could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position or cash flows.

We may be vulnerable to security breaches which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.

We face risks associated with unauthorized access to our computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers' operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. As techniques used to breach security change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred, or implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, we may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We maintain insurance coverage for cyber risks, but such coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.

We offer professional services to our customers where we consult on data center solutions and assist with implementations. We also offer managed services in certain of our foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we manage the data center infrastructure for our customers. The access to our clients' networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our clients' networks or data will be improperly accessed. We may also design our clients' cloud storage systems in such a way that exposes our clients to increased risk of data breach.  If Equinix were held to be responsible for any such a breach, it could result in a significant loss to Equinix, including damage to Equinix's client relationships, harm to our brand and reputation, and legal liability.

We are continuing to invest in our expansion efforts but may not have sufficient customer demand in the future to realize expected returns on these investments.

We are considering the acquisition or lease of additional properties and the construction of new IBX data centers beyond those expansion projects already announced. We will be required to commit substantial operational and financial resources to these IBX data centers, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have sufficient customer demand in those markets to support these centers once they are built. In addition, unanticipated technological changes could affect customer requirements for data centers, and we may not have built such requirements into our new IBX data centers. Either of these contingencies, if they were to occur, could make it difficult for us to realize expected or reasonable returns on these investments.

Our offerings have a long sales cycle that may harm our revenue and operating results.

A customer's decision to purchase our offerings typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX data centers until they are confident that the IBX data center has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Furthermore, we may devote significant time and resources to pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenues. We have also significantly expanded our sales force in recent years, and it will take time for these new hires to become fully productive.



Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results, which could harm our ability to meet our forecasts and cause volatility in our stock price.

Any failure of our physical infrastructure or offerings, or damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results.

Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable solutions. We must safehouse our customers' infrastructure and equipment located in our IBX data centers and ensure our IBX data centers and non-IBX offices remain operational. We own certain of our IBX data centers, but others are leased by us, and we rely on the landlord for basic maintenance of our leased IBX data centers and office buildings. If such landlord has not maintained a leased property sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from the center which could be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, we continue to acquire IBX data centers not built by us. If we discover that these buildings and their infrastructure assets are not in the condition we expected when they were acquired, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs to repair or upgrade the centers.

Our office buildings and IBX data centers are subject to failure resulting from, and infrastructure within such IBX data centers is at risk from, numerous factors, including:

•

human error;

•

equipment failure;

•

physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;

•

fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;

•

extreme temperatures;

•

water damage;

•

fiber cuts;

•

power loss;

•

terrorist acts;

•

sabotage and vandalism; and

•

failure of business partners who provide our resale products.

Problems at one or more of our IBX data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. We have service level commitment obligations to certain customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our IBX data centers are critical to many of our customers' businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that one of our customers brings a lawsuit against us as a result of a problem at one of our IBX data centers and we may decide to reach settlements with affected customers irrespective of any such contractual limitations. Any such settlement may result in a reduction of revenue under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results.

Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions and elsewhere, some of which have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.

We are currently making significant investments in our back office information technology systems and processes.  Difficulties from or disruptions to these efforts may interrupt our normal operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.

We have been investing heavily in our back office information technology systems and processes for a number of years and expect such investment to continue for the foreseeable future in support of our pursuit of global, scalable solutions across all geographies and functions that we operate in.  These continuing investments include: 1) ongoing improvements to the customer experience from initial quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition process; 2) integration of recently-acquired operations onto our various information technology systems; and 3) implementation of new tools and technologies to either further streamline



and automate processes, such as our fixed asset procure to disposal process, or to support our compliance with evolving U.S. GAAP, such as the new revenue accounting, derivatives and hedging and leasing standards.  As a result of our continued work on these projects, we may experience difficulties with our systems, management distraction and significant business disruptions. For example, difficulties with our systems may interrupt our ability to accept and deliver customer orders and may adversely impact our overall financial operations, including our accounts payable, accounts receivables, general ledger, fixed assets, revenue recognition, close processes, internal financial controls and our ability to otherwise run and track our business. We may need to expend significant attention, time and resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions. All of these changes to our financial systems also create an increased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting until such systems are stabilized. Such significant investments in our back office systems may take longer to complete and cost more than originally planned. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits we hoped to achieve and there is a risk of an impairment charge if we decide that portions of these projects will not ultimately benefit the company or are de-scoped. Finally, the collective impact of these changes to our business has placed significant demands on impacted employees across multiple functions, increasing the risk of errors and control deficiencies in our financial statements, distraction from the effective operation of our business and difficulty in attracting and retaining employees. Any such difficulties or disruptions may adversely affect our business and operating results.

Inadequate or inaccurate external and internal information, including budget and planning data, could lead to inaccurate financial forecasts and inappropriate financial decisions.

Our financial forecasts are dependent on estimates and assumptions regarding budget and planning data, market growth, foreign exchange rates, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in the business, fund internal growth, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet our debt obligations. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. However, if our external and internal information is inadequate, our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts and cause us to make inappropriate financial decisions. Any material variation between our financial forecasts and our actual results may also adversely affect our future profitability, stock price and stockholder confidence.

The level of insurance coverage that we purchase may prove to be inadequate.

We carry liability, property, business interruption and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our company. We select the types of insurance, the limits and the deductibles based on our specific risk profile, the cost of the insurance coverage versus its perceived benefit and general industry standards. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions for events such as war and nuclear reaction. We purchase minimal levels of earthquake insurance for certain of our IBX data centers, but for most of our data centers, including many in California, we have elected to self-insure. The earthquake and flood insurance that we do purchase would be subject to high deductibles. Any of the limits of insurance that we purchase, including those for cyber risks, could prove to be inadequate, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our construction of additional new IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions could involve significant risks to our business.

In order to sustain our growth in certain of our existing and new markets, we may have to expand an existing data center, lease a new facility or acquire suitable land, with or without structures, to build new IBX data centers from the ground up. Expansions or new builds are currently underway, or being contemplated, in many of our markets. These construction projects expose us to many risks which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Some of the risks associated with these projects include:

•

construction delays;

•

lack of availability and delays for data center equipment, including items such as generators and switchgear;

•

unexpected budget changes;

•

increased prices for building supplies, raw materials and data center equipment;

•

labor availability, labor disputes and work stoppages with contractors, subcontractors and other third parties;

•

unanticipated environmental issues and geological problems; and

•

delays related to permitting from public agencies and utility companies.



Additionally, all construction related projects require us to carefully select and rely on the experience of one or more designers, general contractors, and associated subcontractors during the design and construction process. Should a designer, general contractor or significant subcontractor experience financial problems or other problems during the design or construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and/or other negative impacts to our expected returns.

Site selection is also a critical factor in our expansion plans. There may not be suitable properties available in our markets with the necessary combination of high power capacity and fiber connectivity, or selection may be limited. Thus, while we may prefer to locate new IBX data centers adjacent to our existing locations, it may not always be possible. In the event we decide to build new IBX data centers separate from our existing IBX data centers, we may provide interconnection solutions to connect these two centers. Should these solutions not provide the necessary reliability to sustain connection, this could result in lower interconnection revenue and lower margins and could have a negative impact on customer retention over time.

Environmental regulations may impose upon us new or unexpected costs.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the generation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations also impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for investigation and cleanup costs on current and former owners and operators of real property and persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances and materials such as petroleum fuel for emergency generators, as well as batteries, cleaning solutions and other materials. In addition, we lease, own or operate real property at which hazardous substances and regulated materials have been used in the past. At some of our locations, hazardous substances or regulated materials are known to be present in soil or groundwater, and there may be additional unknown hazardous substances or regulated materials present at sites we own, operate or lease. At some of our locations, there are land use restrictions in place relating to earlier environmental cleanups that do not materially limit our use of the sites. To the extent any hazardous substances or any other substance or material must be cleaned up or removed from our property, we may be responsible under applicable laws, regulations or leases for the removal or cleanup of such substances or materials, the cost of which could be substantial.

Electricity is a material cost in connection with our business, and an increase in the cost of electricity could adversely affect us. The generators that provide electricity to our facilities are subject to environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements that are subject to material change, which could result in increases in generators' compliance costs that may be passed through to us. Regulations recently promulgated by the U.S. EPA could limit air emissions from power plants, restrict discharges of cooling water, and otherwise impose new operational restraints on conventional power plants that could increase costs of electricity. In addition, we are directly subject to environmental, health and safety laws regulating air emissions, storm water management and other issues arising in our business. For example, our emergency generators are subject to state and federal regulations governing air pollutants, which could limit the operation of those generators or require the installation of new pollution control technologies. While environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon our operations, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, can lead to violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits, and to additional unexpected operational limitations or costs.

Regulation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions could increase the cost of electricity by reducing amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels, by requiring the use of more expensive generating methods or by imposing taxes or fees upon electricity generation or use. The U.S. EPA finalized a regulation in October 2015, called the "Clean Power Plan," that was intended to reduce GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The Clean Power Plan was challenged in court and the rule has not been implemented because litigation is ongoing. In August 2018, the U.S. EPA issued a proposed rule that would replace the Clean Power Plan with the "Affordable Clean Energy" rule. Under the Affordable Clean Energy rule, coal-fired power plants will be required to make efficiency improvements to reduce their GHG emissions.  The U.S. EPA expects to finalize the Affordable Clean Energy rule in 2019, but the rule will likely be challenged in court, which may delay its implementation. While we do not expect these regulatory developments to materially increase our costs of electricity, the costs remain difficult to predict or estimate.

State regulations also have the potential to increase our costs of obtaining electricity. Certain states, like California, also have issued or may enact environmental regulations that could materially affect our facilities and electricity costs. California has limited GHG emissions from new and existing conventional power plants by imposing regulatory caps and by selling or auctioning the rights to emission allowances. Washington, Oregon and Massachusetts have issued regulations to implement similar carbon cap and trade programs, and other states are considering proposals to limit carbon emissions through cap and trade programs, carbon pricing programs and other mechanisms. Some states limit carbon emissions through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ("RGGI") cap and trade program. State programs have not had a material adverse effect on our electricity costs to date, but due to the market-driven nature of some of the programs, they could have a material adverse effect on electricity costs in the future. Such laws and regulations are also subject to change at any time.



Aside from regulatory requirements, we have separately undertaken efforts to procure energy from renewable energy projects in order to support new renewables development. The costs of procuring such energy may exceed the costs of procuring electricity from existing sources, such as existing utilities or electric service provided through conventional grids. These efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional electricity from existing sources.

If we are unable to recruit or retain key executives and qualified personnel, our business could be harmed

.

In connection with the evolving needs of our customers and our business, and under the direction of our new chief executive officer, we have undertaken a review of our organizational architecture. To the extent that we make changes to our organizational architecture as a result of that review, there can be no assurances that the changes won't result in attrition, or that any changes will result in increased organizational effectiveness. We must also continue to identify, hire, train and retain key personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical, strategic and marketing skills required for our company's growth. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent.

The failure to recruit and retain necessary key executives and personnel could cause disruption, harm our business and hamper our ability to grow our company.

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

The global multi-tenant data center market is highly fragmented. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than

1,200

companies that provide these offerings around the world. Equinix competes with these firms which vary in terms of their data center offerings. We must continue to evolve our product strategy and be able to differentiate our IBX data centers and product offerings from those of our competitors.

As our customers evolve their IT strategies, we must remain flexible and evolve along with new technologies and industry and market shifts. Ineffective planning and execution in our cloud and product development strategies may cause difficulty in sustaining competitive advantage in our products and services.

We are also in discussions with a targeted set of hyperscale customers to develop capacity to serve their larger footprint needs by leveraging existing capacity and dedicated hyperscale builds. We have announced our intention to seek a joint venture partner for certain of our hyperscale builds. There can be no assurances that we find such partner or that we are able to successfully meet the needs of these customers.

Some of our competitors may adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they are not highly leveraged or have lower return thresholds than we do. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled communication services or cloud services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX data centers. Similarly, with growing acceptance of cloud-based technologies, we are at risk of losing customers that may decide to fully leverage cloud infrastructure offerings instead of managing their own. Competitors could also operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share.

Failure to compete successfully may materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Our business could be harmed by prolonged power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general lack of availability of electrical resources.

Our IBX data centers are susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations, especially internationally, on the availability of adequate power resources.

Power outages, including, but not limited to those relating to large storms, earthquakes, fires and tsunamis, could harm our customers and our business. We attempt to limit our exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies; however, we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely even with these protections in place. Some of our IBX data centers are located in leased buildings where, depending upon the lease requirements and number of tenants involved, we may or may not control some or all of the infrastructure including generators and fuel tanks. As a result, in the event of a power outage, we may be dependent upon the landlord, as well as the utility company, to restore the power.

In addition, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy, and although contractual price increase clauses exist in the majority of our customer agreements, we may not always choose to pass these increased costs on to our customers.



In each of our markets, we rely on third parties to provide a sufficient amount of power for current and future customers. At the same time, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, some customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. We generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from their installed circuits. This means that we could face power limitations in our IBX data centers. This could have a negative impact on the effective available capacity of a given center and limit our ability to grow our business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.

We may also have difficulty obtaining sufficient power capacity for potential expansion sites in new or existing markets. We may experience significant delays and substantial increased costs demanded by the utilities to provide the level of electrical service required by our current IBX data center designs.

On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E”), the public utility that serves the area in which some of our facilities are located, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco (“Bankruptcy Court”). PG&E announced that it filed for bankruptcy to facilitate the resolution of liabilities in connection with the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires. It is possible that, during its bankruptcy, PG&E may seek permission from the Bankruptcy Court to reject, i.e., breach, certain burdensome executory contracts, including high-priced power purchase agreements and other agreements under which PG&E procures electricity for distribution to customers like us. It is not certain that PG&E will be able to obtain such relief. Just before the bankruptcy filing, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) ruled that its approval is required before PG&E may reject any FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power agreements. If PG&E seeks and is allowed to reject power agreements, it is difficult to predict the consequences of any such action for us but they could potentially include procuring electricity from more expensive sources, reducing the availability and reliability of electricity supplied to our facilities and relying on a larger percentage of electricity generated by fossil fuels, any of which could reduce supplies of electricity available to our operations or increase our costs of electricity.

The use of high power density equipment may limit our ability to fully utilize our older IBX data centers.

Some customers have increased their use of high power density equipment, such as blade servers, in our IBX data centers which has increased the demand for power on a per cabinet basis. Because many of our IBX data centers were built a number of years ago, the current demand for power may exceed the designed electrical capacity in these centers. As power, not space, is a limiting factor in many of our IBX data centers, our ability to fully utilize those IBX data centers may be impacted. The ability to increase the power capacity of an IBX data center, should we decide to, is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the local utility's ability to provide additional power; the length of time required to provide such power; and/or whether it is feasible to upgrade the electrical infrastructure of an IBX data center to deliver additional power to customers. Although we are currently designing and building to a higher power specification than that of many of our older IBX data centers, there is a risk that demand will continue to increase and our IBX data centers could become underutilized sooner than expected.

If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation of our controls resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2018, in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective. Our ability to manage our operations and growth, through, for example, the integration of Metronode, Infomart Dallas, Itconic, and Zenium, the adoption of new accounting principles and tax laws, and our overhaul of our back office systems that, for example, support the customer experience from initial quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition process, will require us to further develop our controls and reporting systems and implement or amend new or existing controls and reporting systems in those areas where the implementation and integration is still ongoing. All of these changes to our financial systems and the implementation and integration of acquisitions create an increased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. If, in the future, our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, or if a material weakness is identified in our controls over financial reporting, our financial results may be adversely affected. Investors may also lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could adversely affect our stock price.

Our operating results may fluctuate.

We have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuations in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

•

fluctuations of foreign currencies in the markets in which we operate;

•

the timing and magnitude of depreciation and interest expense or other expenses related to the acquisition, purchase or construction of additional IBX data centers or the upgrade of existing IBX data centers;

•

demand for space, power and solutions at our IBX data centers;



•

changes in general economic conditions, such as an economic downturn, or specific market conditions in the telecommunications and internet industries, both of which may have an impact on our customer base;

•

charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions due to, among other things, impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired, identification of additional assumed contingent liabilities or revised estimates to restructure an acquired company's operations;

•

the duration of the sales cycle for our offerings and our ability to ramp our newly-hired sales persons to full productivity within the time period we have forecasted;

•

restructuring charges or reversals of restructuring charges, which may be necessary due to revised sublease assumptions, changes in strategy or otherwise;

•

acquisitions or dispositions we may make;

•

the financial condition and credit risk of our customers;

•

the provision of customer discounts and credits;

•

the mix of current and proposed products and offerings and the gross margins associated with our products and offerings;

•

the timing required for new and future IBX data centers to open or become fully utilized;

•

competition in the markets in which we operate;

•

conditions related to international operations;

•

increasing repair and maintenance expenses in connection with aging IBX data centers;

•

lack of available capacity in our existing IBX data centers to generate new revenue or delays in opening new or acquired IBX data centers that delay our ability to generate new revenue in markets which have otherwise reached capacity;

•

changes in rent expense as we amend our IBX data center leases in connection with extending their lease terms when their initial lease term expiration dates approach or changes in shared operating costs in connection with our leases, which are commonly referred to as common area maintenance expenses;

•

the timing and magnitude of other operating expenses, including taxes, expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, operations and acquisitions, if any, of complementary businesses and assets;

•

the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power;

•

changes in employee stock-based compensation;

•

overall inflation;

•

increasing interest expense due to any increases in interest rates and/or potential additional debt financings;

•

changes in our tax planning strategies or failure to realize anticipated benefits from such strategies;

•

changes in income tax benefit or expense; and

•

changes in or new GAAP as periodically released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").

Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Prior to 2008, we had generated net losses every fiscal year since inception. It is possible that we may not be able to generate net income on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. In addition, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.

Our days sales outstanding ("DSO") may be negatively impacted by process and system upgrades and acquisitions.

Our DSO may be negatively impacted by ongoing process and system upgrades which can impact our customers' experience in the short term, together with integrating recent acquisitions into our processes and systems, which may have a negative impact on our operating cash flows, liquidity and financial performance.

Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. GAAP.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and financial results. In addition, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require us to make changes to our systems, processes and controls, which could require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems upon or following the adoption of these standards. For example, we adopted the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and right-of-use liabilities related to operating leases. As a result, we will record significant operating lease obligations on our balance sheet and



make other changes in our financial statements, which will have a material effect on our financial statements. We are also implementing a new lease accounting tool, which may impact our accounting and reporting process. This, and other future changes to accounting rules, could have a material adverse effect on the reporting of our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding the accounting standard updates, see "Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted" and "Accounting Standards Adopted" sections of Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, or impairment charges to our property, plant and equipment, which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, such as changing market conditions or any changes in key assumptions. If the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.

We also periodically monitor the remaining net book values of our property, plant and equipment, including at the individual IBX data center level. Although each individual IBX data center is currently performing in accordance with our expectations, the possibility that one or more IBX data centers could begin to under-perform relative to our expectations is possible and may also result in non-cash impairment charges.

These charges could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We have incurred substantial losses in the past and may incur additional losses in the future.

As of

December 31, 2018

, our retained earnings were

$889.9 million

. Although we have generated net income for each fiscal year since 2008, except for the year ended December 31, 2014, we are currently investing heavily in our future growth through the build out of multiple additional IBX data centers, expansions of IBX data centers and acquisitions of complementary businesses. As a result, we will incur higher depreciation and other operating expenses, as well as acquisition costs and interest expense, that may negatively impact our ability to sustain profitability in future periods unless and until these new IBX data centers generate enough revenue to exceed their operating costs and cover the additional overhead needed to scale our business for this anticipated growth. The current global financial uncertainty may also impact our ability to sustain profitability if we cannot generate sufficient revenue to offset the increased costs of our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data centers currently under construction. In addition, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of any acquired companies, as well as the additional interest expense associated with debt financing we have undertaken to fund our growth initiatives, may also negatively impact our ability to sustain profitability. Finally, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

The failure to obtain favorable terms when we renew our IBX data center leases, or the failure to renew such leases, could harm our business and results of operations.

While we own certain of our IBX data centers, others are leased under long-term arrangements with lease terms expiring at various dates through


. These leased centers have all been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX data centers. Most of our IBX data center leases have renewal options available to us. However, many of these renewal options provide for the rent to be set at then-prevailing market rates. To the extent that then-prevailing market rates or negotiated rates are higher than present rates, these higher costs may adversely impact our business and results of operations, or we may decide against renewing the lease. In the event that an IBX data center lease does not have a renewal option, or we fail to exercise a renewal option in a timely fashion and lose our right to renew the lease, we may not be successful in negotiating a renewal of the lease with the landlord. A failure to renew a lease could force us to exit a building prematurely, which could disrupt our business, harm our customer relationships, expose us to liability under our customer contracts, cause us to take impairment charges and affect our operating results negatively.

We depend on a number of third parties to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers; if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our operating results and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.

The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers' fiber networks in our IBX data centers is critical to our ability to retain and attract new customers. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such, we rely on third parties to provide our customers with carrier services. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the telecommunications carriers' customers to encourage them to invest the capital and operating resources required to connect from their centers to our IBX data centers. Carriers will likely evaluate the



revenue opportunity of an IBX data center based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot provide assurance that each and every carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX data centers or that once a carrier has decided to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers that it will continue to do so for any period of time.

Our new IBX data centers require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX data centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. Any hardware or fiber failures on this network may result in significant loss of connectivity to our new IBX data center expansions. This could affect our ability to attract new customers to these IBX data centers or retain existing customers.

If the establishment of highly diverse internet connectivity to our IBX data centers does not occur, is materially delayed or is discontinued, or is subject to failure, our operating results and cash flow will be adversely affected.

We have government customers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.

We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and foreign governments. Some of these customers may terminate all or part of their contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Some of our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, some of our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations.

Additionally, government contracts often have unique terms and conditions, such as most favored customer obligations, and are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.

Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, including key magnet customers, failure to attract, grow and retain this base of customers could harm our business and operating results.

Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including enterprises, cloud, digital content and financial companies, and network service providers. We consider certain of these customers to be key magnets in that they draw in other customers. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX data center, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX data centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the mix of our offerings, the overall mix of customers, the presence of key customers attracting business through vertical market ecosystems, the IBX data center's operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our offerings. However, some of our customers may face competitive pressures and may ultimately not be successful or may be consolidated through merger or acquisition. If these customers do not continue to use our IBX data centers it may be disruptive to our business. Finally, the uncertain global economic climate may harm our ability to attract and retain customers if customers slow spending, or delay decision-making on our offerings, or if customers begin to have difficulty paying us and we experience increased churn in our customer base. Any of these factors may hinder the development, growth and retention of a balanced customer base and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be subject to securities class action and other litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations.

We may be subject to securities class action or other litigation. For example, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and divert management's attention and resources. Results cannot be predicted with certainty and an adverse outcome in litigation could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief. Further, any payments made in settlement may directly reduce our revenue under U.S. GAAP and could negatively impact our operating results for the period.  For all of these reasons, litigation could seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.

We cannot make assurances that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. We also are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement.



Government regulation may adversely affect our business.

Various laws and governmental regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, governing internet-related services, related communications services and information technologies remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. For example, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") recently overturned network neutrality rules, which may result in material changes in the regulations and contribution regime affecting us and our customers. Furthermore, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures are reviewing and considering changes to the new FCC rules making the future of network neutrality and its impact on Equinix uncertain. There may also be forthcoming regulation in the U.S. in the areas of cybersecurity, data privacy and data security, any of which could impact Equinix and our customers. Similarly, data privacy regulations outside of the U.S. continue to evolve and must be addressed by Equinix as a global company.

We remain focused on whether and how existing and changing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, data flows/data localization, carbon emissions impact, and taxation apply to the internet and to related offerings such as ours; and substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the continuing development of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the internet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and their service providers.

The adoption, or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet and our business, or interpretations of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Industry consolidation may have a negative impact on our business model.

If customers combine businesses, they may require less colocation space, which could lead to churn in our customer base. Regional competitors may also consolidate to become a global competitor. Consolidation of our customers and/or our competitors may present a risk to our business model and have a negative impact on our revenues.

We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts.

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a stockholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include:

•

ownership limitations and transfer restrictions relating to our stock that are intended to facilitate our compliance with certain REIT rules relating to share ownership;

•

authorization for the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock;

•

the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;

•

limits on the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;

•

limits on stockholder action by written consent; and

•

advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders in certain situations, may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.

Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT

We may not remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. We believe that our organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), such that we will continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT or that we will remain so qualified. Qualification for taxation as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable REIT provisions of the Code.

If, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;



•

we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and

•

we would not be eligible to elect REIT status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT.

Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced.

As a REIT, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax.

We paid quarterly distributions in 2018 and have declared a quarterly distribution to be paid on

March 20, 2019

. The amount, timing and form of any future distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our Board of Directors. To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our REIT taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, interest expense deductions limited by Section 163(j) of the Code, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.

To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the Code.

We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.

Due to the size and timing of future distributions, including any distributions made to satisfy REIT distribution requirements, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings.

Any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our REIT distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our indebtedness. A significant increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Significantly more financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see other risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. Depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.

To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. For example, under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. Similar rules apply to other nonqualifying assets. These limitations may affect our ability to make large investments in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets. In addition, in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax



at regular corporate income tax rates for our undistributed REIT taxable income, as well as U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates for income recognized by our TRSs; we also pay taxes in the foreign jurisdictions in which our international assets and operations are held and conducted regardless of our REIT status. Because of these distribution requirements, we will likely not be able to fund future capital needs and investments from operating cash flow. As such, compliance with REIT tests may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of significant nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-real estate activities.

Our ability to fully deduct our interest expense may be limited, or we may be required to adjust the tax depreciation of our real property in order to maintain the full deductibility of our interest expense.

The Code limits interest deductions for businesses, whether in corporate or passthrough form, to the sum of the taxpayer's business interest income for the tax year and 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for that tax year. This limitation does not apply to an "electing real property trade or business". Although REITs are permitted to make such an election, we do not currently intend to do so. If we so elect in the future, depreciable real property that we hold (including specified improvements) would be required to be depreciated for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the alternative depreciation system of the Code, which generally imposes a class life for depreciable real property as long as forty years.

As a REIT, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our TRSs.

Our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other nonqualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs. Specifically, if our TRSs become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our TRSs in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.

In addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our TRSs is generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.

Our extensive use of TRSs, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.

Our operations include an extensive use of TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. Further, a substantial portion of our TRSs are overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also negatively impact our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.

The Code imposes limitations on the ability of our TRSs to utilize specified income tax deductions, including limits on the use of net operating losses and limits on the deductibility of interest expense.

Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.

A REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures and any stock repurchase program. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate.

Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.

Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes.



In addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT.

A portion of our business is conducted through wholly-owned TRSs because certain of our business activities could generate nonqualifying REIT income as currently structured and operated. The income of our U.S. TRSs will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. In addition, our international assets and operations will continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.

We will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%) on gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset that we or our qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRSs") hold following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.

The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-U.S. operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our TRSs, which we presently do. This increases the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs are subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, hedging losses in any of our TRSs may not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the TRSs.

Distributions payable by REITs generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates.

Dividends payable by U.S. corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to "qualified dividends." Distributions paid by REITs generally are not treated as "qualified dividends" under the Code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. However, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026, REIT dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the Code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. More favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate "qualified" dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a REIT is less attractive than an investment in a non-REIT entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock, though they may not be successful in preserving our qualification for taxation as a REIT.

In order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elected to be taxed as a REIT. In addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying REIT income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the Code. Subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. We refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with REIT tax rules. The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. Even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these



provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. If the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and, as a result, we fail to satisfy the REIT tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.

In addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders.

At any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. In addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of TRSs, particularly non-U.S. TRSs.

In addition, December 2017 legislation made substantial changes to the Code, particularly as it relates to the taxation of both corporate income and international income. Among those changes are a significant permanent reduction in the generally applicable corporate income tax rate and modifications to the calculation of taxable income, including changes to credits and deductions available to businesses and individuals. This legislation also imposes additional limitations on the deduction of net operating losses, which may in the future cause us to make additional distributions that will be taxable to our stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. The effect of these and other changes made in this legislation is still uncertain in many respects, both in terms of their direct effect on the taxation of an investment in our common stock and their indirect effect on the value of assets owned by us. Furthermore, many of the provisions of the new law will require additional guidance in order to assess their effect. It is also possible that there will be subsequent legislative amendments proposed with respect to the new law, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders. Our stockholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors about the potential effects that changes in law may have on them and their ownership of our common stock.

We could incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to integrate an acquisition target in compliance with the requirements to qualify for taxation as a REIT.

We periodically explore and occasionally consummate merger and acquisition transactions. When we consummate these transactions, we structure the acquisition to successfully manage the REIT income, asset, and distribution tests that we must satisfy. We believe that we have and will in the future successfully integrate our acquisition targets in a manner that has and will allow us to timely satisfy the REIT tests applicable to us, but if we failed or in the future fail to do so, then we could jeopardize or lose our qualification for taxation as a REIT, particularly if we were not eligible to utilize relief provisions set forth in the Code.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following consolidated statement of operations data for the five years ended

December 31, 2018

and the consolidated balance sheet data as of

December 31, 2018

, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. The following selected consolidated financial data for the five years ended

December 31, 2018

and as of

December 31, 2018

, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We completed acquisitions of Metronode and Infomart Dallas in April, 2018, the Zenium data center business in Istanbul and Itconic in October 2017, certain colocation business from Verizon in May 2017, IO UK's data center operating business in Slough, United Kingdom in February 2017 (the "IO Acquisition), certain Paris IBX data centers in August 2016 (the "Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition"), Telecity Group plc in January 2016, Bit-isle in November 2015 and Nimbo Technologies Inc. ("Nimbo") in January 2015. We also completed the acquisition of the 100% controlling equity interest in ALOG Data Centers do Brasil S.A. ("ALOG") in July 2014. We sold solar power assets of Bit-isle in November 2016 and eight of our IBX data centers located in the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany in July 2016. For further information on our acquisitions and divestitures during the three years ended

December 31, 2018

, refer to Note 3, Note 5 and Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



(1)

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The impacts are primarily related to the costs to obtain a customer contract and from the recognition of installation revenue, which are recognized over the contract period, rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected the adoption of Topic 606. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2)

The higher income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributed to the de-recognition of $324.1 million of net deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in December 2014, when our Board of Directors formally approved our conversion to a REIT and we reassessed the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of our U.S. operations included in the REIT structure.

(3)

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $10.95 per share of special distribution and $6.76 per share of quarterly cash dividend. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $7.57 per share of special distribution.



(1)

The company adopted ASU 2015-03 during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, debt issuance costs of $35.5 million were reclassified from other assets to debt as of December 31, 2014.

(2)

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of

$269.8 million

as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to the costs to obtain a customer contract and from the recognition of installation revenue, which are recognized over the contract period, rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In 2018, as more fully described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we sold

930,934

shares of our common stock for approximately

$388.2 million

, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and estimated equity offering costs under our ATM program launched in 2017 (the "2017 ATM Program"). As of

December 31, 2018

, no shares remained available for sale under the 2017 ATM Program. In December 2018, we launched another ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of

$750.0 million

of our common stock in "at the market" transactions (the "2018 ATM Program"). As of

December 31, 2018

, no sales have been made under the 2018 ATM Program.

In July 2018, as more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement to add a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of ¥47.5 billion (the "JPY Term Loan"). Concurrent with the closing of our JPY Term Loan, we drew down the full ¥47.5 billion of the JPY Term Loan, or approximately $424.7 million, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan of ¥43.8 billion, or approximately $391.3 million. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.2 million during the third quarter of 2018 in connection therewith.

In April 2018, as more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of Metronode for a cash purchase price of

A$1.034 billion

or approximately

$804.6 million

at the exchange rate in effect on April 18, 2018 (the "Metronode Acquisition"). We accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2018.

In April 2018, as more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of Infomart Dallas for total consideration of approximately $804.0 million (the "Infomart Dallas Acquisition"), consisting of approximately $45.8 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2018.

In March 2018, as more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €750.0 million, or approximately $929.9 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 14, 2018, aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due March 15, 2024. We incurred debt issuance costs of $11.6 million related to the 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024.



Overview

Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix's leading insight and data centers around the world for the safehousing of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. The acquisitions of Infomart Dallas and Metronode expanded our total global footprint to


IBX data centers across


markets around the world. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and exchange and (iii) outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. As of

December 31, 2018

, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in Brazil, Canada, Colombia and throughout the U.S. in the Americas region; Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region.

Our data centers in


markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.

Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches


countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance, network choice and a highly scalable set of offerings.

Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rates were approximately

81%

, as of

December 31, 2018

, and

80%

, excluding the Verizon Data Center, Paris IBX Data Center, Itconic, Zenium data center and IO acquisitions, as of

December 31, 2017

. Excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately

83%

as of

December 31, 2018

. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.

Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.



Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately

3%

of our recurring revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately

38%

,

37%

and

36%

, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


.

Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.

The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.

We expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. We may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. We expect the trend that the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to grow our business.

Taxation as a REIT

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of

December 31, 2018

, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, United Arab Emirates and a portion of Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs.



As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.

On each of March 21, June 20, September 19, and December 12, 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.28 per share. We expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2018.

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") which amended U.S. federal income tax laws. The TCJA retained the REIT regime but contained many significant changes that impact a REIT's taxable income subject to distribution, particularly a REIT with global operations. As of the end of 2018, we have finalized the analysis of the major tax impact to our business by the new tax legislation. Based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe that we can continue to meet all the REIT compliance requirements in the foreseeable future and that the TCJA changes are not expected to meaningfully increase our tax liabilities in the U.S. because we expect to fully distribute our REIT taxable income.

We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.

Results of Operations

Our results of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2018

include the results of operations from the Metronode Acquisition from April 18, 2018 and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition from April 2, 2018. Our results of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2017

include the results of operations of the IO Acquisition from February 3, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition from May 1, 2017, the Zenium data center acquisition from October 6, 2017 and the Itconic Acquisition from October 9, 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the results of operations of TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016 and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition from August 1, 2016.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09") and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, collectively referred as "Topic 606." On January 1, 2018, as more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted Topic 606. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods. Under the new standard, we recognize installation revenue over the contract period rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. We also capitalize and amortize certain costs to obtain contracts, rather than expense them immediately as under the previous standard.

Discontinued Operations

We present the results of operations associated with the TelecityGroup data centers that were divested in July 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2018 or 2017.

Revenues.

Our revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas Revenues.

Revenues for our Americas region for the year ended

December 31, 2018

included approximately $210.2 million of incremental revenues from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, which closed in May 2017, and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition, which closed in April 2018. During both the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately

91%

of the regional revenues. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the Infomart Dallas and Verizon Data Center Acquisitions, growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $69.3 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Brazilian real than during the year ended

December 31, 2017

, resulting in approximately

$23.6 million

of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended

December 31, 2018

when compared to


using average exchange rates.

EMEA Revenues.

Revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended

December 31, 2018

included approximately $52.6 million of incremental revenues from the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented

30%

of regional revenues for both the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the IO, Itconic, and Zenium acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $73.2 million of revenues from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately

$54.4 million

of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

Asia-Pacific Revenues.

Revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended

December 31, 2018

included approximately $48.0 million of incremental revenues from the Metronode Acquisition, which closed in April 2018. Our revenues from Japan and Singapore, the largest revenue contributors in the Asia-Pacific region for the period, combined represented approximately

60%

and

63%

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the Metronode Acquisition, our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $59.2 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Osaka, and Singapore metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended

December 31,




, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Singapore dollar and Japanese yen than during the year ended

December 31, 2017

were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended

December 31, 2018

included approximately $115.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition. Excluding the impact from these acquisitions, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

was primarily due to (i) $10.6 million higher depreciation expense primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity; (ii) $7.6 million of higher taxes, licenses, insurance, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth; (iii) $5.8 million of higher rent and facility costs due to new fuel cell leases and IBX growth  and (iv) $15.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (

1,399

Americas cost of revenues employees as of

December 31, 2018

versus

1,339

as of

December 31, 2017

). During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately

$15.1 million

of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real during the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2017

. We expect our Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including results from recent acquisitions.

EMEA Cost of Revenues. C

ost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended

December 31, 2018

included $41.5 million of incremental cost of revenues from the IO, Itconic, and Zenium acquisitions. Excluding incremental cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $47.3 million of higher utilities costs driven by IBX expansions, increased usage and price increases; (ii) $18.4 million of higher office expenses, rent and facility costs, and repair and maintenance primarily due to an increase in expansion activity and usage due to our business growth; (iii) $49.3 million of higher depreciation and accretion expenses, primarily driven by expansion activity in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris and (iv) $19.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (

EMEA General and Administrative Expenses.

The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of lower amortization expenses as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and (ii) $8.4 million of lower consulting expenses which was largely due to the completion of TelecityGroup integration activities in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth.

Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses.

The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (453 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 358 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in rent, repair and maintenance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Acquisition Costs

.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, of which $28.5 million was related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2017 attributable to the Americas region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily in the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center, and to a lesser degree, to the Americas region.

Impairment Charges.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Gain on Asset Sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.



Income from Operations.

Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas Income from Continuing Operations.

Our Americas income from continuing operations did not change significantly year over year. While revenues increased as described above, this was largely offset by (i) an increase of $18.6 million in acquisition costs, which was primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition; (ii) additional amortization of the acquired intangible assets resulted from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (iii) higher cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

EMEA Income from Continuing Operations.

The increase in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and lower acquisition costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred $9.2 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.5 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to our acquisition of TelecityGroup. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations.

The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2016.

Interest Income.

Interest income was $13.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was driven by higher cash balances and interest yield rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.64% versus 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased to $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Term B-2 Loan borrowings of €1.0 billion and the issuance of $1.25 billion of 2027 Senior Notes in March 2017, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $22.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.

Other Income (Expense).

We recorded net other income of $9.2 million and net expense of $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, including $63.5 million in foreign currency losses recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of completing the acquisition of TelecityGroup.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment.

We recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the senior notes; (ii) $22.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of term loans under the previously outstanding credit facility; (iii) $16.7 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and financing obligations and (iv) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings.



Income Taxes.

We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and lower amount of non-deductible expenses within our EMEA operations. This is partially offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the U.S. TRSs due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA.

Adjusted EBITDA

. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas Adjusted EBITDA.

The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the U.S. dollar being generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

EMEA Adjusted EBITDA.

The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA.

The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations.



Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.

Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.

Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations.

In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.



Adjusted EBITDA

We define adjusted EBITDA as income from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):

Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "Results of Operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in "Overview".

Funds from Operations ("FFO") and AFFO

We use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.

In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.



Our FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands):

Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "Results of Operations," as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in "Overview."

Constant Currency Presentation

Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended

December 31, 2017

are used as exchange rates for the year ended

December 31, 2018

when comparing the year

with the year ended

, and average rates in effect for the year ended

when comparing the year ended

with the year ended

).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of

December 31, 2018

, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately

$11.4 billion

consisting of (a) approximately

$8,500.1 million

of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately

$1,518.9 million

from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c)

$1,390.4 million

of principal from our loans payable and mortgage (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).

We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects.

On March 14, 2018, we issued €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024. On April 2, 2018, we completed the Infomart Dallas Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $804.0 million, which was funded with approximately $45.8 million in cash and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. On April 18, 2018, we completed the Metronode Acquisition for a cash purchase price of

A$1.034 billion

or approximately

$804.6 million

at the exchange rate in effect on April 18, 2018. In July, we drew down the full amount of the JPY Term Loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on July 31, 2018, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan of ¥43.8 billion or approximately $391.3 million. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$610.7 million

of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately

$280.1 million

was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and the 2018 ATM Program as described below.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had


irrevocable letters of credit totaling

$68.5 million

issued and outstanding under the revolving facility. We had a total of approximately

$1.9 billion

of additional liquidity available to us under the Revolving Facility.

For the

year ended December 31, 2018

, we sold

930,934

shares for approximately

$388.2 million

, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and equity offering costs under our 2017 ATM Program. As of

December 31, 2018

, no shares remain available for sale under the 2017 ATM Program. In December 2018, we launched the 2018 ATM Program to sell up to $750.0 million of common stock in at the market offerings. As of

December 31, 2018

, no shares have been sold under the 2018 ATM Program.

Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing, or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.

Sources and Uses of Cash



Operating Activities

Our cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary use of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisitions of Infomart Dallas and Metronode in April 2018 and inclusion of full year operating results of the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and other acquisitions in 2017, offset by timing of collections on our receivables and increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes.

Investing Activities

The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of

$3.1 billion

, primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in 2017, partially offset by

$717.4 million

of higher capital expenditures and

$87.3 million

of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of

$2.2 billion

, primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, a decrease in proceeds from asset sales of

$803.8 million

,

$265.4 million

of higher capital expenditures and

$67.0 million

of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity.

During 2019, we anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will increase from our 2018 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during


was primarily due to (i) the issuance of €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024, or approximately

$929.9 million

in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 14, 2018; (ii) borrowing of the JPY Term Loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately

$424.7 million

at the exchange rate effective on July 31, 2018; (iii) sale of

930,934

shares under the 2017 ATM Program, for net proceeds of

$388.2 million

and (iv) proceeds from employee awards of

$50.1 million

. The proceeds were partially offset by (i) dividend distributions of

$738.6 million

; (ii) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of

$103.8 million

; (iii) repayments of mortgage and loans payable of

$447.5 million

, primarily related to the prepayment of the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan; (iv) payments of debt extinguishment costs of

$20.6 million

and (v) payments of debt issuance costs of

$12.2 million

.

Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under our previously outstanding credit facility of

€1,000.0 million

, or approximately

$1,059.8 million

at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017; (ii) the issuance of

$1,250.0 million

2027 Senior Notes; (iii) the issuance of

€1,000.0 million

2025 Euro Senior Notes, or approximately

$1,199.7 million

at the exchange rate on September 20, 2017; (iv) the issuance of

€1,000.0 million

2026 Euro Senior Notes, approximately

$1,179.0 million

at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017; (v) borrowings under our Term Loan Facility of approximately

$997.1 million

on December 12, 2017, at the exchange rate in effect on that day; (vi) the sale of common stock for net proceeds of

$2,481.4 million

and (vii) proceeds from employee awards of

$41.7 million

, partially offset by (i) repayment of the entire

$500.0 million

principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020; (ii) repayment in full of our previously outstanding credit facility of approximately

$2,207.7 million

in total at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017; (iii) dividend distributions of

$621.5 million

; (iv) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of

$93.5 million

and (v) debt issuance costs of

$81.0 million

.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i)

$1,462.9 million

repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the TelecityGroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility; (ii)

$114.4 million

repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii)

$499.5 million

payment of dividends, partially offset by

$1,168.3 million

of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our previously outstanding credit facility and Japanese Yen Term Loan.

December 31, 2018

. For further information on debt obligations, see "Debt Facilities" in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations

We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from


to


under which a total principal balance of

$1,518.9 million

remained outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

with a weighted average effective interest rate of

7.88%

. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see "Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations" in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through


. The following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of

December 31, 2018

(in thousands):

(1)

Represents principal of senior notes, term loans and other loans payable, as well as premium on mortgage payable.

(2)

Represents interest on mortgage payable, senior notes, term loan facilities and other loans payable based on their approximate interest rates as of

December 31, 2018

, as well as the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility.

(3)

Represents principal and interest.

(4)

Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals.

(5)

Represents unaccrued contractual commitments. Other contractual commitments are described below.

(6)

Represents liability, net of future accretion expense.

In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into


irrevocable letters of credit totaling

$68.5 million

under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.

We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately

$106.9 million

as of

December 31, 2018

. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.

Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of

December 31, 2018

, we were contractually committed for

$687.6 million

of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during


and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."

We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of

December 31, 2018

, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements that may contain



embedded leases to be delivered or provided during


and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of

December 31, 2018

, which total

$837.5 million

, are also reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."

Additionally, we entered into lease agreements in various locations for a total lease commitment of approximately

$262.2 million

, excluding potential lease renewals. These lease agreements will commence between February 2019 and May 2020 with lease terms of


to


years, which are not reflected in the table above.

Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of

December 31, 2018

, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see "Guarantor Arrangements" in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:

•

Accounting for income taxes;

•

Accounting for business combinations;

•

Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and

•

Accounting for property, plant and equipment.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.

We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Investment Portfolio Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

As of

December 31, 2018

, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled

$124.1 million

.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of

December 31, 2018

would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans, that bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately

$12.7 million

or decrease by a total of approximately

$5.6 million

based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of

December 31, 2018

. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.

The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and 5.000% Infomart Senior Notes, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands):

(1)

The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.

Foreign Currency Risk

A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 55.3% of our revenues and 53.5%

of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada, Colombia and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program



to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows. As of

December 31, 2018

, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of up to two years.

We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of

December 31, 2018

, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $4.5 billion, including $3.2 billion denominated in Euro, $612.7 million denominated in British Pound, $427.8 million denominated in Japanese Yen and $304.0 million denominated in Swedish Krona. As of

December 31, 2018

, we have designated $4.1 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge, except the ineffective portion and forward points, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. We did not record any ineffectiveness during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies (i.e. Euro, British Pound, Swedish Krona and Japanese Yen) and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of

December 31, 2018

, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately

$449.5 million

respectively.

For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal


, the U.S. dollar became generally stronger relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.

With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended

December 31, 2018

would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately

$137.1 million

and

$145.1 million

, respectively.

With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended

December 31, 2018

would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately

$175.1 million

and

$179.4 million

, respectively.

We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure.

Commodity Price Risk

Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.

In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.

We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of

December 31, 2018

.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed and operated to be effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal


that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We implemented certain internal controls related to the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on our financial statements to facilitate its adoption effective January 1, 2018.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equinix, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equinix, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholder’s equity and other comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable

F-1


assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.    Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

Equinix, Inc. ("Equinix" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1998. Equinix provides colocation space and related offerings. Global enterprises, content providers, financial companies and network service providers rely upon Equinix's insight and expertise to safehouse and connect their most valued information assets. The Company operates International Business Exchange

TM

("IBX

®

") data centers, or IBX data centers, across the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific geographic regions where customers directly interconnect with a network ecosystem of partners and customers. More than

1,800

network service providers offer access to the world's internet routes inside the Company's IBX data centers. This access to internet routes provides Equinix customers improved reliability and streamlined connectivity while significantly reducing costs by reaching a critical mass of networks within a centralized physical location.

The Company has been operating as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT") effective January 1, 2015. See "Income Taxes" in Note 14 below for additional information.

On April 18, 2018, the Company acquired all of the equity interests in Metronode from the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (the "Metronode Acquisition") and on April 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Infomart Dallas, including its operations and tenants, from ASB Real Estate Investments (the "Infomart Dallas Acquisition"). On October 9, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Itconic, a data center business in Spain and Portugal and on October 6, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Zenium's data center business in Istanbul. On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of certain colocation business from Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon") consisting of


data center buildings located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia (the "Verizon Data Center Acquisition"). On February 3, 2017, the Company acquired IO UK's data center operating business in Slough, United Kingdom ("IO Acquisition"). On August 1, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of Digital Realty's operating business in Paris (the "Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition"), which housed Equinix' Paris 2 and Paris 3 data centers. On January 15, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Telecity Group plc ("TelecityGroup") which provided data center solutions in Europe. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company operates


IBX data centers in


markets across

five

continents.

Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and Foreign Currency

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinix and its subsidiaries, including the acquisitions of Metronode from April 18, 2018, Infomart Dallas from April 2, 2018, Itconic from October 9, 2017, the Zenium data center from October 6, 2017, the Verizon data center business from May 1, 2017, the IO UK data center operating business from February 3, 2017, the Paris IBX Data Center from August 1, 2016, and TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including intercompany foreign currency transactions, that are anticipated to be repaid within the foreseeable future, are reported within other income (expense) on the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For additional information on the impact of foreign currencies to the Company's consolidated financial statements, see "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss" in Note 12.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S.") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquisitions, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term and Long-Term Investments

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit with original

F-9


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

maturities up to


days. Short-term investments generally consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of between


days and

one

year. Long-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of one year or more and publicly traded equity securities. Publicly traded equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in the fair values recognized within other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company's investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as "available-for-sale" investments and measured at fair values with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a net cumulative effect increase of

$2.1 million

to retained earnings. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company reviews its investment portfolio quarterly to determine if any securities may be other-than-temporarily impaired due to increased credit risk, changes in industry or sector of a certain instrument or ratings downgrades.

Equity Method Investments

The Company's investments in non-marketable equity securities are generally accounted under the equity method. For equity method investments, the Company adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings and losses of the investees and recognizes its share of income or loss in other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company records non-marketable equity investment in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviews these investments periodically to determine if any investments may be impaired considering both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value.

Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and accounts receivable. Risks associated with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are mitigated by the Company's investment policy, which limits the Company's investing to only those marketable securities rated at least A-1/P-1 Short Term Rating and A-/A3 Long Term Rating, as determined by independent credit rating agencies.

A significant portion of the Company's customer base is comprised of businesses throughout the Americas. However, a portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the Company's EMEA and Asia-Pacific operations. The following table sets forth percentages of the Company's revenues by geographic region for the years ended December 31:

No single customer accounted for greater than

10%

of accounts receivable or revenues as of or for the years ended December 31,


,


and


.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at the Company's original cost or at fair value for property, plant and equipment acquired through acquisitions, net of depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements and integral equipment at leased locations are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. Leasehold improvements acquired through acquisition are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or terms that include required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased.

EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The Company's estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment are as follows:

The Company's construction in progress includes direct and indirect expenditures for the construction and expansion of IBX data centers and is stated at original cost. The Company has contracted out substantially all of the construction and expansion efforts of its IBX data centers to independent contractors under construction contracts. Construction in progress includes costs incurred under construction contracts including project management services, engineering and schematic design services, design development, construction services and other construction-related fees and services. In addition, the Company has capitalized interest costs during the construction phase. Once an IBX data center or expansion project becomes operational, these capitalized costs are allocated to certain property, plant and equipment categories and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets.

The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of the Company's financial condition. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated discounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company did not record any impairment charges related to its property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. However, the Company recorded an impairment charge of

$7.7 million

relating to assets held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2016 as described below.

The Company enters into non-cancellable lease arrangements as the lessee primarily for its data center spaces, office spaces and equipment. Assets acquired through capital leases and other financing obligations are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, a portion of the Company's property, plant and equipment are used for revenue arrangements which are accounted for as operating leases where the Company is the lessor.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Assets and liabilities to be disposed of that meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale as set forth in the accounting standard for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. Assets are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. A component of a reporting entity or a group of components of a reporting entity that are disposed or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale should be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The accounting guidance requires a business activity that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale be reported as a discontinued operation. For further information on the Company's assets held for sale and discontinued operations, see Notes 5 and 6.

Asset Retirement Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations

The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The associated retirement costs are capitalized and included as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the Company accretes the liability in relation to the asset retirement obligations over time and the accretion expense is recorded as a cost of revenue. The Company's asset retirement obligations are primarily related to its IBX data centers, of which the majority are leased under long-term arrangements, and, in certain cases, are required to be returned to the landlords in their original condition. The majority of the Company's IBX data center leases have been subject to significant development by the Company in order to convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX data centers. The majority of the Company's IBX data centers' initial lease terms expire at various dates ranging from


to


and most of them enable the Company to extend the lease terms.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company has

three

reportable segments comprised of the 1) Americas, 2) EMEA and 3) Asia-Pacific geographic regions, which the Company also determined are its reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had goodwill attributable to its Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units.

The Company has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test, which is used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.

The Company assesses qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors considered in the assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this analysis, the Company may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by evaluating sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value. In order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, the Company utilizes the discounted cash flow and market methods. The assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow method was determined using the Company's best estimates as of the date of the impairment review.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that goodwill attributed to the Company's Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was not impaired as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its respective reporting unit, including goodwill.

Impairment assessments inherently involve judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company's assumptions as to prices, costs, growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in the Company's estimates of future cash flows. Although the Company believes the assumptions it used in its evaluation of impairment are reasonable, significant changes in any one of the Company's assumptions could produce a significantly different result. Indicators of potential impairment that might lead the Company to perform interim goodwill impairment assessments include significant and unforeseen customer losses, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant stock price decline or unanticipated competition.

All of the Company's intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. The Company performs a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated discounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company did not record any impairment charges related to its other intangible assets during the years ended December 31,


,


and


.

For further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 3 and Note 7 below.

Debt Issuance Costs

Loan fees and costs are capitalized and are amortized over the life of the related loans based on the effective interest method. Such amortization is included as a component of interest expense. Debt issuance costs related to outstanding debt are presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt obligation and debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are presented as other assets.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the value of a derivative depends on whether or not the contract has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be considered highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In order for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, there must be documentation of the risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, and how effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the Company uses a regression analysis. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows is assessed and documented at least quarterly. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged cash flows affect earnings in the same statement of operations line item as the hedged item. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in fair value of the derivative recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged occur, consistent with the original hedge strategy. For hedge relationships discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy, any related derivative amounts recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) are immediately recognized in earnings.

Foreign currency gains or losses associated with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded within other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of foreign currency embedded derivatives contained in certain of the Company's customer contracts (see "Revenue Recognition" below), which are recorded within revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

For further information on derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 8 below.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and derivative instruments represent their fair value, while the Company's accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued property, plant and equipment approximate their fair value due primarily to the short-term maturity of the related instruments. The fair value of the Company's debt, which is traded in the public debt market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company's debt, which is not publicly traded, is estimated by considering the Company's credit rating, current rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities and terms of the debt.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company measures and reports certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including its investments in money market funds, certificates of deposit, publicly traded equity securities and derivatives.

The Company also follows the accounting standard for the measurement of fair value for non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. These include:

•

Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, but not measured at fair value in subsequent reporting periods;

•

Reporting units and non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value for goodwill impairment tests;

•

Indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments;

•

Non-financial long-lived assets or asset groups measured at fair value for impairment assessments or disposal; and

•

Asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value but not subsequently measured at fair value.

For further information on fair value measurements, see Note 9 below.

Revenue

Revenue Recognition

Equinix derives more than

90%

of its revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation, which includes the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection offerings, such as cross connects and Equinix Exchange ports; (3) managed infrastructure solutions and (4) other revenues consisting of rental income from tenants or subtenants. The remainder of the Company's revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues by service lines and geographic areas are included in segment information (see Note 17). The majority of the Company's revenue contracts are classified as licenses and accounted for in accordance with Topic 606, with the exception of certain contracts that contain lease components and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, Leases.

Under the revenue accounting guidance, revenues are recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are generally billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally

one

to

three

years for IBX data center colocation customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid upfront upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term. Professional service fees and equipment sales are recognized in the period when the services were provided. For the contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct or as a series of distinct obligations if the individual performance obligations meet the series criteria. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price is determined based on overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions, geographic locations and other factors. Other judgments include determining if any variable consideration should be included in the total contract value of the arrangement such as price increases.

Revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis in accordance with the accounting standard related to reporting revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent, as the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract, bears inventory risk and has discretion in establishing the price when selling to the customer. To the extent the Company does not meet the criteria for recognizing revenue on a gross basis, the Company records the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any.

The Company guarantees certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. If these service levels are not achieved due to any failure of the physical infrastructure or offerings, or in the event of certain instances of damage to customer infrastructure within the Company's IBX data centers, the Company would reduce revenue for any credits or cash payments given to the customer. Historically, these credits and cash payments have not been significant.

Occasionally, the Company enters into contracts with customers for data center and office spaces, which contain lease components. The Company's leases with customers are generally classified as operating leases and lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Lease revenues related to data center spaces are included within the "Colocation" revenues, while lease revenues related to office space are included within the "Other" revenues.

As a result of certain customer agreements being priced in currencies different from the functional currencies of the parties involved, under applicable accounting rules, the Company is deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in these contracts. The Company assessed these embedded contracts and concluded them to be foreign currency embedded derivatives (see Note 8). These instruments are separated from their host contracts and held on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. The majority of these foreign currency embedded derivatives arise in certain of the Company's subsidiaries where the local currency is the subsidiary's functional currency and the customer contract is denominated in the U.S. dollar. Changes in their fair values are recognized within revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections result in accounts receivables, contract assets and deferred revenues. A receivable is recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for doubtful account and is recognized in the period when the Company has transferred products or provided services to its customers and when its right to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within


to


days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that the Company's contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The Company assesses collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. The Company generally does not request collateral from its customers although in certain cases the Company obtains a security interest in a customer's equipment placed in its IBX data centers or obtains a deposit. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for which the Company had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate or if they became insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, greater allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the Company's reserves. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectable are charged to bad debt expense included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount of a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic customer balances. An additional reserve is established for all other accounts based on the age of the invoices and an analysis of historical credits issued. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.

A contract asset exists when the Company has transferred products or provided services to its customers, but customer payment is contingent upon satisfaction of additional performance obligations. Certain contracts include terms related to price arrangements such as price increases and free months. The Company recognizes revenues ratably over the contract term, which could potentially give rise to contract assets during certain periods of the contract term. Contract assets are recorded in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

Deferred revenue (a contract liability) is recognized when the Company has an unconditional right to a payment before it transfers products or services to customers. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract Costs

Direct and indirect incremental costs solely related to obtaining revenue contracts are capitalized as costs of obtaining a contract, when they are incremental and if they are expected to be recovered. Such costs consist primarily of commission fees and sales bonuses, as well as indirect related payroll costs. Contract costs are amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight-line basis. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient which allows the Company to expense contract costs when incurred, if the amortization period is one year or less.

For further information on revenue recognition, see Note 2 below.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized in the future. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents.

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with its 2015 taxable year. As a result, the Company may deduct the distributions made to its stockholders from taxable income generated by the Company and its qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRSs"). The Company's dividends paid deduction generally eliminates the U.S. taxable income of the Company

F-15


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

and its QRSs, resulting in no U.S. income tax due. However, the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") will continue to be subject to income taxes on any taxable income generated by them. In addition, the foreign operations of the Company will continue to be subject to local income taxes regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs.

The Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. The Company's ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon its analysis and the fair market values of its REIT and non-REIT assets. For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, the Company estimates the fair market value of assets within its QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. The Company applies discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other key assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, operating margins, and forecasted capital expenditures. The Company revisits key assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

The Company grants restricted stock units to its employees and these equity awards generally have only a service condition. The Company grants restricted stock units to its executives and these awards generally have a service and performance condition or a service and market condition. To date, any performance conditions contained in an equity award are tied to the financial performance of the Company or a specific region of the Company. The Company assesses the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis. The majority of the Company's equity awards vest over

four

years, although certain of the equity awards for executives vest over a range of

two

to

four

years. The valuation of restricted stock units with only a service condition or a service and performance condition requires no significant assumptions as the fair value for these types of equity awards is based solely on the fair value of the Company's stock price on the date of grant. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value of restricted stock units with a service and market condition.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its employee stock purchase plan. The determination of the fair value of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock purchase behaviors. The Company estimated the expected volatility by using the average historical volatility of its common stock that it believed was best representative of future volatility. The risk-free interest rate used was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the equity awards. The expected dividend rate used was based on average dividend yields and the expected term used was equal to the term of each purchase window.

The accounting standard for stock-based compensation does not allow the recognition of unrealized tax benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of the compensation recorded (excess tax benefit) until the excess tax benefit is realized (i.e., reduces taxes payable). In periods prior to 2017, the Company recognized the benefit from stock-based compensation in equity when the excess tax benefit is realized by following the "with-and-without" approach. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) on January 1, 2017, the Company records the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as income tax expense through the statement of operations instead of additional paid-in capital as required under the previous guidance.

For further information on stock-based compensation, see Note 13 below.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial position of foreign subsidiaries is translated using the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, while income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are included as other comprehensive income (loss). The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in net income in the period incurred and recorded within other income (expense). Certain inter-company balances are designated as loans of a long-term investment-type nature. Accordingly, exchange gains and losses associated with these long-term inter-company balances are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), along with translation adjustments.

Earnings Per Share

The Company computes basic and diluted EPS for net income. Basic EPS is computed using net income and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using net income, adjusted for interest expense as a result of the assumed conversion of the Company's

4.75%

Convertible Subordinated Notes, if dilutive, and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus any dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares include the assumed exercise, vesting and issuance activity of employee equity awards using the treasury stock method, as well as shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the

4.75%

Convertible Subordinated Notes. See Note 4 below.

Treasury Stock

The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a higher price than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital to the extent that there are gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in capital, the losses are recorded as a component of retained earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In August 2017, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU was issued to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements and to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP. This ASU permits hedge accounting for risk components involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk, requires an entity to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the hedged item is reported, no longer requires separate measurement and reporting of hedge ineffectiveness, eases the requirement for hedge effectiveness assessment, and requires a tabular disclosure related to the effect on the income statement of fair value and cash flow hedges. This ASU is effective for annual or any interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted this standard and is finalizing its evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt this new ASU on January 1, 2019. The Company expects this ASU to impact its accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts and is currently evaluating the extent of the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, including its accounting policies, processes and systems.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02") and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's future obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use ("ROU") asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The accounting applied by a lessor is substantially unchanged under Topic 842. The standard allows entities to adopt with one of two methods: the modified retrospective transition method or the alternative transition method. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842 using the alternative transition method.

The Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease; (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (3) whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under ASC 842. The Company also

F-17


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

elected the land easements practical expedient which permits the Company not to assess at transition whether any expired or existing land easements are or contain leases if they were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840.

Upon the adoption of the new standard, the Company expects to derecognize build-to-suit assets and liabilities. Some build-to-suit leases are classified as operating leases, while some are classified as finance leases. The Company expects to recognize operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately

$1.3 billion

to

$1.6 billion

, which includes the derecognition of certain existing build-to-suit assets and liabilities subsequently assessed as operating leases. The Company is still finalizing its embedded lease assessment hence the above estimates exclude the potential impacts that might arise from the search for embedded, or previously unidentified, leases in existence as of adoption. In addition, the Company is still evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements as a lessor.

Accounting Standards Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09") and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, collectively referred as "Topic 606." Topic 606 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of control of the goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. Topic 606 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach applied to those contracts, which were not completed as of January 1, 2018, and recognized a net increase to the opening retained earnings of

$269.8 million

, net of tax impacts. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.

In adopting the new guidance, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient, which allows the company not to retrospectively restate contracts with multiple modifications on a modification by modification basis. Instead, the Company reflected the aggregate amount of all modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented using the new standard. In addition, where appropriate, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient to account for the new standard under the portfolio approach as the Company reasonably expects that the effects of applying the guidance under the portfolio approach will not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. The Company also elected to apply the practical expedient that allows the Company not to disclose the remaining performance obligations for variable consideration that is allocated to entirely unsatisfied performance obligations or to a wholly unsatisfied distinct good or service that forms part of a single obligation.

The most significant impacts to the Company from Topic 606 relate to installation revenue and costs to obtain contracts. Under the new standard, the Company recognizes installation revenue over the contract period rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. The Company is also required to capitalize and amortize certain costs to obtain contracts, rather than expense them immediately as under the previous standard.

The following table summarizes the opening and closing balances of the Company's accounts receivable, net; contract asset, current; contract asset, non-current; deferred revenue, current; and deferred revenue, non-current (in thousands):

(1)

Includes cumulative adjustments made to these accounts on January 1, 2018 from the adoption of Topic 606.

The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's accounts receivable, net, contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from the timing difference between the satisfaction of the Company's performance obligation and the customer's payment, as well as business combinations closed during the year ended

December 31, 2018

. The amounts of revenue recognized during the year ended

December 31, 2018

from the opening deferred revenue balance was approximately

$81.8 million

. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, no impairment loss related to contract balances was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.

Contract Costs

The ending balance of net capitalized contract costs as of

December 31, 2018

was

$188.2 million

, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

,

$73.1 million

of contract costs were amortized, which were included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

Remaining performance obligations

As of

December 31, 2018

, approximately

$5.8 billion

of total revenues and deferred installation revenues are expected to be recognized in future periods, the majority of which will be recognized over the next


months. While initial contract terms vary in length, substantially all contracts thereafter automatically renew in one-year increments. Included in the remaining performance obligations is either 1) remaining performance obligations under the initial contract terms or 2) remaining performance obligations related to contracts in the renewal period once the initial terms have lapsed. The remaining performance obligations do not include variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance obligations such as the usage of metered power or any contracts that could be terminated without any significant penalties such as the majority of interconnection revenues. The remaining performance obligations above exclude approximately

$1.2 billion

total revenues to be recognized in the future related to arrangements where the Company is the lessor.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

On April 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Infomart Dallas, including its operations and tenants, from ASB Real Estate Investments, for total consideration of approximately

$804.0 million

. The consideration was comprised of approximately

$45.8 million

in cash, subject to customary adjustments and

$758.2 million

aggregate fair value of

5.000%

senior unsecured notes (see Note 11). Prior to the acquisition, a portion of the building was leased to the Company and was being used as its Dallas 1, 2, 3 and 6 data centers, which were all accounted for as build-to-suit leases. Upon acquisition, the Company effectively terminated the leases and settled the related financing obligations and other liabilities related to the leases for approximately

$170.3 million

and

$1.9 million

, respectively, and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$19.5 million

. The acquisition of this highly interconnected facility and tenants adds to the Company's global platform and secures the ability to further expand in the Americas market in the future.

Both acquisitions constitute a business under the accounting standard for business combinations and, therefore, were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value on the date of acquisition.

A summary of the allocation of total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in thousands):

(1)

In connection with the Metronode Acquisition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of

$44.4 million

, which represented the seller's obligation under the purchase agreement to reimburse pre-acquisition tax liabilities settled after the acquisition.

The following table presents certain information on the acquired intangible assets (in thousands):

The fair value of customer relationships was estimated by applying an income approach, by calculating the present value of estimated future operating cash flows generated from existing customers less costs to realize the revenue. The Company applied discount rates of

7.3%

for Metronode and

8.2%

for Infomart Dallas, which reflected the nature of the assets as they relate to the risk and uncertainty of the estimated future operating cash flows. Other assumptions used to estimate the fair value of customer relationships included projected revenue growth, capital expenditures, probability of renewal, customer attrition rates and operating margins. The fair value of Infomart Dallas' trade name was estimated using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The Company applied a relief from royalty rate of

1.5%

and a discount rate of

8.2%

. The fair value of in-place leases

F-23


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

was estimated by projecting the avoided costs, such as the cost of originating the acquired in-place leases, during a typical lease up period. The fair value measurements were based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements as defined in the accounting standard for fair value measurements.

The fair value of property, plant and equipment was estimated by applying the cost approach, with the exception of land which was estimated by applying the market approach, for the Metronode Acquisition. For the Infomart Dallas Acquisition, the fair values of land, building and personal property were estimated by applying the market approach, residual income method and cost approach, respectively. The cost approach uses the replacement or reproduction cost as an indicator of fair value. The premise of the cost approach is that a market participant would pay no more for an asset than the amount for which the asset could be replaced or reproduced. The key assumptions of the cost approach include replacement cost new, physical deterioration, functional and economic obsolescence, economic useful life, remaining useful life, age and effective age. The residual income method estimates the fair value of the Infomart Dallas building using an income approach less the fair values attributed to land, personal property, in-place leases and favorable and unfavorable leases.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not completed the detailed valuation analysis of Metronode or Infomart Dallas to derive the fair value of various items including, but not limited to: property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and related tax impacts; therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on provisional estimates and is subject to continuing management analysis. As of December 31, 2018, the Company updated the preliminary allocation of purchase price for Metronode and Infomart Dallas from the provisional amounts reported as of June 30, 2018. The adjustments made primarily resulted in a decrease in property, plant and equipment, other assets, other liabilities and deferred tax assets of

$10.1 million

,

$10.0 million

,

$9.7 million

and

$4.1 million

, respectively, and an increase in goodwill, deferred tax liabilities and intangible assets of

$45.3 million

,

$35.4 million

and

$4.8 million

, respectively, for the Metronode Acquisition. The adjustments for the Infomart Dallas Acquisition primarily resulted in a decrease in goodwill of

$6.2 million

and an increase in intangible assets of

$4.6 million

. The changes in fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations for any reporting periods prior to December 31, 2018. The Company may further adjust these amounts as valuations are finalized and the Company obtains information necessary to complete the analyses, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the projected revenue increase expected to arise from future customers after the Metronode and Infomart Dallas acquisitions. Goodwill from the acquisition of Metronode is not amortizable for local tax purposes and is attributable to the Company's Asia-Pacific region. Goodwill from the acquisition of Infomart Dallas is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes and is attributable to the Company's Americas region. Operating results of Metronode and Infomart Dallas have been reported in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, respectively.

The Company incurred acquisition costs of approximately

$31.1 million

during the year ended December 31, 2018 for both acquisitions. The Company's results of operations include

$78.7 million

of revenues and an insignificant amount of net income from operations from the combined operations of Metronode and Infomart Dallas during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Certain Verizon Data Center Assets Acquisition

On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of certain colocation business from Verizon consisting of


data center buildings located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia, for a cash purchase price of approximately

$3.6 billion

. The addition of these facilities and customers adds to the Company's global platform, increases interconnections and assists with the Company's penetration of the enterprise and strategic markets, including government and energy. The Company funded the Verizon Data Center Acquisition with proceeds from debt and equity financings, which closed in January and March 2017.

In connection with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter"), dated December 6, 2016, pursuant to which a group of lenders committed to provide a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of

$2.0 billion

for the purposes of funding a portion of the cash consideration for the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. Following the completion of the debt and equity financings associated with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in March 2017, the Company terminated the Commitment Letter. The Company paid

$10.0 million

of commitment fees associated with the Commitment Letter and recorded

$2.2 million

for the year ended December 31, 2016 and

$7.8 million

for the year ended December 31, 2017 to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company included the Verizon Data Center Acquisition's results of operations from May 1, 2017 in its consolidated statements of operations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in its consolidated balance sheets beginning May 1, 2017. The Company incurred acquisition costs of approximately

$28.5 million

and

$7.6 million

during the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.

December 31, 2018

, the Company had completed the detailed valuation analysis to derive the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and updated the final allocation of purchase price from provisional amounts reported as of June 30, 2017, which primarily resulted in a decrease in intangible assets of

$9.0 million

and an increase in goodwill of

$7.7 million

Cash Flow Hedges.

The Company hedges its foreign currency translation exposure for forecasted revenues and expenses in its EMEA region between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound, Euro, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. From time to time, the foreign currency forward and option contracts that the Company uses to hedge this exposure are designated as cash flow hedges under the accounting standard for derivatives and hedging.

The Company enters into intercompany hedging instruments ("intercompany derivatives") with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in order to hedge certain forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Simultaneously, the Company enters into derivative contracts with unrelated third parties to externally hedge the net exposure created by such intercompany derivatives.

The following disclosure is prepared on a consolidated basis. Assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany derivatives have been eliminated in consolidation. As of

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

Embedded Derivatives

. The Company is deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in certain of the Company's customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or local currencies of the parties involved. These embedded derivatives are separated from their host contracts and carried on the Company's balance sheet at their fair value. The majority of these embedded derivatives arise as a result of the Company's foreign subsidiaries pricing their customer contracts in the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these embedded derivatives are included within revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The company recognized a net loss of

$6.8 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2017

. During the years ended

Economic Hedges of Embedded Derivatives.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to help manage the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or local currencies of the parties involved ("economic hedges of embedded derivatives"). Foreign currency forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues along with gains and losses of the related embedded derivatives. The Company entered into various economic hedges of embedded derivatives during the years ended

Foreign currency forward contracts.

The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, the U.S. dollar equivalent values of its foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. The Company entered into various foreign currency forward contracts during the years ended

Fair Value Measurements

Valuation Methods

Fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on methods using the market approach valuation method which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques. These techniques involve uncertainties and are affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash flows, future expected loss experience and other factors.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments.

The fair value of the Company's investments in money market funds approximates their face value. Such instruments are included in cash equivalents. The Company's money market funds and publicly traded equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. The fair value of the Company's other investments, including certificates of deposit, approximates

F-40


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

their face value. The fair value of these investments is priced based on the quoted market price for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company determines the fair values of its Level 2 investments by using inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, custody bank, third-party pricing vendors or other sources. The Company uses such pricing data as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its investment portfolio and has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs. The Company is responsible for its consolidated financial statements and underlying estimates.

The Company uses the specific identification method in computing realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses on the investments are included within other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company's investments in publicly traded equity securities are carried at fair value. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded equity securities are reported within other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded equity securities were reported in stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company recorded a net cumulative effect increase of

$2.1 million

to retained earnings.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities

. For derivatives, the Company uses forward contract and option models employing market observable inputs, such as spot currency rates and forward points with adjustments made to these values utilizing published credit default swap rates of its foreign exchange trading counterparties and other comparable companies. The Company has determined that the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, therefore the derivatives are categorized as Level 2.

(1)

Refer to Note 8 for a discussion of the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income.

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 during the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net cumulative effect adjustment of

$2.1 million

from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The realized gains and losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income as a result of sale of available for sale securities were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

(3)

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering all employees in one country where such plans are mandated by law. The Company does not have any defined benefit plans in any other countries. The unamortized gain (loss) on defined benefit plans includes gains or losses resulting from a change in the value of either the projected benefit obligation or the plan assets resulting from a change in an actuarial assumption, net of amortization.

Changes in foreign currencies can have a significant impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheets (as evidenced above in the Company's foreign currency translation loss), as well as its consolidated results of operations, as amounts in foreign currencies are generally translated into more U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar weakens or less U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar strengthens. As of

December 31, 2018

, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company operates as compared to December 31, 2017. This overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar had an overall negative impact on the Company's consolidated financial position because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars as evidenced by the increase in foreign currency translation loss for the year ended

December 31, 2018

as reflected in the above table. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which the Company does business could have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that the Company reports in future periods.

500,000

shares have been reserved for issuance under the 2004 Purchase Plan, and the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 Purchase Plan automatically increased on January 1 each year, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2014 by the lesser of

2%

of the employee's cash compensation, subject to certain share and statutory dollar limits. Two overlapping offering periods commence during each calendar year, on each February 15 and August 15 or such other periods or dates as determined by the Compensation Committee from time to time, and the offering periods last up to


months with a purchase date every

six

months. The price of each share purchased is

85%

,

35%

and

35%

, respectively, to pre-tax income as a result of the following for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

Legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, contained many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws. Among other things, the TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

effective January 1, 2018, limited the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerated expensing of certain business assets and transitioned the U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system by imposing a one-time mandatory repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. As a result of the reduced corporate tax rate, the Company recognized an income tax expense of

$6.5 million

during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a provisional estimate due to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. TRS. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company has completed the analysis of the TCJA's income tax effects and recorded an additional

$1.3 million

as an adjustment to the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. TRS.

The TCJA mandated a one-time deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, which increased the Company's 2017 taxable income, as well as its required REIT distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company estimated a provisional amount of

$195.0 million

as the one-time mandatory repatriation of its cumulative foreign earnings that was not previously included in the U.S. taxable income. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the analysis based on the interpretation and guidance issued during 2018 and determined the one-time mandatory repatriation of its cumulative foreign earnings to be

$271.8 million

. The Company had an option of including the entire amount in its 2017 taxable income or spreading the amount over 8 years in its taxable income. The Company has included the entire amount in its 2017 taxable income. The Company believes the mandatory repatriation resulted in no financial statement impact because the Company satisfied its REIT distribution requirement and paid out such amounts (net of the permitted one-time participation deduction) to its stockholders.

The TCJA included a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") provision that increases U.S. federal taxable income by certain foreign subsidiary income in the year it is earned. The Company's accounting policy is to treat any tax on GILTI inclusions as a current period cost included in the tax expense in the year incurred. The Company believes the GILTI inclusion provision will result in no financial statement impact provided the Company satisfies its REIT distribution requirement with respect to the GILTI inclusions.

As a result of the Company's conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015, it is no longer the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings. However, no deferred tax liability has been recognized to account for this change because the expected recovery of the basis difference will not result in U.S. taxes in the post-REIT conversion periods because none of its foreign subsidiaries is owned by a U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary and the withholding tax effect would be immaterial. The Company continues to assess the foreign withholding tax impact of its current policy and does not believe the distribution of its foreign

F-55


EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

earnings would trigger any significant foreign withholding taxes, as a majority of the foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates do not impose withholding taxes on dividend distributions to a corporate U.S. parent.

The types of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are set out below as of December 31 (in thousands):

The tax basis of REIT assets, excluding investments in TRSs, is greater than the amounts reported for such assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet by approximately

$1.8 billion

as of

The Company's accounting for deferred taxes involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction. After considering such evidence as the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, and the sources of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, the Company concluded that valuation allowances were required in certain foreign jurisdictions. The operations in the jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been established have a history of significant losses as of

December 31, 2018

. As such, the Company does not believe these operations have established a sustained history of profitability and that a valuation allowance is, therefore, necessary. The Company also provided a full valuation allowance against certain gross deferred tax assets acquired in the Metronode Acquisition as these deferred tax assets are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.

The unrecognized tax benefits of

$114.9 million

as of

Due to various tax years open for examination, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease over the next 12 months as the Company may be subject to either examination by tax authorities, tax audit settlements, or a lapse in statute of limitations. The Company is currently unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company's income tax returns for the years from 2015 through current remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. In addition, the Company's tax years of 2007 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination by local tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has major operations.

Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Commitments

Primarily as a result of the Company's various IBX expansion projects, as of

December 31, 2018

$0.7 billion

of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX data centers and make them available to customers for installation. In addition, the Company had numerous other, non-capital purchase commitments in place as of

EQUINIX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

million

, excluding potential lease renewals. These lease agreements will commence between February 2019 and May 2020 with lease terms of


to


years.

Contingent Liabilities

The Company estimates exposure on certain liabilities, such as indirect and property taxes, based on the best information available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, the Company records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond the Company's control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on the property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property of one of the Company's IBX data center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, the Company's property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and circumstances, the Company makes the necessary property tax accruals for each of its reporting periods. However, revisions in the Company's estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

The Company's indirect and property tax filings in various jurisdictions are subject to examination by local tax authorities. The outcome of any examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations that would affect the adequacy of its tax accruals for each of the reporting periods. If any issues arising from the tax examinations are resolved in a manner inconsistent with the Company's expectations, the revision of the estimates of the potential or actual liabilities could materially impact the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there are

no

pending claims for which the outcome is expected to result in a material adverse effect in the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Employment Agreements

The Company has entered into a severance agreement with each of its executive officers that provides for a severance payment equal to the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus in the event his or her employment is terminated for any reason other than cause or he or she voluntarily resigns under certain circumstances as described in the agreement. In addition, under the agreement, the executive officer is entitled to the payment of his or her monthly health care premiums under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act for up to 12 months. For certain executive officers, these benefits are only triggered after a change-in-control of the Company.

Indemnification and Guarantor Arrangements

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby the Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at the Company's request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits the Company's exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the Company's insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company has

no

liabilities recorded for these agreements as of

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company's business partners or customers, in connection with any U.S. patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's offerings. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. The Company has

The Company enters into arrangements with its business partners, whereby the business partner agrees to provide services as a subcontractor for the Company's installations.

The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has general and umbrella insurance policies that enable the Company to recover a portion of any amounts paid. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.

The Company has service level commitment obligations to certain of its customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in the Company's IBX data centers, whether or not within the Company's control, could result in service level commitments to these customers. The Company's liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet the Company's service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of the Company's customers and could consequently impair the Company's ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both the Company's ability to generate revenues and the Company's operating results.  The Company generally has the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized. The Company does not have significant liabilities in connection with service level credits as of

December 31, 2018

Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. The Company's revenues and results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and the Company's revenues and results of operations could fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Significant quarterly fluctuations in revenues will cause fluctuations in the Company's cash flows and the cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable accounts on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Causes of such fluctuations may include the volume and timing of new orders and renewals, the timing of the opening of new IBX data centers, the sales cycle for the Company's offerings, the introduction of new offerings, changes in prices and pricing models, trends in the internet infrastructure industry, general economic conditions, extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the occurrence of unexpected events.

The unaudited quarterly financial information presented below has been prepared by the Company and reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented.
