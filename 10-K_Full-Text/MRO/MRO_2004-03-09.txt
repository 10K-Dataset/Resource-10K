PART I

Item 1. and 2. Business and Properties

General

Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001
as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of old USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001 (the “Holding Company Reorganization”), USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated
enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction discussed in the next paragraph (the “Separation”), USX Corporation
changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

Before December
31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon’s energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”), which
was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon’s steel business. On December 31, 2001, Marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary United States Steel
Corporation (“United States Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In connection with the Separation, Marathon’s certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and, from that date, Marathon has only
one class of common stock authorized.

Marathon’s
principal operating subsidiaries are Marathon Oil Company and Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”). Marathon Oil Company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas business since 1887. MAP is 62-percent owned by Marathon
and 38-percent owned by Ashland Inc.

Marathon is engaged in
worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through MAP; and other energy related businesses.

Segment and Geographic Information

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-20.

Exploration and Production

Marathon is currently conducting exploration and development activities in nine countries. Principal exploration activities
are in the United States, Norway, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, and Canada. Principal development activities are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Russia. Marathon is also pursuing opportunities in
north and west Africa and the Middle East.

At year-end 2003,
Marathon was producing crude oil and/or natural gas in seven countries, including the United States. Marathon’s worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production, including Marathon’s proportionate share of equity investees’ production,
decreased six percent from 2002 levels. Marathon’s 2003 worldwide sales of natural gas production, including Marathon’s proportionate share of equity investees’ production and gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale,
decreased approximately five percent from 2002. In total, Marathon’s 2003 worldwide production averaged 389,000 barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) per day, including discontinued operations and impacts of acquisitions and dispositions,
compared to 412,000 BOE per day in 2002. In 2004, Marathon’s worldwide production is expected to average 365,000 BOE per day, excluding acquisitions and dispositions.

The above projection of 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and natural gas volumes is a forward-looking statement.
Some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production include pricing, supply



and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature
fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or
military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement.

United States

Including Marathon’s proportionate share of equity investee production, approximately 57 percent of Marathon’s
2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 63 percent of its worldwide natural gas production was produced from U.S. operations. Marathon’s ongoing U.S. strategy is to apply its technical expertise in fields with undeveloped potential, to
dispose of interests in non-core properties with limited upside potential and high production costs, and to acquire interests in properties with upside potential.

During 2003, Marathon drilled 21 gross (11 net) exploratory wells of which 15 gross (9 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons.
Of these 15 wells, 3 gross (2 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing.

Marathon’s principal U.S. exploration, development, and producing areas are located in the Gulf of Mexico and the states of Texas, New Mexico,
Alaska, Wyoming, and Oklahoma.

U.S. Southern Business Unit

Gulf of Mexico –

During 2003, Marathon’s share of Gulf
of Mexico production averaged 53,500 barrels per day (“bpd”) of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 48 percent of Marathon’s total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon production, and 135 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”) of natural
gas, representing 18 percent of Marathon’s total U.S. natural gas production. Liquid hydrocarbon production decreased by 9,000 net bpd and natural gas production increased by 32 net mmcfd from the prior year. The decrease in liquid hydrocarbon
production is mainly due to natural field decline. The increase in natural gas production is related to a full year of Camden Hills production in 2003 and new production from Petronius drilling, partially offset by other natural field declines. At
year-end 2003, Marathon held interests in 10 producing fields and 17 platforms, of which 7 platforms are operated by Marathon.

In 2003, Marathon announced the Neptune-5 discovery, which is located in Atwater Valley Block 574 in 6,215 feet of water. This well was drilled to a total
depth of 19,142 feet and encountered more than 500 feet of net oil pay. Although several hydrocarbon-bearing intervals are present, one interval has a gross hydrocarbon column thickness of more than 1,200 feet. Two appraisal sidetrack wells were
also drilled. The first sidetrack well, drilled down-dip from the original Neptune-5 location, encountered a similar thickness of net oil pay and penetrated an oil water contact, which extended the gross oil column by approximately 100 feet. The
second sidetrack, drilled to an up-dip location, encountered approximately 190 feet of net oil pay in several intervals. Marathon and its partners in the Neptune Unit are integrating the results of this discovery into field development studies.
Marathon holds a 30 percent interest in the Neptune Unit.

Also
announced in 2003, the Perseus discovery is located on Viosca Knoll Block 830 in 3,376 feet of water, approximately five miles from the existing Petronius platform. The well was drilled to a total depth of 13,134 feet and encountered over 130 net
feet of oil pay in the primary targets. The Perseus discovery is expected to begin production in 2004 via an extended reach well currently being drilled from the Petronius platform and extend the plateau of the Petronius production profile. Marathon
holds a 50 percent interest in the Perseus discovery and the Petronius development. Petronius is currently producing a gross average of 60,000 bpd and 100 mmcfd.

The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area for Marathon with the potential to add new reserves and increase production.
At the end of 2003, Marathon had interests in 149 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 90 in the deepwater area.

Permian Basin –

The Permian Basin region extends from southeast New Mexico to west Texas. Marathon’s share of production in this region
averaged 30,200 bpd and 132 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 32,400 bpd and 146 mmcfd in 2002. The reduction in liquid hydrocarbon and gas production was primarily due to the impact of the disposition of properties.



In June 2003, MKM Partners L.P. (“MKM”), a joint venture of Marathon and Kinder Morgan Energy
Partners L.P. (“Kinder Morgan”), sold its interest in the SACROC unit to Kinder Morgan. Also in June 2003, MKM was dissolved and its interest in the Yates field was distributed to Marathon and Kinder Morgan. In November 2003, Marathon sold
its interest in the Yates field to Kinder Morgan. These properties contributed approximately 9,000 net bpd to 2003 production.

East Texas –

Production in the East Texas gas fields averaged 73 net mmcfd in 2003 compared to 84 net mmcfd in 2002. The volume decrease was
primarily due to property dispositions totaling approximately 11 mmcfd and natural field decline.

Active development of the Mimms Creek Field continued in 2003 with Marathon drilling 22 wells. The 2003 drilling program has resulted in Mimms
Creek’s net production increasing from 9 net mmcfd to a peak of 17 net mmcfd.

U.S. Northern Business Unit

Alaska –

Marathon’s primary focus in Alaska is the expansion of its natural gas business through exploration, development and marketing. Marathon’s share of production from Alaska averaged 166 mmcfd of natural gas in
2002 and 2003.

In September 2003, Marathon began producing gas
from its Ninilchik Unit in the Cook Inlet. Production is currently flowing at a gross rate of 41 mmcfd, 21 mmcfd of which is net to Marathon, and is being transported through the recently completed Kenai Kachemak Pipeline, which connects Ninilchik
to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the Kenai Peninsula, Anchorage and other parts of south-central Alaska. Marathon operates the Ninilchik Unit and holds a 60 percent interest
in it and the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline.

Wyoming –

Liquid hydrocarbon production for 2003 averaged 21,400 net bpd compared with 22,800 net bpd in 2002. The decrease was primarily attributed to dispositions of approximately 1,000 net bpd of liquids in non-core areas of Wyoming. Average gas production
increased to 127 net mmcfd in 2003, compared to 125 net mmcfd in 2002.

In early 2001, Marathon completed the acquisition of Pennaco Energy Inc., creating a new core area of coal bed natural gas production in the Powder River Basin (“PRB”) of Wyoming. Marathon expanded its PRB assets by approximately
one-third in May 2002 as a result of the acquisition of the assets owned by its major partner in this basin. Marathon now controls more than 650,000 net acres in northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana and is the largest individual acreage holder in
the PRB. During 2003, Marathon drilled approximately 320 wells. For 2003, production rates of coal bed natural gas were 82 net mmcfd, compared to 79 net mmcfd in 2002.

Oklahoma –

Gas production for 2003 averaged 96 net mmcfd, compared with 108 net mmcfd in 2002. The decrease in
gas production was primarily due to natural field decline. In 2003, Marathon’s southern Anadarko Basin exploration efforts continued to focus on the western extension of the Cement and Marlow fields. Exploration drilling efforts resulted in
five discoveries.

International

Including Marathon’s proportionate share of equity investee production,
approximately 43 percent of Marathon’s 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 37 percent of its worldwide natural gas production was produced from international operations. During 2003, Marathon drilled 54 gross (36 net) exploratory
wells of which 47 gross (32 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 47 wells, 21 gross (14 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing.

Europe

U.K. North Sea –

Marathon’s primary asset in the U.K. North Sea is the Brae area complex where it is the operator and owns a 42 percent
interest in the South, Central, North, and West Brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities act as the host for the underlying South Brae field, adjacent Central Brae field and West Brae/Sedgwick
fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field are gas-condensate fields. These fields are produced using the gas cycling technique, whereby gas is injected into the reservoir for pressure
maintenance, improved sweep efficiency and increased condensate liquid recovery. Although partial cycling continues, the majority of North Brae gas is being transferred to the East Brae reservoir for pressure maintenance and sales.



Marathon’s share of production from the Brae area averaged 17,500 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in
2003, compared with 20,100 bpd in 2002. The decrease resulted from the natural decline in existing fields partially offset by successful development and remedial well work. Marathon’s share of Brae gas sales averaged 198 mmcfd in 2002 and 2003.
Gas sales continue to be maximized on available capacity within the pipeline system.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms and pipeline infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, there are 19 agreements with third-party fields
contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae-area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of
the facilities.

The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in
the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system. The Beryl group owns the other 50 percent. The SAGE pipeline provides transportation for Brae and Beryl area gas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1,000
mmcfd. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland provides processing for gas from the SAGE pipeline and processing for 0.8 bcfd of third party gas from the Britannia field.

During 2003, Marathon and its partners announced the startup of oil and gas production from the Marathon-operated Braemar
field in the U.K. North Sea. The field was developed with a single subsea well tied back to the East Brae platform 7.5 miles to the south where liquids and gas are processed. Marathon holds a 26 percent interest in Braemar. Production from the field
commenced in September 2003 at an initial condensate rate of 3,700 gross bpd and was increased in January 2004 to approximately 5,300 bpd. In August 2002, a 16-inch pipeline link, Linkline, between the Marathon operated Brae B platform and the
outside-operated Miller platform was sanctioned. Marathon has a 19 percent interest in the Linkline. The Linkline will initially be used for transportation of Braemar gas that has been contracted to the Miller group for operational purposes.

As part of the ongoing rationalization of the European
Business Unit, Marathon added one new block (16/1) to its inventory, and exited four blocks (22/7,22/22c,16/3d and 16/6a-S). This resulted in an overall reduction of its UK leasehold interests from 24 blocks at the start of 2003 to 21 blocks as of
December 31, 2003.

U.K. Atlantic Margin –

Marathon
has an approximately 30 percent interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex. This is made up of a 28 percent interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent of East Foinaven and 20 percent of the single well T35 and T25 accumulations.
Three successful wells were drilled in 2003. Marathon’s share of production from the Foinaven fields averaged 22,400 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 31,000 net bpd and 9 mmcfd in 2002. Lower production of liquid
hydrocarbons was due to a five-month compressor outage, completion failure in two water injection wells, and early water breakthrough in a number of main-field producers. The compressor was returned to service in November 2003 and a remedial program
is planned to address the well problems in 2004. In December 2003, production from Foinaven was averaging 25,100 net bpd and 11 net mmcfd.

Ireland –

Marathon holds a 100 percent interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale fields in the Irish Celtic Sea. Natural
gas sales were 62 net mmcfd in 2003, compared with 81 net mmcfd in 2002. The decrease in sales is primarily the result of the timing effect associated with annual storage injection versus storage withdrawals for the Kinsale storage facility, and
natural field decline.

Marathon further developed the Kinsale
Head area in 2003 by drilling and developing an additional subsea gas well. The Greensand subsea gas well is designed to enhance the productivity of the main Kinsale Head natural gas producing Greensand reservoir and has been tied back to
Marathon’s existing Kinsale Head Bravo platform. Production began in July 2003.

During 2002, an agreement was entered into with the Seven Heads group to provide gas processing and transportation services, as well as field operating services, for the Seven Heads gas being brought to the Kinsale
offshore production facilities beginning in 2003. Production from Seven Heads commenced in December 2003. Under this agreement, Marathon provides capacity to process and transport between 60 mmcfd to 100 mmcfd of Seven Heads gas.

Marathon has an 18.5 percent interest in the Corrib gas development
project, located approximately 40 miles off Ireland’s west coast. On April 30, 2003, an Irish planning authority denied the application for the proposed onshore terminal to bring ashore gas from the Corrib field. In late 2003, the project
partners submitted a new application to the planning authority. Marathon has reclassified approximately 14 million BOE from proved undeveloped reserves until the terminal application is approved, which is expected to be in late 2004.



Norway

–

In the Norwegian North Sea, Marathon’s share of production averaged
1,600 bpd and 16 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 800 bpd and 15 mmcfd in 2002. Marathon owns a 24 percent interest in the Heimdal field and gas-condensate processing center.

Marathon owns a 47 percent interest in the Vale field which is located northeast of the Heimdal field in 374 feet of water.
This single subsea well tied back to the Heimdal platform came on line in June 2002. A further exploration well was drilled on this license in 2003 and resulted in an oil discovery called the Klegg field. The Klegg well was drilled to a total depth
of 7,799 feet and encountered a gross oil column of approximately 223 feet. An evaluation of development options is underway with a decision expected in 2004.

Marathon has a 20 percent interest in the Byggve/Skirne gas-condensate field, currently in development on license PL102. This two well development is
being tied back to the Heimdal platform gas processing center, with first production expected early 2004. Condensate export will be via the Heimdal-Brae-Forties system and gas export from the Heimdal transportation center.

On April 15, 2003, Marathon announced the success of the first well of its
2003 Norwegian continental shelf exploration program on the Kneler prospect in the Alvheim area. Located approximately 140 miles from Stavanger, Norway in 390 feet of water, the Kneler exploration well was drilled to total depth of 7,425 feet and
encountered high quality crude oil in a gross oil column of 155 feet with 115 net feet of pay in the Heimdal formation. On May 27, 2003, Marathon announced a second discovery in the Alvheim area on the Boa well. The discovery well is located
approximately 4.5 miles northwest of the Kneler discovery. The Boa well was drilled into the Heimdal formation to a total depth of 7,531 feet. This well encountered an 82 foot gross gas column and a 92 foot gross oil column. Marathon and its
partners are evaluating several development scenarios for Alvheim, in which Marathon is operator and holds a 65 percent interest. Marathon expects to submit a development plan to the Norwegian authorities during the second quarter of 2004.

In December 2003, Marathon continued to grow its position
offshore Norway by acquiring interests in three additional production licenses. Marathon is operator of two of the three licenses with 100 percent working interest (PL.307 and PL.311) and 40 percent in the third (PL.304). Work obligations have been
established to promote rapid exploration of these offshore areas.

Netherlands –

Divestment of Marathon’s interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. (“CLAM”) was completed in May 2003.

West Africa

Equatorial Guinea

—During 2002, in two separate transactions, Marathon acquired interests totaling 63 percent in the Alba field. Additionally,
in these transactions, Marathon acquired a net 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant and a 45 percent net interest in an onshore methanol production plant, both held through separate equity method investees.

The large scale Alba field Phase 2 expansion, which began in
2002, made significant progress in 2003. The field development and condensate production expansion portions of the project (Phase 2A) were greater than 90% complete at year end, with completion expected around April 1

st

of 2004. Work completed in 2003 included:

•

the fabrication and installation of two new offshore platforms,

•

installation of production flowlines,

•

installation of gas re-injection lines between the offshore platforms and Marathon facilities on Bioko Island,

•

drilling and completion of five new development wells,

•

tie-back and completion of three pre-drilled wells,

•

construction of additional condensate storage tanks on Bioko Island, and

•

installation of onshore pipelines and facilities to stabilize and transfer the increased production levels.

As a result of the Phase 2A expansion, gross condensate production had grown
from 18,000 to 30,000 bpd (15,800 net) at the end of 2003. At the completion of Phase 2A, gross condensate production will be further increased to approximately 54,000 bpd (30,000 net).



The second phase of additional development (Phase 2B) includes fabrication and installation of a full
process steam LPG cryogenic gas plant and associated storage, marine terminal, and fractionation equipment for propane and heavier gas components. This addition is expected to result in additional gross condensate production of 5,000 (2,600 net)
bpd. Additionally, 20,000 (11,600 net) bpd of LPG is expected to be recovered. Phase 2B is expected to be completed near the end of 2004 raising total liquid production to a level of approximately 79,000 bpd.

On July 23, 2003, Marathon announced a natural gas discovery on Block D
offshore Equatorial Guinea, where Marathon is operator with a 90 percent interest. The discovery well is on the Bococo prospect, located in 238 feet of water, approximately six miles west of the Alba gas/condensate field. The well was drilled to a
depth of 6,110 feet and encountered 185 feet of net gas pay. The well has been suspended for reentry at a later date. The Bococo gas discovery complements three earlier dry gas discoveries on Block D for future development.

Marathon is currently evaluating the results of the recently drilled Deep
Luba prospect, which will test for potential resources under the Alba field. This well was drilled from an Alba platform, which could enable early production if successful.

Gabon

–

Marathon is operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Marin fields with a 56 percent
working interest. Production in Gabon averaged 14,700 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2003, compared with 16,700 net bpd in 2002. The decrease is attributable to the timing of liftings. Development work during 2003 brought production levels at the
Tchatamba fields up to the facility capacity of approximately 42,000 gross bpd.

Angola –

Offshore Angola, Marathon has a 10 percent working interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent working interest in Block 32. In 2002, Marathon participated in the first ultra-deepwater discovery in
Block 31. The discovery, the Plutao 1-A, was drilled to a total depth of 14,607 feet and tested 5,357 bpd through a 48/64–inch choke. In 2003, Marathon announced additional discoveries in Block 31, including the Saturno-1 and Marte-1 wells. The
Saturno-1 was drilled to a total depth of 15,444 feet and tested at a maximum rate of 5,000 bpd. The Marte-1 discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 13,756 feet and tested at a maximum rate of 5,200 bpd. Development options for Block 31 are
currently being evaluated. Also on Block 31, Marathon has participated in the Venus well, which has reached total depth. Results of the Venus well will be reported upon government approvals.

In 2003, Marathon announced the first discovery on Block 32. The Gindungo-1
well was drilled in a water depth of 4,739 feet and successively tested at rates of 7,400 and 5,700 barrels of light oil per day from two separate zones. Also on Block 32, Marathon has participated in the Canela well located approximately 8 miles
south of the Gindungo discovery on Block 32. The Canela well has reached total depth. Results of the Canela well will be reported upon government approvals.

On May 13, 2003 Marathon Oil Corporation announced that it had completed the acquisition of KMOC for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $285 million, including the assumption of $31 million in debt. KMOC currently produces approximately 16,000 net bpd in the Khanty Mansiysk region of western Siberia in the Russian Federation.

Western Canada

–

On October 1, 2003, Marathon completed
the sale of the operations in western Canada for $612 million.

Eastern Canada –

In 2002, Marathon announced a gas discovery at the Annapolis G-24 deepwater wildcat well approximately 215 miles south of Halifax, Nova Scotia in 5,504 feet of water. The G-24 encountered approximately 100 feet
of net gas pay over several zones. Marathon is operator and has a 30 percent interest in the Annapolis lease. In addition, Marathon is operator of the adjacent Empire and Cortland leases with 50 percent and 75 percent interests, respectively. During
2003, 3-D seismic was acquired over both blocks to better define the trend.

Qatar –

Marathon and three other companies are parties to a memorandum of understanding to further explore the possibility of developing a portion of the North field offshore Qatar. Marathon and its
partners are pursuing technical and commercial discussions with Qatar Petroleum that could lead to a GTL, LPG and condensate project as part of the northern field development.

Libya

–

Marathon is a member of the Oasis Group, which acquired exploration and production rights in six
concessions in the mid-1950s. Marathon has a 16.3 percent interest in these concessions. In 1986, the Oasis Group ceased active participation in the concessions following the imposition of trade sanctions by the U. S. government.



In 2002, the U. S. State Department reaffirmed the authority of the Oasis Group to hold discussions with representatives of the Libyan National Oil Company
and the Libyan government relative to the future of the concessions. Based on the U.S. Government’s recent announcement on February 26, 2004, the Oasis Group is in active discussions with the Libyan National Oil Company concerning the
negotiation of terms for their eventual return to the country.

The above discussions include forward-looking statements concerning the Phase 2A and Phase 2B expansion projects, including estimated completion dates, development plans, expected production levels, dates of initial production, which are
based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, amount of capital available for exploration and development, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates
of mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability, unforeseen problems arising from construction and other geological, operating and economic considerations. Offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the Gulf of
Mexico, the North Sea, the U.K. Atlantic Margin, the Celtic Sea, offshore Nova Scotia and offshore West Africa are also subject to severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. In addition, development of new
production properties in countries outside the United States may require protracted negotiations with host governments and is frequently subject to political considerations and tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects.
To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or negotiations and other considerations are not satisfactorily resolved, actual results could be materially different than present expectations.

Reserves

At December 31, 2003, Marathon’s net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, including its proportionate
share of equity investees’ net proved reserves, totaled approximately 1.0 billion BOE, of which 46 percent were located in the United States. (For purposes of determining BOE, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon
barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet (“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain BOE.)

Proved developed reserves represented 70 percent of total proved reserves as
of December 31, 2003, as compared to 78 percent as of December 31, 2002. The decrease primarily reflects the disposition of the Yates field. Of the just over 300 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2003, only 10 percent have been
included as proved reserves for more than two years. On a BOE basis, excluding dispositions, Marathon replaced 124 percent of its 2003 worldwide oil and gas production. Excluding acquisitions and dispositions, Marathon replaced 76 percent of
worldwide oil and gas production.



The following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each
of the last three years.

Estimated Quantities of Net Proved Oil and Gas Reserves at
December 31

(a)

Represents Marathon’s equity interests in LLC JV Chernogorskoye (“Chernogorskoye”), MKM and CLAM. MKM was dissolved and the Yates interest was sold in 2003.
Marathon’s interest in CLAM was sold in 2003.

(b)

Represents Marathon’s western Canadian assets, which were sold in 2003.

(c)

Represents Marathon’s equity interest in CLAM, which was sold in 2003.

The above estimates, which are forward-looking statements, are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known physical
data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates.

For additional details of estimated quantities of net proved
oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and
Gas Reserves” on pages F-45 through F-46. Marathon has filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) for the years 2002 and 2001 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and gas reserves. Marathon will file a similar report
for 2003. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the same as the estimates reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.



Delivery Commitments

Marathon has commitments to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of
contractual arrangements.

In Alaska, Marathon has two
long-term sales contracts with the local utility companies, which obligates Marathon to supply approximately 213 bcf of natural gas over the remaining life of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2016. In addition, Marathon has a 30 percent
ownership interest in a Kenai, Alaska, LNG plant and a proportionate share of the long-term LNG sales obligation to two Japanese utility companies. This obligation is estimated to total 138 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which
terminates March 31, 2009. These commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. Marathon’s production from various gas fields in the Cook Inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Marathon’s proved reserves and
estimated production rates in the Cook Inlet sufficiently meet these contractual obligations.

In the U.K., Marathon has two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate Marathon to supply approximately 236 bcf of natural gas through September 2009. Marathon’s Brae area production,
together with natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, will supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Marathon’s Brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates sufficiently
meet these contractual obligations. The terms of these gas sales contracts also reflect variable-pricing structures.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

RM&T operations are primarily conducted by MAP and its subsidiaries, including its wholly owned subsidiaries, Speedway
SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”) and Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC.

Refining

MAP owns and operates seven
refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 935,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of MAP’s refineries as of December 31, 2003:

In-Use Refining Capacity

MAP’s refineries
include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries have the capability to process a wide variety of crude oils and to produce typical
refinery products, including reformulated gasoline. MAP’s refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to
optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available; gas oil may be moved from Robinson to Detroit where excess fluid catalytic
cracking unit capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available.

MAP also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. MAP manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the
graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. Additionally, MAP manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax.

During 2003, MAP’s refineries processed 917,000 bpd of crude oil and 138,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. The
following table sets forth MAP’s refinery production by product group for each of the last three years:

Refined Product Yields

Planned maintenance
activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. MAP initiated major turnarounds at its Catlettsburg, Garyville, and Texas City refineries in 2003.

Technology upgrades and expansions of the fluid catalytic cracking units
(“FCCU”) at the Garyville and Texas City refineries were completed during early 2003. These projects have increased combined FCCU capacity by over 20,000 bpd, and resulted in improved yields, reduced operating costs, and enhanced
reliability of these facilities.



At its Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery, MAP has completed the approximately $440 million multi-year
integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to
improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur (TIER 2) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, MAP commenced approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd Detroit, Michigan refinery. One of the
projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air
emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan MAP the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects.

Marketing

In 2003, MAP’s refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 19.8 billion gallons (1,293,000 bpd). Excluding sales
related to matching buy/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast, and
sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of MAP’s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of MAP’s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot
market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003.

Approximately half of MAP’s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the
chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the United States. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in Canada, Mexico, India, and South America.

MAP markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals
throughout the Midwest and Southeast. The MAP customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

The following table sets forth the volume of MAP’s consolidated refined
product sales by product group for each of the last three years:

Refined Product
Sales

MAP sells reformulated
gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. MAP also sells low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states.

As of December 31, 2003, MAP supplied petroleum products to approximately
3,900 Marathon and Ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded retail outlets are also located in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama.



Retail sales of gasoline and diesel fuel were also made through company-operated outlets by SSA. As of
December 31, 2003, this subsidiary had 1,775 retail outlets in 9 states that sold petroleum products and convenience-store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names “Speedway” and “SuperAmerica.” SSA’s
revenues from the sale of convenience-store merchandise totaled $2.2 billion in 2003, compared with $2.4 billion in 2002. Profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale
of gasoline and diesel fuel. During 2003, SSA withdrew from markets in the Southeast when it sold 190 convenience stores located in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia for approximately $140 million plus store inventory.

Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”), a joint venture with Pilot
Corporation (“Pilot”), is the largest operator of travel centers in the United States with approximately 260 locations in 34 states. The travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises
brand name restaurants. On February 27, 2003, PTC purchased 60 retail travel centers from the Williams Companies located in 15 states, primarily in the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest. Pilot and MAP each own a 50 percent interest in PTC.

MAP’s retail marketing strategy is focused on SSA’s
Midwest operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand, and continued growth for PTC.

Supply and Transportation

MAP obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. In 2003, MAP’s net purchases of U.S. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 422,000 bpd, including a net
30,000 bpd from Marathon. In 2003, Canada was the source for 13 percent or 122,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 41 percent or 373,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by MAP’s refineries, including approximately
225,000 bpd from the Middle East. This crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and traders.

MAP operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. At December 31, 2003,
MAP owned, leased, or had an ownership interest in approximately 3,073 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,850 miles of product trunk lines. MAP owns a 47 percent interest in LOOP LLC (“LOOP”), which is the owner and operator of the only
U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of Louisiana; a 50 percent interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system; and a 37 percent interest in the Capline system, a large diameter crude
oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois.

MAP also has a 33 percent ownership interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, which owns a crude oil pipeline in Minnesota. Minnesota Pipe Line Company provides MAP with access to crude oil common carrier transportation from Clearbrook,
Minnesota to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in the vicinity of MAP’s St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery.

On February 10, 2003, MAP increased its ownership in Centennial Pipeline LLC from 33 percent to 50 percent and as of December 31, 2003, MAP and Texas
Eastern Products Pipeline Company, L.P. own Centennial Pipeline LLC 50 percent each. The Centennial Pipeline system connects Gulf Coast refineries with the Midwest market.

In the fourth quarter 2003, a MAP subsidiary, Ohio River Pipe Line LLC, completed the construction of the Cardinal Products
Pipeline, which extends from Kenova, West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. The first deliveries from the pipeline occurred in late December 2003. The pipeline is an interstate common carrier pipeline and is expected to initially move approximately 36,000
bpd of refined petroleum into the central Ohio region. The pipeline, which has a capacity of up to 80,000 bpd, is expected to provide a stable, cost effective supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to this market.

MAP’s 88 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located
throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. MAP’s marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined
products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. MAP also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors,
tank trailers and general service trucks.



The above RM&T discussions include forward-looking statements concerning anticipated completion of
refinery projects and the operation of the Cardinal Products Pipeline. Some factors that could potentially cause actual results for the refinery projects to differ materially from present expectations include (among others) price of petroleum
products, levels of cash flow from operations, unforeseen problems arising from construction, regulatory approval constraints and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays in construction. Some factors that could affect the pipeline
system include the price of petroleum products and other supply issues. This forward-looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ from those presently anticipated.

Other Energy Related Businesses

Marathon operates other businesses that market and transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products
manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the United States, Europe and West Africa. Some of these businesses, as well as other business projects under development, comprise Marathon’s integrated gas strategy.

Marathon owns an interest in the following pipeline systems: a
29 percent interest in Odyssey Pipeline LLC and a 28 percent interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC (both Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems); a 24 percent interest in Nautilus Pipeline Company, LLC and a 24 percent interest in Manta
Ray Offshore Gathering Company, LLC (both Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline systems); a 17 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (a light product pipeline system extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest); and a 6 percent interest
in Wolverine Pipe Line Company (a light product pipeline system extending from Chicago, IL to Toledo, OH). None of these refined product systems are part of MAP. Marathon also holds interests in some smaller offshore Gulf of Mexico oil pipeline
systems.

Marathon owns a 34 percent ownership interest in the
Neptune natural gas processing plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, which commenced operations on March 20, 2000. The plant has the capacity to process 300 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the Nautilus pipeline system, and is
being expanded to 600 mmcfd capacity effective early 2004.

In
addition to the sale of its own oil and natural gas production, Marathon purchases oil and gas from third party producers and marketers for resale.

Marathon owns a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to
customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of Marathon’s natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, the LNG has been sold under a long-term contract with two of Japan’s largest
utility companies. Marathon has a 30 percent participation in this contract, which will continue through March 31, 2009. LNG deliveries totaled 66 gross bcf (22 net bcf) in 2003.

On January 3, 2002, Marathon acquired a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea from
CMS Energy. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of Marathon’s natural gas production in the Alba field. Methanol production totaled 836,000 gross metric tons (376,000 net metric tons) in 2003. Production from the plant is used to
supply customers in Europe and the U.S.

In August 2002,
Marathon acquired the rights to deliver up to 58 bcf of LNG annually to the Elba Island LNG terminal near Savannah, Georgia. The contract has a 17-year term with an option to extend for an additional five-year period. The agreement provides for the
right to deliver LNG under a put option with the capacity owner of the facility and, under certain conditions, take redelivery of natural gas for onward sale to third parties.

Marathon’s Atlantic Basin integrated gas activity centers around the monetization of Marathon’s gas reserves from
the Alba field. This proposed project would involve construction of a 3.4 million metric tonnes per year LNG facility located on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, with startup currently projected for late 2007. In the second quarter of 2003,
Marathon, the Government of Equatorial Guinea, and GEPetrol, the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea, signed a heads of agreement on fiscal terms and conditions for the development of the LNG facility. In addition, Marathon signed a letter of
understanding with BG Gas Marketing, Ltd. (“BGML”), a subsidiary of BG Group plc, under which BGML would purchase the LNG plant’s production for a period of 17 years. BGML has stated its intent to deliver the LNG primarily to the
LNG receiving terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline grid. The provisions of the letter of understanding are subject to a definitive purchase and sale agreement, which
the parties expect to finalize in the second quarter of 2004.



In the Pacific Basin, one of the integrated gas projects Marathon has been pursuing, the Tijuana Regional
Energy Center, will not proceed. Marathon has been unable to make significant progress on this project, principally due to the lack of local and regional support that would be necessary to obtain land use and other key permits. More recently, the
Baja California State Government announced plans to expropriate land, on which Marathon and its partners held options to purchase, that would have been the site for the proposed project.

Marathon has been engaged in GTL research and development since the early 1990s with the goal of creating a process and
facility capable of converting natural gas into ultra-clean diesel fuel. Currently, Marathon is participating in a GTL demonstration plant at the Port of Catoosa near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Dedicated during the fourth quarter of 2003, this complex is part
of the Department of Energy’s Ultra-Clean Fuels Program. This GTL technology development is being pursued in conjunction with Marathon’s proposed Qatar GTL project.

In the first quarter of 2004, Marathon will realign its segment reporting. A new segment, Integrated Gas, will be introduced
and the Other Energy Related Businesses (“OERB”) segment will be eliminated. Of the business activities discussed above, the Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, crude oil marketing activities and the Catoosa demonstration plant will
be reported in the Exploration and Production segment. The refined products pipeline systems will be reported in the Refining, Marketing and Transportation segment. The remaining activities will comprise the Integrated Gas segment which will consist
of LNG facilities, certain midstream gas plants and pipelines, non-equity natural gas marketing activity, and continued execution of other integrated gas strategies in the Atlantic and Pacific Basins, which may or may not be connected to
Marathon’s E&P activity. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook” on page 47.

The above OERB discussion contains forward looking statements concerning the
plans for a LNG facility and a LNG offtake transaction. Factors that could affect the plans for the LNG plant and LNG offtake transaction include the successful negotiation and execution of definitive purchase and sale agreements for gas supply and
LNG offtake, board approval of the transactions, approval of the LNG project by the Government of Equatorial Guinea, unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary
government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather
conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. Marathon
competes with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural
gas to end-users. Many of Marathon’s competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to Marathon. As a consequence, Marathon may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas.
Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. Marathon also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists,
geophysicists and other specialists. Based on industry sources, Marathon believes it currently ranks eighth among U.S.-based petroleum corporations on the basis of 2002 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.

Marathon through MAP must also compete with a large number of other companies
to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. MAP believes it ranks fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of January 1, 2004.
MAP competes in four distinct markets – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution—for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand
marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 80 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; 11 refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 275
petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. Marathon competes in the convenience store industry through SSA’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad
mix of other merchandise and services. Some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as Subway

™

. Marathon also competes in the travel center industry through its 50 percent ownership in PTC.



Marathon’s operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets it serves. Generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by
crude oil price increases. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.

The Separation

On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001 (“Reorganization Agreement”), Marathon
completed the Separation, in which:

•

its wholly owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and

•

USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

As a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. Thomas J.
Usher is chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of December 31, 2003, four of the ten remaining members of Marathon’s board of directors are also directors of United States Steel.

In connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization,
Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the
Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements.

Financial Matters Agreement

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all Marathon’s principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts
due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by Marathon:

•

obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033;

•

sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to
extensions;

•

obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel; and

•

certain other guarantees.

The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for
Marathon’s discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying Marathon an amount equal to the
remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in
the period extending through December 31, 2009.

Under the
financial matters agreement, United States Steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or
release of security interests. United States Steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of Marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of
the assumed lease obligations.

The financial matters agreement
also requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee Marathon provided with respect to all United States Steel’s obligations under a partnership agreement
between United States Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit Corporation of Delaware and Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it
is required to fund



accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has
indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures.

The financial matters agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to
the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. The agreement also obligates Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of
credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations.

United States Steel’s obligations to Marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured
obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our
consent.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Marathon and United States Steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies
to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. Provisions of this agreement include the following:

•

for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before December 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between Marathon and United States Steel
generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation;

•

no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after December 31, 2001; and

•

provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the Separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-Separation
activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation.

Under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation:

•

the taxes payable by each of the Marathon Group and the U.S. Steel Group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and

•

the U.S. Steel Group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses
and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable.

In accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the Separation, Marathon made a preliminary settlement with United States Steel of
approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended December 31, 2001 under the pre-Separation tax sharing principles.

The tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable
periods, ended before December 31, 2001.

In the tax sharing
agreement, each of Marathon and United States Steel promised the other party that it:

•

would not, before January 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, jeopardize the
tax-free status of the Separation; and

•

would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the
Separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction.

The prescribed actions and transactions include:

•

the liquidation of Marathon or United States Steel; and

•

the sale by Marathon or United States Steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business.



In case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement
has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability.

Even if the Separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Separation may become taxable to
Marathon under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either Marathon or United States Steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related
transactions that include the Separation. For this purpose, a “50 percent or greater interest” means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least
50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. To minimize this risk, both Marathon and United States Steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their
equity structures that could cause the Separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code may apply. If an acquisition occurs that results in the
Separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction.

Although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Separation, each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the Separation, is
jointly and severally liable under the Internal Revenue Code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. To address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of
a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to
obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. Marathon can provide no assurance, however, that United States Steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any,
to Marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement.

Obligations
Associated with the Separation as of December 31, 2003

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel” on page 43 for a discussion of Marathon’s obligations
associated with the Separation.

Environmental Matters

Marathon maintains a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Marathon’s Board of Directors. Marathon’s Health, Environment and Safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that Marathon’s operating organizations maintain environmental
compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Health, Environment and Safety Management Committee, which is comprised of officers of Marathon, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various
environmental compliance programs. Marathon also has an Emergency Management Team, composed of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving Marathon or any of its properties.

Marathon’s businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and
remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where Marathon operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters. These laws and
their associated regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and
impose liability on Marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for Marathon’s acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and
regulations is not always clearly known or determinable, due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws
and regulations, particularly the 1990



Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital,
operating and compliance costs.

For a discussion of
environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies” on page 45 and “Legal
Proceedings” on page 24.

Air

Of particular significance to MAP are EPA regulations that require reduced
sulfur levels in the manufacture of gasoline and on-road diesel fuel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Marathon estimates that MAP’s combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules could amount to approximately $900
million, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects, between 2002 and 2006. Some factors that could potentially affect MAP’s gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary
construction and environmental permits, completion of project detailed engineering, and project construction and logistical considerations.

The U.S. EPA has finalized new and revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate emissions (PM2.5) and ozone. In
connection with these new standards, EPA will designate certain areas as “nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such areas do not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas EPA has proposed a rule called the Interstate
Air Quality Rule (“IAQR”) that will require significant reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions in numerous states. All of Marathon’s refinery operations are located within these affected states. If this rule is finalized, it could have a
significant impact on Marathon’s operations as well as the operations of many of Marathon’s competitors. At this time, Marathon cannot determine whether the IAQR will be finalized or whether it will be substantially changed before it is
final. As a result, Marathon cannot presently reasonably estimate the financial impact of such a rule.

Water

Marathon
maintains numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and has implemented systems to oversee its compliance efforts. In addition, Marathon is regulated under OPA-90, which
amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of such releases OPA-90 requires
responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions.

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not
double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. As of December 31, 2003, all of the barges used in MAP’s river transportation operations meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90.

Marathon operates facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances
could occur. Several coastal states in which Marathon operates have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.
Marathon has implemented emergency oil response plans for all of its components and facilities covered by OPA-90.

Solid Waste

Marathon continues to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in its operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of
solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks
(“USTs”) containing regulated substances. Since the EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of RCRA and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing regulations it has
promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. In addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of
compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined.



Remediation

Marathon owns or operates certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have occurred.
Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer
their own UST programs. Marathon’s obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which it operates. A portion of these remediation
costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. Accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been
determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable.

As a general rule, Marathon and Ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to MAP. Such continuing responsibility, in
certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time.

Properties

The location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of Marathon have been described previously. Except for
oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. The plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. At
the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. The properties classified as owned in fee generally have
been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim.

The basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated
Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves” on pages F-45 through F-46.

Property,
Plant and Equipment Additions

For property, plant and
equipment additions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity – Capital Expenditures” on page 40.

Employees

Marathon had 27,007 active employees as of December 31, 2003, including 23,556 MAP employees. Of the total number of MAP employees, 17,139 were employees
of Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, most of whom were employees at retail marketing outlets.

Certain hourly employees at the Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31,
2006. The same union represents certain hourly employees at the Texas City refinery under a labor agreement that expires on March 31, 2006. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees at the St. Paul Park and
Detroit refineries under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2006 and January 31, 2007, respectively.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters
are included below in this discussion. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is
possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

Natural Gas Royalty
Litigation

Marathon was served in two qui tam cases,
which allege that federal and Indian lessees violated the False Claims Act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. The first case,

U.S. ex rel Jack J. Grynberg v. Alaska Pipeline Co., et
al.

is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case,

U.S. ex rel Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al,

is primarily a gas valuation case. These cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that
penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. The Department of Justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would
not intervene against certain other defendants including Marathon. The matters are in the discovery phase and Marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases.

Powder River Basin Arbitration

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) completed a multi-year review of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on
federal lands in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. The Agency’s Record of Decision (“ROD”) was signed on April 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. Plaintiff environmental and other groups filed
four suits in May 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana against the BLM alleging the Agency’s environmental impact review was not adequate. Plaintiffs seek a court order enjoining coal bed methane development on federal
lands in the Powder River Basin until BLM conducts additional studies on the environmental impact. Marathon has been allowed to intervene as a party in all four of the cases. As the lawsuits to delay energy development in the Powder River Basin
progress through the courts, BLM continues to process permits to drill under the ROD. In January 2004, the Court over protests of Plaintiffs, transferred to the District Court of Wyoming, portions of two of the cases dealing with the sufficiency of
the environmental impact review as to lands in Wyoming.

Environmental Proceedings

The following is a summary of proceedings involving
Marathon that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2003, under federal and state environmental laws. Except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management’s
belief set forth in the first paragraph under Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” above takes such matters into account.

Claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) for each site include present and
former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any
particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be
incurred, Marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA.

Projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of
environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements.

At December 31, 2003, Marathon had been identified as a PRP at a total of 9 CERCLA waste sites. Based on currently available information, which is in many
cases preliminary and incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. Marathon believes that its
liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million.



In addition, there are four sites where Marathon has received information requests or other indications
that it may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability.

There are also 125 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental
statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 16 were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland which has retained liability for all costs associated
with remediation. Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 15 of these sites will be under $100,000 per
site, 43 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 16 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site, 7 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site, and one
additional site has the potential to exceed $5 million. There are 27 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs.

There is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality at a closed and dismantled
refinery site located near Muskegon, Michigan. During the next 10 to 20 years, Marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. Expenditures in 2003 were approximately $225,000, and expenditures in 2004 will be approximately
$500,000. Ongoing work at this site is subject to approval by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”), and a risk-based closure strategy is being developed and will be approved by the MDEQ.

MAP has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office since 2002 concerning MAP’s self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MAP has had
periodic discussions with Illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions are anticipated in 2004.

The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Cabinet issued the MAP Catlettsburg, Kentucky Refinery a Notice of Violation (“NOV”) regarding
the Tank 845 rupture which occurred in November of 1999. The tank rupture caused the tank’s contents to be released onto the ground and adjoining retention area. MAP resolved this matter in 2003 for a civil penalty of $120,000 and the entering
of an agreed Administrative Order.

In 2000, the Kentucky
Natural Resources and Environmental Cabinet sent Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC a NOV seeking a civil penalty associated with a pipeline spill earlier that year in Winchester, Kentucky. MAP has settled this NOV in the form of an Agreed-to
Administrative Order which was finalized and entered in January 2002 and required payment of a $170,000 penalty and reimbursement of past response costs up to $131,000.

In July, 2002, Marathon received a Notice of Enforcement from the State of Texas for alleged excess air emissions from its
Yates Gas Plant and production operations on its Kloh lease. The Notices did not compute a penalty or fine for these pending enforcement actions; a tentative settlement for under $200,000 in civil penalties and a Supplemental Environmental Project
has been reached and awaits full Commission approval.

In May,
2003, Marathon received a Consolidated Compliance Order & Notice or Potential Penalty from the State of Louisiana for alleged various air permit regulatory violations. This matter has been resolved in principle with the State for a civil penalty
of under $150,000 and awaits formal closure with the State.

During the third quarter of 2003, a MAP subsidiary, Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), entered into Director’s Final Findings and Orders with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”). The OEPA had alleged
ORPL violations of a stormwater permit and pollution prevention plan during construction of the Cardinal Products Pipeline. The Findings and Orders required compliance with the permit, plan and other requirements, and payment of a $104,738 civil
penalty.



Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Not applicable.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

The principal market on which the Company’s common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange. Information concerning the high and low sales
prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in “Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)” on page F-41.

As of January 31, 2004, there were 61,404 registered holders
of Marathon common stock.

The Board of Directors intends to
declare and pay dividends on Marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of Marathon Oil Corporation, although it has no obligation under Delaware law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to do so. In
determining its dividend policy with respect to Marathon common stock, the Board will rely on the financial statements of Marathon. Dividends on Marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of Marathon.

On January 29, 2003, Marathon amended the Rights Agreement, dated as
September 28, 1999, as amended, between Marathon and National City Bank, as successor rights agent. The Rights Agreement was amended so that the Rights to Purchase Series A Junior Preferred Stock expired on January 31, 2003, more than six years
earlier than initially specified in the plan.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

See page F-49 through F-51.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon”) is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining,
marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its 62 percent owned subsidiary, Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”); and other energy related businesses. The Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of Marathon. These statements typically contain words such as “anticipates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “expects,” “targets”, “plan,” “project,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would” or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In
accordance with “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could
cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Unless specifically noted, amounts for MAP do not reflect any reduction for the 38 percent interest held by Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”).

Overview

Marathon’s overall operating results depend on the profitability of its exploration and production
(“E&P”) and refining, marketing and transportation (“RM&T”) segments.

Exploration and Production

E&P segment revenues correlate closely with prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. The increase in Marathon’s E&P segment revenues during 2003 tracked the increase in prices for these
commodities. The robust prices for crude oil during 2003 were caused in part by increased demand in strengthening economies, particularly in the United States and the Far East, reduced crude oil inventories, as well as civil and political unrest and
military actions in various oil exporting countries. The average spot price during 2003 for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark crude oil, was $31.06 per barrel – up from an average of $26.16 in 2002 – and ended the year at $32.47.

Natural gas prices were significantly higher in 2003 as
compared to 2002. A significant portion of Marathon’s United States lower 48 natural gas production is sold at bid week prices, making this indicator particularly important. The average quarterly bid week prices for 2003 were $6.58, $5.40,
$4.97 and $4.58, respectively for the first to fourth quarter. Natural gas prices in Alaska are largely contractual, while natural gas production there is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during
the fourth and first quarters. The other major gas-producing region for Marathon is Europe, where a large portion of Marathon’s gas sales are at contractual prices, making them less subject to European price volatility.

For additional information on price risk management, see “Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” on page 52.

E&P segment income during 2003 was impacted by slightly lower oil-equivalent production – down approximately 6 percent from 2002 levels. 2004 production is expected to decrease about 6 percent from 2003
levels mainly due to sales of non-core properties during 2003. Marathon estimates its 2004 production will average approximately 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions or
dispositions. While production is expected to remain relatively flat through 2005, significant production growth is expected starting in 2006 from known projects in new core areas and recent exploration successes. Total production is anticipated to
grow by more than 3 percent on an average annual basis between 2003 and 2008.

Projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and demand, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production
decline rates for mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and geological and operating considerations. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been driven
by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world’s major oil and gas producing areas, including OPEC member



countries. Any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on Marathon’s results of operations. A decline in such prices
could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development.

E&P operations are subject to various hazards, including acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military
response thereto, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. Offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, the U.K. Atlantic Margin, the Celtic Sea, offshore Nova Scotia and offshore
West Africa are also subject to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. Development of new production properties in countries outside the United States may require protracted negotiations with host
governments and are frequently subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

MAP refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States.
RM&T segment income primarily reflects MAP’s income from operations which depends largely on the refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the
profitability of its pipeline transportation operations.

The
refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of purchased products and manufacturing costs. MAP is a purchaser of
crude oil in order to satisfy throughput requirements of its refineries. As a result, its refining and wholesale marketing margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace.
The crack spread, which is a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. In addition to changes in the crack spread, MAP’s refining and
wholesale marketing margin is impacted by the types of crude oil processed, the wholesale selling prices realized for all the products sold and the level of manufacturing costs. MAP processes significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances its
competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. As crude oil production increases in the coming years, heavy, sour crude oil production growth is expected to outpace sweet crude oil
production growth , which may translate into higher sour crude oil discounts going forward. Over the last three years, approximately 60% of the crude oil throughput at MAP’s refineries has been sour crude oil. Sales of asphalt increase during
the highway construction season in MAP’s market area which is primarily in the second and third calendar quarters. The selling price of asphalt is dependant on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of
construction activity in both the private and public sectors. Changes in manufacturing costs from period to period are primarily dependant on the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas. The refining
and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products and raw
materials.

For additional information on price risk
management, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” on page 52.

Additionally, the retail marketing gasoline and distillate margin, the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the wholesale cost of
the refined products, including secondary transportation, plays an important part in downstream profitability. Retail gasoline and distillate margins have been historically volatile, but tend to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale
marketing margin. Factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact
driving conditions. Gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer
demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in the marketing areas. The profitability of MAP’s pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependant on the volumes shipped through the
pipelines. The volume of crude oil that MAP transports is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by MAP’s crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the
production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative transportation modes, and the refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The throughput of the refined products that MAP transports is directly
affected by the production level of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by MAP’s refined product pipelines. In most of MAP’s markets, demand for gasoline peaks during



the summer driving season, which extends from May through September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The seasonal pattern for distillates is
the reverse of this, helping to level overall movements on an annual basis. As with crude, other transportation alternatives and maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

Environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed (and are expected to continue
to impose) increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations that may have an adverse effect on margins and financial condition. Refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business
interruptions due to unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. They are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage
or loss from severe weather conditions.

Marathon operates other businesses that market and
transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, primarily in the United States, Europe and West Africa. The profitability of these
operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. Methanol spot pricing is very volatile largely because global methanol demand is only 30 millions tons and any one major unplanned shutdown or new
addition can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. Other energy related businesses (“OERB”) operations could be impacted by unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, product spills, inclement weather or availability of
LNG vessels. They are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ
from the estimates and assumptions used.

Certain accounting
estimates are considered to be critical if a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change;
and b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.

Estimated Net Recoverable Quantities of Oil and Gas

Marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon
the estimation of proved reserves, both developed and undeveloped. The existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether or not certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs
depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties and the expected future taxable income
available to realize the value of deferred tax assets, which are discussed further below, rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas.

Marathon’s estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by
in-house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. During 2003, approximately 35 percent of Marathon’s total proved reserves were prepared, reviewed or validated by third-party petroleum engineering consultants. The results of these
third-party reviews were consistent with Marathon’s proved reserve estimates.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are subject to change, either positively and negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. During 2003, net revisions of
previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 40 million BOE as a result of 97 million BOE in positive revisions which were partially offset by 57 million BOE in negative revisions.



Proved developed reserves represented 70 percent of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2003, as
compared to 78 percent as of December 31, 2002. The decrease primarily reflects the disposition of the Yates field. Of the just over 300 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2003, only 10 percent have been included as proved reserves for
more than two years.

Costs incurred for the periods ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, including Marathon’s proportionate share of equity investees’ costs incurred, were $780 million, $404 million, and $365 million. As
of December 31, 2003, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2004 through 2006 are projected to be $324 million, $149 million, and $126 million.

Expected Future Cash Flows Generated by Certain Oil and Gas Producing Properties

Marathon must estimate the expected future cash flows
to be generated by its oil and gas producing properties to evaluate the possible need to impair the carrying value of those properties. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which
independent cash flows can be identified, which is called an “asset group”. An impairment of any one of Marathon’s five largest producing property asset groups could have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition,
changes in financial condition or results of operations. Those asset groups – the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea, the coal bed natural gas properties of the Powder River Basin, the Brae Area Complex offshore the United Kingdom, Petronius
development in the Gulf of Mexico, and Potanay field in the Russian Federation – comprise approximately 49 percent of Marathon’s total proved oil and gas reserves. The expected future cash flows from these asset groups require
assumptions about matters such as the prevailing level of future oil and gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country.

Long-lived asset groups held and used in operations must be impaired when the
carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value. Recoverability of the carrying values is determined by comparison with the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by those groups. As of December 31, 2003, no impairment
in the value of the Alba field, Powder River Basin, Brae Area Complex, Petronius development or the Potanay field was indicated.

Expected Future Taxable Income

Marathon must estimate its expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of its deferred income tax assets. As of December 31, 2003, Marathon
reported net deferred tax assets of $1.155 billion, which represented gross assets of $1.731 billion net of valuation allowances of $576 million.

Numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events,
such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and future financial conditions. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in Marathon’s
internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans.

In
determining its overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, Marathon considers proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to its existing producing properties,
as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in the judgment of Marathon management, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. In assessing the propriety of releasing an
existing valuation allowance, Marathon considers the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset.

Additionally, Marathon must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities
recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually
occurred. The principal tax planning strategy available to Marathon relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are
reconsidered annually to give effect to changes in Marathon’s portfolio of producing properties and in its tax profile.

Marathon’s deferred tax assets include $450 million relating to Norwegian net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). Marathon has
established a valuation allowance of $420 million against these NOLs. Currently, Marathon generates income from the Heimdal and Vale fields in the Norwegian North Sea. Marathon acquired



additional interests in Norway in each of the last three years. These interests currently have no proved reserves and generate no income, although some
interests hold undeveloped discoveries. To the extent that these interests demonstrate the capability to generate future taxable income, Marathon may be able to release some or all of its $420 million valuation allowance in future periods.

Net Realizable Value of Receivables from United States Steel

As described further in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel” on page 43, Marathon remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other
financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the Separation. As of December 31, 2003, Marathon has reported receivables from United States Steel of $613 million, representing the
amount of principal and accrued interest on Marathon debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment. Marathon must assess the realizability of these receivables, based on its expectations of United States Steel’s
ability to satisfy its obligations. To make this assessment, Marathon must rely on public information about United States Steel. As of December 31, 2003, Marathon has judged the entire receivable to be realizable.

Marathon may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by United
States Steel on a significant portion of this receivable until December 31, 2011. Of the $613 million, $469 million, or 77 percent, relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in 2011 or later. The Financial Matters Agreement between Marathon
and United States Steel provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, which is December 31, 2011, United States Steel will provide for Marathon’s discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial
revenue bonds.

As of December 31, 2003, Marathon’s
cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (which includes debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment) was 33 percent. The assessment of Marathon’s liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations
concerning United States Steel’s ability to satisfy its obligations.

If the debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation, Marathon’s cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, 2003 would have been
approximately 28 percent. On the other hand, if the receivable from United States Steel had been written off as unrealizable, the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, 2003 would have been approximately 34 percent. (If United
States Steel were unable to satisfy its obligations, other adjustments in addition to the write-off of the receivable may be necessary.)

Net Realizable Value of Inventories

Generally accepted accounting principles require that inventories be carried at lower of cost or market. Accordingly, when the cost basis of
Marathon’s inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products exceed market value, Marathon establishes an inventory market valuation (“IMV”) reserve to reduce the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable value.
Adjustments to the IMV reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations.

When Marathon Oil Company was acquired in March 1982, prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were at historically high levels. In applying the purchase method of accounting, inventories of liquid
hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were revalued by reference to current prices at the time of acquisition. This became the new LIFO cost basis of the inventories.

When Marathon acquired the crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories associated with Ashland’s RM&T
operations on January 1, 1998, Marathon established a new LIFO cost basis for those inventories. The acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the overall average cost of the combined RM&T inventories. As a result, the price threshold at
which an IMV reserve will be recorded was also lowered.

Since
the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products do not correlate perfectly, there is no absolute price threshold below which an IMV adjustment will be recognized. However, generally, Marathon will establish an IMV reserve when crude
oil prices fall below $20 per barrel. As of December 31, 2003, with the WTI spotprice at $32.47 per barrel, no IMV reserve was needed.



Contingent Liabilities

Marathon accrues contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability
claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. Marathon’s in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. For additional
information on contingent liabilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies” on page 45.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Accounting for these benefit obligations involves assumptions related to:

•

discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations

•

expected long-term rates of return on plan assets

•

rate of future increases in compensation levels

•

health care cost projections

Marathon develops its demographics and utilizes the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. In determining the
discount rate, Marathon reviews market yields on high-quality corporate debt. The asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans, targeted at 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities, past performance and other factors.
Compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. Marathon reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends in establishing health care cost trend rates.

Of the assumptions used to measure the December 31, 2003 obligations and
estimated 2004 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. A .25% basis point decrease in the discount rate of 6.25% for domestic and 5.40% for international
would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately $12 million and $3 million, respectively.

Estimated Fair Value of Asset Retirement Obligations

The fair value of an asset retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made. For Marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities. Asset retirement obligations include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of production platforms, gathering systems,
wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. Estimates of these costs are developed for each property based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market
demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires
management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including future retirement costs, future recoverable quantities of oil and gas, future inflation rates, the credit-adjusted risk-free
interest rate, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.

Marathon’s estimation of asset retirement obligations and retirement dates is primarily performed by in-house engineers in consultation with in-house legal and environmental experts. Due to the inherent
uncertainties in asset retirement obligations and retirement dates, these estimates are subject to potentially substantial changes, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, legal,
environmental, economic and technological conditions change.

While assets such as refineries, crude oil and product pipelines, and marketing assets have asset retirement obligations, certain of those obligations are not recognized since the fair value cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the
settlement date of the obligation.

Marathon’s estimates
of the ultimate asset retirement obligations are based on estimates in current dollars, inflated to the estimated date of retirement by an annual inflation factor. Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects of a hypothetical 1% increase in the
inflation rate would have resulted in an approximately $28 million increase in the fair value of the asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2003, and an approximately $5 million decrease in 2003 income from operations.



Estimated Fair Value of Non-Exchange Traded Derivative Contracts

Marathon fairly values all derivative instruments. Derivative instruments
are used to manage risk throughout Marathon’s different businesses. These risks relate to commodities, interest rates and to a lesser extent our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Marathon uses derivative instruments that are exchange
traded and non-exchange traded. Non-exchange traded instruments are referred to as over-the-counter (“OTC”) instruments.

The fair value of exchange traded instruments is based on existing market quotes derived from major exchanges such as the New York Merchantile Exchange.
The fair value for OTC instruments such as options and swap agreements is developed through the use of option-pricing models or third party market quotes. The option-pricing models incorporate assumptions related to market volatility, current market
price, strike price, interest rates and time value. Marathon utilizes purchased software option-pricing tools, similar to the Black-Scholes model, to fairly value its options related to commodity-based risks. OTC swap agreements are used to manage
our exposure to interest rates. Marathon obtains third party dealer quotes to mark-to-market these financial instruments. In addition, Marathon has developed an internal pricing model which takes into consideration the specific contract terms and
the forward market for interest rates. This tool is used to test the reasonableness of the third party dealer quotes associated with the OTC swap agreements.

Marathon also fairly values two natural gas long term delivery commitment contracts in the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments
and recognizes the change in fair value of those contracts on a quarterly basis within income from operations. The fair value is derived from published market data such as the Heren Report that captures the market-based natural gas activity in the
United Kingdom. Currently, an 18 month forward pricing curve is utilized as this represents approximately 90% of the market liquidity in that region.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Income and Operations

Revenues

for each of the last three years are summarized in the
following table:

E&P segment
revenues increased by $279 million in 2003 from 2002 and decreased by $534 million in 2002 from 2001. The 2003 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices. This increase was partially offset by lower
liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower worldwide natural gas prices and lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes, partially offset by higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices. Derivative
gains (losses) totaled $(176) million in 2003, compared to $52 million in 2002 and $85 million in 2001. Derivatives included losses of $66 million in 2003, compared to gains of $18 million in 2002, related to long-term gas contracts in the United
Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market.

RM&T segment revenues increased by $8.115 billion in 2003 from 2002 and decreased by $848 million in 2002 from 2001. The 2003 increase primarily reflected higher refined product selling prices and volumes and
increased matching crude oil buy/sell transaction volumes and prices. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower refined product prices.

OERB segment revenues increased by $1.087 billion in 2003 from 2002 and $60 million in 2002 from 2001. The increase in 2003 is a result of higher natural
gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and increased natural gas and crude oil marketing activity. The increase in 2002 reflected a favorable effect from increased natural gas and crude oil marketing activity partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
Derivative gains (losses) totaled $19 million in 2003, compared to $(8) million in 2002 and $(29) million in 2001.

For additional information on segment results, see discussion on income from operations on page 36.

Income from equity method investments

decreased by $108 million in
2003 and increased by $19 million in 2002 from 2001. The decrease in 2003 is due to a $124 million loss on the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P., partially offset by increased earnings of other equity method investments due to higher natural gas and
liquid hydrocarbons prices. For further discussion of the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P., see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in 2002 is primarily the result of increased earnings in other equity method investments
due to higher liquid hydrocarbons prices.

Net gains on
disposal of assets

increased by $99 million in 2003 from 2002 and $23 million in 2002 from 2001. During 2003, Marathon sold its interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V., interests in several pipeline companies, Yates field and gathering system, SSA
stores primarily in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, and certain fields in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. Results from 2002 include the sale of various SSA stores and the sale of San Juan Basin assets. Results from 2001 include
the sale of various SSA stores and various domestic producing properties.

Gain (loss) on ownership change in MAP

reflects the effects of contributions to MAP of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by Marathon and Ashland. In accordance
with MAP’s limited liability company agreement, in certain instances, environmental capital



expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of the assets, but no change in ownership interest may result from
these contributions. An excess of Ashland funded improvements over Marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of Marathon funded improvements over Ashland funded improvements results in a net loss.

Cost of revenues

increased by $8.718 billion in 2003 from 2002 and
$367 million in 2002 from 2001. The increases in the OERB segment were primarily a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon costs. The increases in the RM&T segment primarily reflected higher acquisition costs for crude oil, refined
products, refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased by $107 million in 2003 from 2002 and $125 million in 2002 from 2001. The increase in 2003 was primarily a result of increased employee benefits (caused by
increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets) and other employee related costs. Also, Marathon changed assumptions in the health care cost trend rate from 7.5% to 10%,
resulting in higher retiree health care costs. Additionally, during 2003, Marathon recorded a charge of $24 million related to organizational and business process changes. The increase in 2002 primarily reflected increased employee related costs.

Inventory market valuation reserve

is established to
reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value. The 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $71 million, reversing the IMV reserve at December 31, 2001. For additional information on this adjustment, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Critical Accounting Estimates – Net Realizable Value of Inventories” on page 31.

Net interest and other financial costs

decreased by $82 million in 2003 from 2002, following an increase of $96 million in 2002 from 2001. The
decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects, the favorable effect of interest rate swaps, the favorable effect of interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest
income on investments. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher average debt levels resulting from acquisitions and the Separation. Additionally, included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $13 million
and $8 million for 2003 and 2002 and losses of $5 million for 2001.

Loss from early extinguishment of debt

in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt, resulting in a loss of $53 million. As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 145 “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS No. 145”), the loss from early extinguishment of debt that was previously
reported as an extraordinary item (net of taxes of $20 million) has been reclassified into income before income taxes. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 had no impact on net income for 2002.

Minority interest in income of MAP

, which represents Ashland’s 38 percent ownership interest, increased by $129
million in 2003 from 2002, following a decrease of $531 million in 2002 from 2001. MAP income was higher in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the RM&T segment. MAP income was significantly lower in 2002 compared to 2001 as discussed
below in the RM&T segment.

Provision for income taxes

increased by $215 million in 2003 from 2002, following a decrease of $458 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily due to $720 million increase and $1.356 billion decrease in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.6%
compared to 42.1% and 37.1% for 2002 and 2001. The higher rate in 2002 was due to the United Kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the North Sea oil and gas production, retroactively effective to April 17, 2002. In
2002, Marathon recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $61 million as a result of the rate increase.

The following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented:

(a)

The deferred tax effect related to the enactment of a supplemental tax in the U.K. increased the effective tax rate 7.0 percent in 2002.



Discontinued operations

in 2003 primarily relates to Marathon’s E&P operations in western
Canada, which were sold in 2003 for a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million. Also, included in 2003 results is an $8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to United States Steel Corporation. Results for 2002 and 2001 have
been restated to reflect the western Canadian operations as discontinued. Results for 2001 also include the net loss attributed to Steel Stock, adjusted for certain corporate administrative expenses and interest expense (net of income tax effects),
and the loss on disposition of United States Steel Corporation, which is the excess of the net investment in United States Steel over the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding shares of the Steel Stock at the time of the Separation.

Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles

of $4 million, net of a tax provision of $4 million, in 2003 represents the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”), in which Marathon
recognized in income the cumulative effect of recording the fair value of asset retirement obligations. The $13 million gain, net of a tax provision of $7 million, in 2002 represents the adoption of subsequently issued interpretations by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”) in which Marathon must recognize in
income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom. The $8 million loss, net of a tax benefit of $5 million, in 2001 was an unfavorable transition adjustment related to the initial
adoption of SFAS No. 133.

Net income

increased by $805
million in 2003 from 2002 and by $359 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily reflecting the factors discussed above.

Income from operations

for each of the last three years is summarized in the following table:

(a)

Includes administrative expenses related to Steel Stock of $25 million for 2001.

(b)

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of business transformation costs.

(c)

The IMV reserve reflects the extent to which the recorded LIFO cost basis of inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products exceeds net realizable value.

(d)

The net gain in 2003 represents a gain on the disposition of interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. and certain fields in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming and SSA stores in Florida, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. In 2002, represents gain on exchange of certain oil and gas properties with XTO Energy, Inc.

(e)

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P.

(f)

In 2002 represents a settlement arising from the cancellation of the Cajun Express rig contract on July 5, 2001.

(g)

Represents costs related to the Separation from United States Steel.



Average Volumes and Selling Prices

(a)

Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

(b)

Amounts reflect production after royalties, excluding the U.K., Ireland and the Netherlands where amounts are before royalties.

(c)

Includes activity from CLAM and Chernogorskoye.

(d)

Represents equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries.

(e)

Includes gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 23.4, 4.4 and 8.1 mmcfd in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(f)

Total average daily volumes of all refined product sales to MAP’s wholesale, branded and retail (SSA) customers.

(g)

Per gallon

(h)

Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation.



Domestic E&P income

increased by $441 million in 2003 from 2002 following a decrease of $435
million in 2002 from 2001. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices, lower dry well expense and a $25 million favorable contract settlement, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural
gas volumes and derivative losses. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower volumes, lower derivative gains and higher dry well expense, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon prices. Derivative gains (losses)
totaled $(91) million in 2003, compared to $32 million in 2002 and $85 million in 2001.

Marathon’s domestic average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $27.02 per barrel (“bbl”) in 2003, compared with $22.35 per bbl in 2002 and $20.81 per bbl in 2001. Average gas
prices were $4.53 per thousand cubic feet (“mcf”) excluding derivative activity in 2003, compared with $2.87 per mcf in 2002 and $3.69 per mcf in 2001.

Domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 11 percent to 111 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in 2003,
as a result of natural declines mainly in the Gulf of Mexico and dispositions. Net natural gas production averaged 732 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”), down 2 percent from 2002.

Domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 8 percent to 125 mbpd
in 2002, as a result of natural declines principally in the Gulf of Mexico and dispositions. Net natural gas production averaged 745 mmcfd, down 6 percent from 2001.

International E&P income

increased by $8 million in 2003 from 2002 and $122 million in 2002 from 2001. The
increase in 2003 was a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and higher liquid hydrocarbon volumes partially offset by lower natural gas volumes and derivative losses. The increase in 2002 was a result of higher production
volumes and higher derivative gains partially offset by lower natural gas prices. Derivative gains (losses) totaled $(85) million in 2003, compared to $20 million in 2002 and $ – million in 2001. Derivatives included losses of $66 million in
2003, compared to gains of $18 million in 2002, related to long-term gas contracts in the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market.

Marathon’s international average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $26.24 per bbl in 2003,
compared with $23.85 per bbl and $23.74 per bbl in 2002 and 2001. Average gas prices were $2.80 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2003, compared with $2.35 per mcf and $2.83 per mcf in 2002 and 2001.

International net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 2 percent to 80
mbpd in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of KMOC, partially offset by lower production in the U.K. Net natural gas production averaged 364 mmcfd, down 5 percent from 2002, primarily from lower production in Ireland and the disposition of
Marathon’s interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. This decrease was partially offset by increased production in Equatorial Guinea.

International net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 26 percent to 78 mbpd in 2002 primarily due to the acquisition of interests in Equatorial
Guinea and increased production in the U.K. Net natural gas production averaged 382 mmcfd, up 7 percent from 2001, primarily due to higher production in Equatorial Guinea partially offset by lower production in the U.K.

RM&T segment income

increased by $414 million in 2003 from 2002
following a decrease of $1.558 billion in 2002 from 2001. The 2003 increase was primarily due to an improved refining and wholesale marketing margin, as well as a higher gasoline and distillate retail gross margin partially offset by higher
administrative expenses. The refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2003 averaged 6.0 cents per gallon, versus 2002 level of 3.9 cents. The gasoline and distillate gross margin for its retail business, was 12.3 cents per gallon in 2003, as
compared to 10.1 cents per gallon in 2002. The higher administrative expenses were due primarily to higher employee related costs. In 2002, the refining and wholesale marketing margin was severely compressed as crude oil costs increased while
average refined product prices decreased. The refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2002 averaged 3.9 cents per gallon, versus 2001 level of 11.7 cents.

Derivative losses, which are included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin, were $162 million in 2003 as compared to losses of $124 million and
gains of $210 million in 2002 and 2001. These derivative losses were generally incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases and to protect carrying values of excess inventories.

Gains on the sale of SSA stores included in segment income were $8 million,
$37 million, and $23 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001.



OERB segment income

decreased by $5 million in 2003 from 2002 and increased by $16 million in 2002
from 2001. The 2003 results include a gain of $34 million on the sale of Marathon’s interest in two refined product pipeline companies and earnings of $30 million from Marathon’s equity investment in the Equatorial Guinea methanol plant,
which were offset by an impairment charge of $22 million on an equity method investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of two tanker operating leases. The increase in 2002 reflected a favorable effect of $26 million from increased
margins in gas marketing activities and mark-to-market valuation changes in associated derivatives and earnings of $11 million from Marathon’s equity investment in the Equatorial Guinea methanol plant, partially offset by predevelopment costs
associated with emerging integrated gas projects.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity

Financial
Condition

Current assets

increased $1.561
billion from year-end 2002, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to approximately $1.256 billion in non-core asset sales in 2003. The increase in
receivables was mainly due to higher year-end commodity prices.

Current liabilities

increased $548 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, long-term debt due within one year and payroll and benefits payable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes and
interest. The increase in accounts payable was due to higher priced year-end crude purchases at MAP. The increase in payroll and benefits payable is primarily due to liabilities related to equity based compensation as a result of an increase in
Marathon’s stock price.

Investments and long-term
receivables

decreased $311 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P. and the sale of interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. in 2003.

Net property, plant and equipment

increased $440 million from year-end 2002. The increase in E&P international is
due to the construction of the Alba field Phase 2A expansion project in Equatorial Guinea and the acquisition of KMOC, partially offset by the disposition of properties in western Canada. The increase in RM&T is primarily due to the
Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery repositioning project and construction of the Cardinal Products Pipeline, partially offset by sales of SSA stores. The increase in OERB is primarily due to the purchase of a 30% interest in two LNG tankers which
Marathon previously leased and project development costs associated with Phase 3 in Equatorial Guinea. Net property, plant and equipment for each of the last two years is summarized in the following table:

Goodwill

decreased $18 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to the disposition of properties in western Canada.

Long-term debt

at December 31, 2003 was $4.085 billion, a decrease of $325 million from year-end 2002. See “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” on page 41, for further discussions.

Asset
retirement obligations

increased $167 million from year-end 2002 primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and the acquisition of KMOC, partially offset by disposition of properties in western Canada.



Cash Flows

Net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations)

totaled $2.678 billion in 2003, compared with $2.336 billion in 2002 and
$2.749 billion in 2001. The increase in 2003 mainly reflects the effects of higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices and a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin. Additionally in 2003, MAP made cash contributions to its
pension plans of $89 million. The decrease in 2002 mainly reflects the effects of lower refined product margins and lower prices for natural gas.

Net cash provided from operating activities (for discontinued operations)

totaled $83 million in 2003, compared with $69 million in 2002 and $887
million in 2001. This is primarily related to Marathon’s E&P operations in western Canada sold in 2003. Also included in 2001 is the business of United States Steel.

Capital expenditures

for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table:

(a)

Amounts exclude the acquisitions of KMOC in 2003, the Equatorial Guinea interests in 2002 and Pennaco in 2001.

Capital expenditures in 2003 totaled $1.892 billion compared with $1.520
billion and $1.533 billion in 2002 and 2001, excluding the acquisitions of KMOC in 2003, Equatorial Guinea interests in 2002 and Pennaco in 2001. The $372 million increase in 2003 mainly reflected increased spending in the RM&T segment at the
Catlettsburg refinery and on the Cardinal Products Pipeline and in the E&P segment in West Africa and Norway. The increase in OERB is due to the purchase of 30% interest in two LNG tankers which Marathon previously leased and project development
costs associated with Phase 3 in Equatorial Guinea. The $13 million decrease in 2002 mainly reflected decreased spending in the E&P segment offset by increased spending in the RM&T segment. The decrease in the E&P segment was primarily
due to the drilling of fewer gas wells in the United States in 2002 partially offset by higher capital expenditures for completion of a pipeline in Gabon, for a pipeline construction contract in Ireland and for development expenditures in Equatorial
Guinea. The increase in the RM&T segment in 2002 was attributable to increased spending on the multi-year integrated investment program at MAP’s Catlettsburg refinery and construction of the Cardinal Products Pipeline in 2002, partially
offset by lower capital expenditures for SSA retail outlets and completion of the Garyville coker construction in 2001. The decrease in corporate in 2002 was primarily due to the implementation of SAP financial and operations software in 2001.

Acquisitions

included cash payments of $252 million in
2003 for the acquisition of KMOC, $1.160 billion in 2002 for the acquisitions of Equatorial Guinea interests and $506 million in 2001 for the acquisition of Pennaco. For further discussion of acquisitions, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Cash from disposal of assets

was $1.256
billion, including the disposal of discontinued operations, in 2003, compared with $146 million in 2002 and $83 million in 2001. In 2003, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of Marathon’s E&P properties in western Canada, Yates
field and gathering system, interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V., SSA stores, interest in several pipeline companies and certain fields in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. In 2002, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of various SSA stores and the
sale of San Juan Basin assets. In 2001, proceeds were primarily from the sale of certain Canadian assets, SSA stores, and various domestic producing properties.

Net cash used in financing activities

totaled $888 million in 2003, compared with net cash provided of $88 million in 2002 and net cash used of
$1.290 billion in 2001. The decrease was due to activity in 2002 primarily associated with financing the acquisitions of Equatorial Guinea interests of $1.160 billion. This was partially offset by the $295 million repayment of preferred securities
in 2002 that became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the Separation. In early January 2002, Marathon paid $185 million to retire the 6.75% Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities and $110 million to retire the
6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, distributions to the minority shareholder of MAP were $262 million in 2003,



compared to $176 million and $577 million in 2002 and 2001. The cash used in 2001 primarily reflects distributions to the minority shareholder of MAP,
dividends paid and the redemption of the 8.75 percent Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred Shares.

Derivative Instruments

See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” on page 52, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.

Dividends to Stockholders

On January 25, 2004, the Marathon Board of Directors declared a dividend of 25 cents per share on Marathon’s common stock, payable March 10, 2004, to
stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Marathon’s main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. Marathon’s ability
to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. Because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Marathon, including internally generated cash flow, Marathon’s management believes
that its short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with
contingencies.

Marathon’s senior unsecured debt is
currently rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings with ratings of BBB+, Baa1, and BBB+, respectively.

Marathon has a committed $1.354 billion long-term revolving credit facility that terminates in November 2005 and a committed
$575 million 364-day revolving credit facility that terminates in November 2004. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against these facilities. At December 31, 2003, Marathon had no commercial paper outstanding under the U.S. commercial
paper program that is backed by the long-term revolving credit facility. Additionally, Marathon has other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, of which no amounts were drawn at December 31, 2003.

MAP has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with Ashland that expires
in March 2004 and is expected to be renewed until March 2005. As of December 31, 2003, MAP did not have any borrowings against this facility.

In 2002, Marathon filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering $2.7 billion aggregate amount
of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities and/or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities. As of December 31, 2003, no
securities had been offered under this shelf registration statement.

Marathon held cash and cash equivalents of $1.396 billion at December 31, 2003, compared to $488 million at December 31, 2002. The increase primarily reflects proceeds from asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2003. Marathon expects to
utilize a substantial portion of this cash to fund operations, including its capital and investment program, and to repay debt in 2004.

Marathon’s cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 33 percent at December 31, 2003,
compared to 45 percent at year-end 2002. This includes approximately $605 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel.



The table below provides aggregated information on Marathon’s obligations to make future payments
under existing contracts as of December 31, 2003:

Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations

(a)

Upon the Separation, United States Steel assumed certain debt and lease obligations. Such amounts have been included in the above table to reflect the fact that Marathon remains
primarily liable.

(b)

The majority of 2004’s contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of
the year.

(c)

Marathon has acquired the right to deliver to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal 58 bcf of natural gas per year. The agreement’s primary term ends in 2021. Pursuant
to this agreement, Marathon has also bound itself to a commitment to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the LNG re-gasification terminal.

(d)

Services and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.

(e)

Marathon is a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline. This agreement is used by Alliance Pipeline to secure its financing. This arrangement
represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. Therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. See Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of Marathon’s guarantee.

(f)

Commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs within contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are subject to immediate expense, such as
geological and geophysical costs.

(g)

Marathon has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post retirement benefits including medical and life insurance. Marathon has estimated projected funding
through 2013 with the exception of the pension plan for employees in Ireland where only 2004 information was included.

(h)

Includes $733 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by United States Steel. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel – Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations Assumed by United States Steel” on page 44.

Contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are
not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table. These include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors.

Marathon management’s opinion concerning liquidity and Marathon’s ability to avail itself in the future of the
financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. To the extent that this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that
affect the availability of financing include the performance of Marathon (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of
past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in



particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of Marathon’s outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may
potentially impact Marathon’s liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a
variety of Marathon’s business purposes, Marathon is not dependent on these arrangements to maintain its liquidity and capital resources; nor is management aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet
arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.

Marathon has provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, United States Steel and certain lease contracts. These arrangements are described in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Marathon is a party to agreements that would require Marathon
to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interests in MAP and in Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”) not currently owned. These put/call agreements are described in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonrecourse Indebtedness of Investees

Certain equity investees of Marathon have incurred indebtedness that
Marathon does not support through guarantees or otherwise. If Marathon were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata basis, its share would have been approximately $307 million as of December 31, 2003. Of this amount, $173 million relates to
PTC. If any of these equity investees default, Marathon has no obligation to support the debt. Marathon’s partner in PTC has guaranteed $157 million of the total PTC debt.

Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel

On December 31, 2001, Marathon disposed of its steel business through a
tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary United States Steel to holders of its USX—U. S. Steel Group class of common stock (“Steel Stock”) in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a
one-for-one basis (the “Separation”).

Marathon
remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the Separation. United States Steel’s obligations to
Marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. If United States Steel fails to satisfy these obligations, Marathon would become responsible for
repayment. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of
security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases.

As of December 31, 2003, Marathon has identified the following obligations
totaling $699 million that have been assumed by United States Steel:

•

$470 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former United States Steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009
through 2033. Accrued interest payable on these bonds was $8 million at December 31, 2003.

•

$76 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. There was no
accrued interest payable on this financing at December 31, 2003.

•

$59 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Clairton cokemaking facility, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. There was no
accrued interest payable on this financing at December 31, 2003.

•

$72 million of operating lease obligations, of which $54 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by United States Steel.

•

A guarantee of United States Steel’s $14 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture PRO-TEC Coating Company.



•

A guarantee of all obligations of United States Steel as general partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P. to the limited partners. United States Steel has reported that it
currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. For further discussion of the Clairton 1314B guarantee, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Of the total $699 million, obligations of $613 million and corresponding
receivables from United States Steel were recorded on Marathon’s consolidated balance sheet (current portion—$20 million; long-term portion—$593 million). The remaining $86 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and
contingent liabilities of United States Steel.

The table below
provides aggregated information on the portion of Marathon’s obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by United States Steel as of December 31, 2003:

Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations Assumed by United States Steel

Each of Marathon and
United States Steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or before December 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting
group for those periods. Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before December 31, 2001. The agreement includes indemnification provisions to
address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party. In 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement,
Marathon paid $16 million to United States Steel in connection with the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of USX Corporation for the years 1992 through 1994.

United States Steel reported in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2003, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. However, United States
Steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. During periods of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy, United States Steel believes that it can maintain
adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending, sale of non-strategic assets and other cash conservation measures.

Transactions with Related Parties

Marathon owns a combined 63.3% working interest in the Alba field. Marathon owns a net 52.2% interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing
plant through an equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC. Additionally, Marathon owns a 45% net interest in an onshore methanol production plant through an equity method investee, Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Marathon
sells its marketed natural gas from the Alba field to Alba Plant LLC and AMPCO. AMPCO uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through AMPCO Marketing LLC.

MAP’s related party sales to its 50% equity method investee, PTC, consists primarily of refined petroleum products
which accounted for approximately 2% of its total sales revenue for 2003. PTC is the largest travel center network in the United States and operates 257 travel centers nationwide. MAP also sells refined petroleum products consisting mainly of
petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to Ashland which owns a 38% interest in MAP. MAP’s sales to Ashland accounted for approximately 1% of its total sales revenue for 2003. Management believes that these transactions were conducted under
terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies

Marathon has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital,
operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of Marathon’s products and services,
operating results will be adversely affected. Marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of
factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.

Marathon’s environmental expenditures for each of the last three years
were

(a)

:

(a)

Amounts are determined based on American Petroleum Institute survey guidelines and include 100 percent of MAP.

(b)

These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.

Marathon’s environmental capital
expenditures accounted for 17 percent of total capital expenditures in 2003, eight percent in 2002, and six percent in 2001.

Marathon accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be
reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.

Marathon has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at nine waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) as of December 31, 2003. In addition, there are 4 sites where Marathon has received information requests or
other indications that Marathon may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. At many of these sites, Marathon is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost
of remediation, as well as Marathon’s share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies.

There are also 125 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental
statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 16 were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland for which Ashland has retained liability for all
costs associated with remediation.

New or expanded
environmental requirements, which could increase Marathon’s environmental costs, may arise in the future. Marathon intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently
determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.

Marathon’s environmental capital expenditures are
expected to be approximately $415 million or 20% of capital expenditures in 2004. Predictions beyond 2004 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently identified projects, Marathon anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be
approximately $425 million in 2005; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional
projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.



New Tier 2 gasoline and on-road diesel fuel rules require substantially reduced sulfur levels for
gasoline and diesel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. The combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006 and includes
costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. This is a forward-looking statement. Costs incurred through December 31, 2003, were approximately $205 million. Some factors (among others) that could potentially affect
gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits, completion of project detailed engineering, and project construction and logistical considerations.

MAP has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office since 2002 concerning MAP’s self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MAP has had
periodic discussions with Illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions are anticipated in 2004.

During 2001, MAP entered into a New Source Review consent decree and settlement of alleged Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and other violations with the
U. S. Environmental Protection Agency covering all of MAP’s refineries. The settlement committed MAP to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to MAP’s refineries over
approximately an eight-year period. The total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $330 million over the eight-year period, with about $170 million incurred through December 31, 2003. The impact of the settlement
on ongoing operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. In addition, MAP has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA violations, at a cost of $9
million. MAP believes that this settlement will provide MAP with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions.

Other Contingencies

Marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies in over forty recently filed cases in thirteen states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl
ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing a defective product
and that owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed MTBE to be discharged into the groundwater. Several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of Marathon’s marketing area. A few of the cases seek approval as
class actions. Many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. Marathon has stopped producing MTBE at its refineries. The potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases
is uncertain. Marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases.

Marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of
these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Marathon. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
unfavorably to Marathon. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”.



Outlook

Realignment of Business Segments

In January 2004, Marathon changed its business segments to fully reflect all the operations of the integrated gas strategy within a single segment. In the
first quarter of 2004, Marathon will realign its segment reporting and introduce a new business segment, Integrated Gas. This segment will initially include Marathon’s Alaska LNG operations, Equatorial Guinea methanol operations, and natural
gas marketing and transportation activities, along with expenses related to the continued development of an integrated gas business. Crude oil marketing and transportation activities, previously reported in other energy related businesses, will be
reported in the exploration and production segment. Refined product transportation activities not included in MAP, also previously reported in other energy related businesses, will be reported in the refining, marketing and transportation segment.
The following represents unaudited information for the realigned operating segment for the previous three years:

(a)

Management believes intersegment transactions and transactions with United States Steel were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.

(b)

Differences between segment totals and Marathon totals represent impairments and amounts related to corporate administrative activities.

(c)

Differences between segment totals and Marathon totals represent amounts related to corporate administrative activities.



Capital, Investment and Exploration Budget

Marathon’s has approved a capital, investment and exploration expenditure budget of approximately $2.26 billion for
2004. The primary focus of the 2004 budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen RM&T assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy through Phase 3 in Equatorial Guinea. The budget
includes worldwide production capital spending of $810 million primarily in Equatorial Guinea, Russia, Norway and the Gulf of Mexico. The worldwide exploration and exploitation budget of $302 million includes plans to drill 11 significant
exploration wells in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Norway, the Gulf of Mexico and Nova Scotia. Exploitation activities will focus on projects primarily in the United States. The budget includes $788 million for RM&T projects, primarily for refinery
upgrade projects for the production of low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel and the Detroit refinery expansion. The integrated gas budget of $263 million is primarily for the development of the LNG project on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. The
remaining $96 million balance is designated for corporate activities and capitalized interest.

Exploration and Production

The outlook regarding Marathon’s upstream revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Prices have historically been volatile and have frequently
been affected by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political developments in the world’s major oil and gas producing and consuming areas. Any significant decline in prices
could have a material adverse effect on Marathon’s results of operations. A prolonged decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of
capital available for exploration and development.

Marathon
estimates its 2004 and 2005 production will average 365,000 BOEPD, excluding the effect of any acquisitions or dispositions. Marathon replaced 124 percent of production, excluding dispositions, during 2003. Also during the year, the company divested
non-core upstream assets with 274 million BOE of proved reserves. Excluding acquisitions and dispositions, Marathon replaced approximately 76 percent of production. At year end, Marathon had proved reserves of 1.042 billion BOE.

Exploration

Major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include:

•

Angola, where Marathon recently participated in the drilling of the Venus exploration well on Block 31 and the Canela well on Block 32. Plans are to participate in two to four
additional exploration wells in this area during 2004;

•

Norway, where Marathon has interests in twelve licenses in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and plans to drill two exploration wells during 2004, one of which is anticipated to
be in the Alvheim area;

•

Gulf of Mexico, where Marathon plans to participate in two deepwater and two shelf exploration wells during 2004;

Equatorial Guinea, where Marathon is currently evaluating the results of recent drilling in the Deep Luba prospect, which will test for potential resources under the Alba field and
plans to drill one or two additional exploration wells in 2004;

•

Eastern Canada, where Marathon plans to drill one exploration well on the Annapolis lease during 2004.

Production

In Equatorial Guinea, Marathon’s Phase 2A expansion project came on-stream during the fourth quarter. This project began producing less than 15
months after its approval and less than two years since Marathon’s acquisition of its interests in Equatorial Guinea. By year-end 2003, gross condensate production had grown from 18,000 to 30,000 bpd. The Phase 2B LPG expansion project is on
schedule with an expected start-up near the end of 2004. Full LPG production of 20,000 bpd gross (11,600 bpd net) is expected in early 2005. Phase 2A and Phase 2B full condensate production of 59,000 bpd gross (32,600 bpd net to Marathon) is
expected in early 2005.

In Russia, Marathon’s acquisition
of KMOC in 2003 resulted in additional proved reserves of approximately 95 million BOE. Current net daily production of 16,000 net bpd from these operations is expected to increase to more than 60,000 net bpd within five years.



In Norway, Marathon is evaluating development options associated with the exploration success in Alvheim
and Klegg. Marathon and its partners are evaluating several development scenarios for Alvheim, in which Marathon is operator and holds a 65 percent interest. Marathon expects to submit a development plan to the Norwegian authorities during the
second quarter of 2004. Marathon holds a 47 percent interest in Klegg and expects a development plan to be approved in 2004. Production from these combined developments is expected to reach more than 50,000 net bpd during 2007. On February 23, 2004,
Marathon and its Alvheim project partners announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a multipurpose shuttle tanker.

In the Gulf of Mexico, Marathon and its partners in the Neptune Unit are integrating the results of this discovery into field development studies and plan
to spud another appraisal well on this discovery during the first quarter of 2004. Marathon holds a 30 percent interest in the Neptune Unit.

In December 2003, Marathon and its partners, in the Corrib project offshore Ireland, submitted a new planning application to construct an onshore gas
terminal for the Corrib natural gas discovery. Final planning approval for the onshore terminal is expected by the end of 2004.

In Qatar, Marathon and three other companies are exploring the possibility of developing a portion of the North field offshore Qatar, including
infrastructure for gas processing facilities and a GTL plant.

In Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, Marathon plans to drill approximately 400 coal bed natural gas wells in 2004.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of Marathon’s worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural
gas production, the exploration drilling program, possible additional resources, the Phase 2B LNG expansion project, the possibility of an equipment purchase, and the expected date for final planning approval for an onshore terminal. Some factors
that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, the exploration drilling program and possible additional resources include acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, pricing,
supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells,
drilling rig availability, achieving definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other geological,
operating and economic considerations. Factors that could affect the Phase 2B LPG expansion project include unforeseen problems arising from construction and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. Factors affecting the possibility of the
equipment purchase include the partners’ approval of the development of the Alvheim area and the subsequent approval of a plan of development and operation by the Norwegian authorities. The final planning approval for the onshore terminal is
contingent upon governmental approval. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Marathon’s RM&T segment income is largely dependent upon the refining and wholesale marketing margin for refined
products, the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates, and the gross margin on retail merchandise sales. The refining and wholesale marketing margin reflects the difference between the wholesale selling prices of refined products and the
cost of raw materials refined, purchased product costs and manufacturing expenses. Refining and wholesale marketing margins have been historically volatile and vary from the impact of competition and with the level of economic activity in the
various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, the seasonal pattern of certain product sales, crude oil costs, manufacturing costs, the available supply of crude oil and refined products, and logistical constraints. The retail gross margin for
gasoline and distillates reflects the difference between the retail selling prices of these products and their wholesale cost, including secondary transportation. Retail gasoline and distillate margins have also been historically volatile, but tend
to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin. Factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in
the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. The gross margin on retail merchandise sales tends to be less volatile than the retail gasoline and distillate margin. Factors affecting the gross margin on retail
merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in the marketing area.



MAP has completed the approximately $440 million multi-year Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery
repositioning project. This major operations improvement project includes the deactivation of the existing, old fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) and the conversion and expansion of the existing atmospheric residue catalytic cracking unit into an
FCCU. This project is expected to increase the value of the refined products produced at Catlettsburg, improve cost efficiency and enable the refinery to meet new low sulfur gasoline standards. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004.

MAP has commenced approximately $300 million in new capital
projects for its 74,000 bpd Detroit, Michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the
refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects are scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan MAP the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects.

A MAP subsidiary, Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”),
completed a 150-mile refined product pipeline from Kenova, West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio in late 2003. The pipeline is an interstate common carrier pipeline. The pipeline is known as Cardinal Products Pipeline and is expected to initially move
about 36,000 bpd of refined petroleum into the central Ohio region. The pipeline, which has a capacity of up to 80,000 bpd, is expected to provide a stable, cost effective supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuels to this market.

Overlapping planned maintenance projects, including investments in the
“Tier 2” ultra-low sulfur gasoline production upgrades, will reduce MAP’s 935,000 bpd crude oil capacity such that it expects to process about 775,000 bpd of crude oil in the first quarter of 2004. MAP expects its average crude oil
throughput for the total year 2004 to be at or above historical levels.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit capital projects and the Cardinal Products Pipeline system. Some factors that could affect the Detroit construction projects include availability of
materials and labor, permitting approvals, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could impact the Cardinal Products Pipeline include the price of petroleum
products and other supply issues. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Integrated Gas

Marathon continues to make progress on its Phase 3 expansion project in Equatorial Guinea. To commercialize the significant gas resources in Equatorial
Guinea’s Alba field, Marathon, the Government of Equatorial Guinea and GEPetrol, the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea, have signed a heads of agreement on a package of fiscal terms and conditions for the development of the LNG project
on Bioko Island. Marathon and GEPetrol plan to develop a 3.4 million metric tonnes per year LNG plant, with start up currently projected for late 2007. Marathon and GEPetrol have also signed a letter of understanding (LOU) with a subsidiary of BG
Group plc (“BGML”) under which BGML would purchase the LNG plant’s production for a period of 17 years on an FOB Bioko Island basis with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. The LNG would be targeted primarily to a
receiving terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline grid. The provisions of the LOU are subject to a definitive purchase and sale agreement which the parties expect to
finalize by the second quarter of 2004. Pending final approval of all commercial and governmental agreements, a final investment decision is expected to be concluded by second quarter 2004.

The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the
estimated construction and startup dates of a LNG liquefaction plant and related facilities and the purchase of LNG by BGML. Factors that could affect the purchase of LNG by BGML and the estimated construction and startup dates of the LNG
liquefaction plant and related facilities include, without limitation, the successful negotiation and execution of a definitive purchase and sale agreement for LNG supply, board approval of the transactions, approval of the LNG project by the
Government of Equatorial Guinea, unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, arranging sufficient financing, unanticipated
changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause
actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.



Corporate Matters

Marathon has announced organizational and business process changes to increase efficiency, profitability and shareholder value and to achieve projected
annual pretax savings of more than $135 million, including $70 million related to MAP. It is anticipated that most of these changes will be completed during the first half 2004, and will result in pretax charges of approximately $75 million ($10
million of which is related to MAP), including benefit plan curtailment and settlement effects of $24 million. Approximately $24 million of the estimated $75 million charges has been recorded in 2003, with the remainder to be recognized when
incurred during the first half 2004.

Marathon expects that
pension and other postretirement plan expense in 2004 will increase approximately $65 million from 2003 levels, of which approximately $21 million relates to MAP. The total includes $34 million related to pension plan settlements as a result of
the business transformation. MAP, and Marathon’s foreign subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $93 million and $22 million to the funded pension plans in 2004.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projected annual cost savings from organizational
and business process improvements, the projected completion time for implementation of the changes and pension and other postretirement plan expenses. Factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could adversely affect these expected results
include possible delays in consolidating the U.S. production organization, future acquisitions or dispositions, technological developments, actions of government or other regulatory bodies in areas affected by these organizational changes,
unforeseen hazards, regulatory impacts, and other economic or political considerations. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

An issue currently on the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
agenda, Issue No. 03-S “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, to Oil and Gas Companies,” will address how oil and gas companies should classify the costs of acquiring contractual mineral
interests in oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. The EITF is considering an alternative interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” that mineral or drilling rights or
leases, concessions or other interests representing the right to extract oil or gas should be classified as intangible assets rather than oil and gas properties. Management believes that our current balance sheet classification for these costs is
appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. If a reclassification is ultimately required, the estimated amount of the leasehold acquisition costs to be reclassified would be $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and
2002. Should such a change be required, there would be no impact on our previously filed income statements (or reported net income), statements of cash flow or statements of stockholders’ equity for prior periods. Additional disclosures related
to intangible assets would also be required.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Management Opinion Concerning Derivative Instruments

Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.

Marathon uses commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the
purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. To a lesser extent, Marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials.

Marathon’s strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for
its products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. Marathon will use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage
commodity price risk within its different businesses. As market conditions change, Marathon evaluates its risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be
based on market prices.

Marathon’s E&P segment
primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to selectively lock in realized prices on portions of its future production when deemed advantageous to do so.

Marathon’s RM&T segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock
purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed-price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. MAP recently expanded its trading strategies (through
the use of sold options) to take advantage of opportunities in the commodity markets.

Marathon’s OERB segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. Marathon uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes
and anticipated sales volumes.

Marathon uses financial
derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures. As Marathon enters into derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting.

Management believes that use of derivative instruments along with risk
assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose Marathon to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect Marathon’s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. Management
believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity.



Commodity Price Risk

Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10
percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, are provided in the following table:

(a)

(a)

Marathon remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item.
Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. Amounts reflect hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis swaps, for each open contract position at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Marathon
evaluates its portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions and changes in risk profiles. Marathon is also exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements to the extent practical. Changes to the portfolio after December 31, 2003, would cause future
IFO effects to differ from those presented in the table.

(b)

Net open contracts for the combined E&P and OERB segments varied throughout 2003, from a low of 24,375 contracts at October 8 to a high of 52,470 contracts at October 17, and
averaged 37,068 for the year. The number of net open contracts for the RM&T segment varied throughout 2003, from a low of 30 contracts at July 19 to a high of 23,412 contracts at December 4, and averaged 9,850 for the year. The derivative
commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects.

(c)

The calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. Gains and losses on options are based on changes in
intrinsic value only.

(d)

The direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in IFO when
applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity.

(e)

Price increase.

E&P Segment

At
December 31, 2003 the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding. All contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting unless noted.

(a)

These contracts may be subject to margin calls above certain limits established by counterparties.

(b)

Volumes and percentages are based on the estimated production on an annualized basis.

Derivative gains (losses) included in the E&P segment were $(176) million, $52 million and $85 million for 2003, 2002
and 2001. Losses of $66 million and gains of $18 million are included in segment results for 2003 and 2002, respectively, on long-term gas contracts in the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market.
Additionally, losses of $8 million and gains of $23 million from discontinued cash flow hedges are included in segment results for 2003 and 2002. The discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur.



RM&T Segment

Marathon’s RM&T operations primarily use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock
purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. Derivative instruments are used to mitigate the price
risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. In addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price
risk associated with approximately 60% of the anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use through the first quarter of 2004 and 50% through the second quarter of 2004. Derivative commodity instruments are also used to protect the value of
excess refined product, crude oil and LPG inventories. Derivatives are used to lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers. Derivative commodity instruments are used to protect against
decreases in the future crack spreads. Within a limited framework, derivative instruments are also used to take advantage of opportunities identified in the commodity markets. Derivative gains (losses) included in RM&T segment income for each of
the last two years are summarized in the following table:

Generally, derivative
losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity
transaction.

OERB Segment

Marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a
long-term gas sales contract to market prices. The underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. Similarly, Marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year)
fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. Derivative gains (losses) included in OERB segment income were $19 million, $(8) million and
$(29) million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. OERB’s trading activity gains (losses) of $(7) million, $4 million and $(1) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are included in the aforementioned amounts.

Other Commodity Risk

Marathon is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect the
relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from
prices experienced in local markets. For example, New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) contracts for natural gas are priced at Louisiana’s Henry Hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the
western United States at prices that do not move in strict correlation with NYMEX prices. To the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the
expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. These regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. OTC transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk.

Marathon is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating
contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. Due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions.



Interest Rate Risk

Marathon is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations affecting the fair value of certain financial instruments.
A sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table:

(a)

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in
interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.

(b)

See Note 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for carrying value of instruments.

(c)

For long-term debt, this assumes a 10% decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of Marathon’s long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002. For interest rate swap
agreements, this assumes a 10% decrease in the effective swap rate at December 31, 2003.

(d)

Includes amounts due within one year.

(e)

Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Marathon’s portfolio of long-term debt
was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is illustrated by the $176 million increase in the fair value of
long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. However, Marathon’s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect Marathon’s
results and cash flows only to the extent that Marathon would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value.

Marathon has initiated a program to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative
instruments. The primary objective of this program is to reduce Marathon’s overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. Beginning in 2002, Marathon entered into several interest rate swap
agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. The following table summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the
interest rate swap activity as of December 31, 2003:



Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Marathon has a program to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward contracts. The primary
objective of this program is to reduce Marathon’s exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. As of December 31, 2003, Marathon had no open contracts.

Credit Risk

Marathon has significant credit risk exposure to United States Steel arising from the Separation. That exposure is discussed
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel” on page 43.

Safe Harbor

Marathon’s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect
to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. These statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined
products and other feedstocks. To the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to Marathon’s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Principal Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation

— Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of USX
Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name
to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction discussed in the next paragraph (the Separation), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect Marathon Oil
Corporation and its subsidiaries as the continuation of the consolidated enterprise.

Prior to December 31, 2001, Marathon
had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock (Common Stock), which was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon’s energy business, and USX—U.S. Steel Group common stock (Steel Stock), which was
intended to reflect the performance of Marathon’s steel business. As described further in Note 3, on December 31, 2001, Marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary
United States Steel Corporation (United States Steel) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In connection with the Separation, Marathon’s certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and, from that date,
Marathon has only one class of common stock authorized.

Marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of
crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its 62 percent owned consolidated subsidiary Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP); and other energy related businesses.

Principles applied in consolidation

— These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the businesses comprising Marathon.

The assets and liabilities of
MAP are consolidated in these financial statements and minority interest representing 38 percent of the carrying value of the net assets of MAP has been recognized. Under certain circumstances, the MAP Limited Liability Company Agreement requires
unanimous approval of certain matters brought to the MAP Board of Managers. Marathon does not believe that the rights of the minority shareholder of MAP are substantive because the likelihood of those rights being triggered is remote.

Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures and undivided interests in certain pipelines, gas processing plants and liquefied
natural gas (LNG) tankers are consolidated on a pro rata basis.

Investments in entities over which Marathon has significant
influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at Marathon’s share of net assets plus loans and advances. Differences in the basis of the investment and the separate net asset value of the investee, if any,
are amortized into income in accordance with the remaining useful life of the underlying assets.

Investments in companies
whose stock is publicly traded are carried at market value. The difference between the cost of these investments and market value is recorded in other comprehensive income (net of tax). Investments in companies whose stock has no readily
determinable fair value are carried at cost.

Income from equity method investments represents Marathon’s proportionate
share of income from equity method investments. Other income includes dividend income from other investments. Dividend income is recognized when dividend payments are received.

Gains or losses from a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary or an unconsolidated investee are recognized in the period of
change.

Use of estimates

— The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at year-end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, equity method investments and
non-exchange traded derivative contracts; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets; environmental remediation liabilities; liabilities for potential tax deficiencies and potential litigation claims and
settlements; assets and obligations related to employee benefits; and the classification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

Income per common share

— Basic net income (loss) per
share is calculated by adjusting net income for dividend requirements of preferred stock and is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share assumes exercise of stock options and warrants and
conversion of convertible debt and preferred securities, provided the effect is not antidilutive.

F-8


Segment information

— Marathon’s operations consist of three reportable operating
segments:

•

Exploration and Production (“E&P”)—explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis;

•

Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”)—refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains
and southeastern United States through MAP; and

•

Other Energy Related Businesses (“OERB”)—markets and transports its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as
liquefied natural gas and methanol, primarily in the United States, Europe and West Africa.

Management has determined that these are its operating segments because these are the components of Marathon (i) that engage in business
activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by Marathon’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated and assess performance and
(iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is responsible for performing the functions within Marathon of allocating resources to and assessing performance of Marathon’s
operating segments. Information on assets by segment is not provided because it is not reviewed by the CODM. The CODM is also the manager over each of the segments. In this role, he is responsible for allocating resources within the segments,
reviewing financial results of components within the segments, and assessing the performance of the components. The components within the segments that are separately reviewed and assessed by the CODM in his role as segment manager are aggregable
with other components in the same segment because they have similar economic characteristics.

Segment income represents
income from operations allocable to operating segments. Marathon corporate general and administrative costs are not allocated to operating segments. These costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional
services, facilities and other related costs associated with corporate activities. Inventory market valuation adjustments and gain (loss) on ownership change in MAP also are not allocated to operating segments. Additionally, certain nonoperating or
infrequently occurring items are not allocated to operating segments (see segment income reconcilement table on page F-21).

Revenue recognition

— Revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to customers and the sales price is
fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Costs associated with revenues are recorded in costs of revenues.

Marathon recognizes revenues from the production of oil and gas in the United States when title is transferred. Outside the United States, revenues are recognized at the time of lifting. Royalties on the production of oil and gas are either
paid in cash or settled through the delivery of volumes. Marathon includes royalties in its revenue and cost of revenues when settlement of royalties is paid in cash, while settlement of royalties based on the delivery of volumes are excluded from
revenue and cost of revenues.

Rebates from vendors are recognized as a reduction to cost of revenues when the initiating
transaction occurs. Incentives that are derived from contractual provisions are accrued based on past experience and recognized within cost of revenues.

Matching buy/sell transactions settled in cash are recorded in both revenues and costs of revenues as separate sales and purchase transactions.

Marathon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances and would recognize a liability if the existing proved
reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with maturities generally of three months or less.

Inventories

— Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

The inventory market
valuation reserve reflects the extent that the recorded LIFO cost basis of crude oil and refined products inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is decreased to reflect increases in market prices and inventory turnover and increased
to reflect decreases in market prices. Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve result in noncash charges or credits to costs and expenses.

Derivative instruments

— Marathon uses commodity-based derivatives and financial instrument related derivatives to manage its exposure
to commodity price risk, interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. As market conditions change, Marathon may use selective derivative instruments that assume market risk in exchange for an upfront premium. Management has authorized the use of
futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, including written or net written options, related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, fair value of certain assets and liabilities, future interest
expense and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income, within revenues, other income, costs of revenues or net interest and other financing
costs,

F-9


unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows or certain foreign currency exposures. Cash flows related to the use of derivatives are
classified in operating activities with the underlying hedged transaction.

For derivatives qualifying as hedges of future
cash flows or certain foreign currency exposures, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in a component of stockholders’ equity called other comprehensive income and then reclassified to income, within revenues, costs
of revenues or net interest and other financing costs, when the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in income as it occurs. For discontinued cash flow hedges prospective changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recognized in income. Any gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income at the time a hedge is discontinued continues to be deferred until the original forecasted transaction occurs. However, if it is determined
that the likelihood of the original forecasted transaction occurring is no longer probable, the entire gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified into income.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of recognized assets, liabilities or firm commitments, changes in the fair value of
both the hedged item and the related derivative are recognized immediately in income, within revenues, costs of revenues or net interest and other financing costs, with an offsetting effect included in the basis of the hedged item. The net effect is
to reflect in income the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

For
derivative instruments that are classified as trading, changes in the fair value are recognized immediately within revenues as part of other income. Any premium received is amortized into income based on the underlying settlement terms of the
derivative position. All related effects of a trading strategy, including physical settlement of the derivative position, are reflected within other income.

Property, plant and equipment

— Marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Costs
to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves,
geological and geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed.

Capitalized costs
of producing oil and gas properties are depreciated and depleted by the units-of-production method. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Marathon evaluates its oil and gas producing properties for impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by
logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure, using undiscounted future cash flows based on total proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written
down to their fair value, as determined by discounted future cash flows based on total proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves or, if available, comparable market values. Unproved oil and gas properties that are individually
significant are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment. Other unproved properties are amortized over their remaining holding period.

For property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities, depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 42 years.

When property, plant and equipment depreciated on an
individual basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reflected in income. Gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is
expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as held for sale. Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment depreciated on a group basis are credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization with no
immediate effect on income.

Goodwill

—
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, primarily from the acquisitions of the Equatorial Guinea interests and Pennaco Energy, Inc. Annually, Marathon assesses the carrying
amount of goodwill by testing for impairment. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and other assets and liabilities to reporting units. Marathon has determined the components of the E&P segment have similar economic characteristics
and therefore, aggregates the components into a single reporting unit. As a result, goodwill has been assigned to the E&P segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then the recorded goodwill is impaired down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense.

Intangible assets

— Intangible assets consists of deferred marketing costs, intangible contract rights,
proprietary information, and unrecognized pension plan prior service costs. The marketing costs incurred in the RM&T segment relate to refurbishment of various branded jobber locations. These marketing costs are amortized over 5-10 years
depending on the term of the associated marketing agreement. Additionally, Marathon has intangibles in OERB associated with the acquisition of a contractual right to utilize the Elba Island LNG terminal in Savannah, Georgia. These rights are being
amortized over the expected life of the contract.

F-10


Major maintenance activities

— Marathon incurs planned major maintenance costs
primarily for refinery turnarounds. Such costs are expensed in the same annual period as incurred; however, estimated annual turnaround costs are recognized in income throughout the year on a pro rata basis.

Environmental remediation liabilities

— Environmental
remediation expenditures are capitalized if the costs mitigate or prevent future contamination or if the costs improve environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets. Marathon provides for remediation costs and penalties when the
responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action. Remediation
liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably fixed and determinable. If recoveries of remediation costs from third parties are probable, a receivable is
recorded.

Asset retirement obligations

—
The fair value of asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. For Marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas
producing facilities. Asset retirement obligations include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed, including those leased.
Estimates of these costs are developed for each property based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations
with construction and engineering professionals. Depreciation of capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of asset retirement obligations are recorded over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis,
while the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets. Asset retirement obligations have not been recognized for certain refinery, crude oil and product pipeline and marketing assets because the fair value cannot
be estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation.

Deferred taxes

— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their tax bases as reflected in Marathon’s filings with the respective taxing authority. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on several interrelated factors. These factors include
Marathon’s expectation to generate sufficient future taxable income including future foreign source income, tax credits, operating loss carryforwards, and management’s intent regarding the permanent reinvestment of the income from certain
foreign subsidiaries.

Pensions and other postretirement
benefits

— Marathon has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees, international employees located in Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and most MAP employees. In addition, several
excess benefits plans exist covering domestic employees within defined regulatory compensation limits. Benefits under these plans are based primarily upon years of service and final average pensionable earnings. MAP also participates in a
multiemployer plan that provides coverage for less than 5% of its employees. The benefits provided include both pension and health care.

Marathon also has defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance plans covering most employees upon their retirement. Health care benefits are provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major
medical benefit provisions or through health maintenance organizations, both subject to various cost sharing features. Amendments made to Marathon’s retiree health care plan, in the fourth quarter 2003, reduced the other postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $97 million (see Note 24). Life insurance benefits are provided to certain nonunion and union represented retiree beneficiaries. Other postretirement benefits have not been prefunded. Marathon uses a December 31
measurement date for its plans.

Stock-based compensation
—

The Marathon Oil Corporation 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Marathon to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, cash
awards and performance awards to employees. The Plan also allows Marathon to provide equity compensation to its non-employee directors of its Board of Directors. The Plan was approved by Marathon’s shareholders on April 30, 2003. No more than
20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the Plan, and no more than 8,500,000 of those shares may be used for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights. Shares subject to awards that are forfeited, terminated, expire
unexercised, settled in cash, exchanged for other awards, tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, withheld to satisfy tax obligations or otherwise lapse again become available for awards.

The Plan replaced the 1990 Stock Plan, the Non-Officer Restricted Stock Plan, the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, the deferred stock
benefit provision of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Senior Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, and the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, the “Prior Plans”). No new grants
will be made from the Prior Plans on or after April 30, 2003, with the exception of a maximum of 262,500 shares that may be required to be granted in order to fulfill the terms of officers’ performance-based restricted stock awards under the
1990 Plan. Any other awards previously granted under the Prior Plans shall continue to vest and/or be exercisable in accordance with their original terms and conditions.

F-11


Stock options represent the right to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value of
the stock on the date of grant. Certain options are granted with a tandem stock appreciation right, which allows the recipient to instead elect to receive cash and/or common stock equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of common
stock, as determined in accordance with the plan, over the option price of shares. Most stock options granted under the Plan vest ratably over a three-year period and all expire 10 years from the date they are granted.

The Compensation Committee grants stock-based Performance Awards to officers under the Plan. The stock-based Performance Awards represent
shares of common stock that are subject to forfeiture provisions and restrictions on transfer. Those restrictions may be removed if certain pre-established performance measures are met. The stock-based Performance Awards granted under the Plan
generally vest over a thirty-three month service period.

Marathon also grants restricted stock to certain non-officer
employees under the Plan. Participants are awarded restricted stock by the Salary and Benefits Committee based on their performance within certain guidelines. The restricted stock awards vest in one-third increments over a three-year period,
contingent upon the recipient’s continued employment. Prior to vesting, the restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock and receive dividends thereon. The nonvested shares are not transferable and are retained by Marathon
until they vest.

Unearned compensation is charged to equity when restricted stock and performance shares are granted.
Compensation expense is recognized over the balance of the vesting period and is adjusted if conditions of the restricted stock or performance share grant are not met. Amounts related to the performance-based restricted stock awards under the 1990
Plan are subsequently adjusted for changes in the market value of the underlying stock.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon
applied the fair value based method of accounting to future grants and any modified grants for stock-based compensation. All prior outstanding and unvested awards continue to be accounted for under the intrinsic value method. The following net
income and per share data illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

The above pro forma
amounts were based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which included the following information and assumptions:

Concentrations
of credit risk

– Marathon is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other
counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10% of annual revenues, Marathon has significant exposures to United States Steel
arising from the Separation. These exposures are discussed in Note 3.

Reclassifications

– Certain reclassifications of prior years’ data have been made to conform to 2003 classifications.

2. New Accounting Standards

Effective January
1, 2003, Marathon adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”). This statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Previous accounting
standards used the units-of-production method to match estimated future retirement costs with the revenues generated from the producing assets. In contrast, SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of
the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis over the life of the field, while the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically
as production declines.

For Marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas
producing facilities. While assets such as refineries, crude oil and product pipelines, and marketing assets have retirement obligations covered by SFAS No. 143, certain of those obligations are not recognized since the fair value cannot be
estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation.

The transition adjustment related to adopting
SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect on net income of adopting SFAS No. 143 was a net favorable effect of $4 million, net of tax of $4 million. At the time
of adoption, total assets increased $120 million, and total liabilities increased $116 million. The amounts recognized upon adoption are based upon numerous estimates and assumptions, including future retirement costs, future recoverable quantities
of oil and gas, future inflation rates and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Changes in asset retirement obligations during the year were:

(a)

Pro forma data as if SFAS No. 143 had been adopted on January 1, 2002. If adopted, income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for 2002 would have
been increased by $1 million and there would have been no impact on earnings per share.

(b)

Includes $12 million related to the acquisition of Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation in 2003.

(c)

Includes $25 million associated with assets sold in 2003.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS No. 145”). Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the provisions relating to the classification of the
effects of early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of income. As a result, losses of $53 million from the early extinguishment of debt in 2002, which were previously reported as an extraordinary item (net of tax of $20 million),
have been reclassified into income before income taxes. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 had no impact on net income for 2002.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 “Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS No. 146”). SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31, 2002. There were no impacts upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 146.

Effective
January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS No. 148”), an amendment of SFAS No. 123, provides alternative methods for the transition of the accounting for stock-based
compensation from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method. Marathon has applied the fair value method to grants made, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003. The impact on Marathon’s 2003 net income was not materially
different than under previous accounting standards.

The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” on April 30, 2003. The Statement is effective for derivative contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement did not have an effect on Marathon’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” on May 30, 2003. The adoption of this
Statement, effective July 1, 2003, did not have a material effect on Marathon’s financial position or results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”), requires the fair-value

F-13


measurement and recognition of a liability for the issuance or modification of certain guarantees. There were no cumulative effect adjustments necessary upon
the initial adoption of FIN 45. Enhanced disclosure requirements apply to both new and existing guarantees subject to FIN 45. See Note 28 for outstanding guarantees.

FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”), identifies certain off-balance
sheet arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that is exposed to the majority of the risks and/or returns of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to
consolidate the VIE. In addition, more extensive disclosure requirements apply to the primary beneficiary, as well as other significant investors. FIN 46R was effective immediately for VIE’s created after January 31, 2003. For special-purposes
entities (“SPEs”) created prior to February 1, 2003, FIN 46R is effective at the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003, or December 31, 2003 for Marathon. For non-SPE’s created prior to February 1,
2003, FIN 46R is effective for Marathon as of March 31, 2004. The adoption of this interpretation did not and is not expected to have any effect on Marathon’s financial statements.

The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Statement No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits”, effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. This statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in SFAS Statement No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits”, which it replaces, but requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit
postretirement plans. Certain required disclosures of information relating to foreign plans and estimated future benefit payments of all defined benefit plans have a delayed effective date for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Marathon has
elected earlier application of the entire disclosure provisions of this Statement.

On January 12, 2004, the FASB released
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“the Act”). Due to uncertainties as to the
effect of the provisions of the Act and certain accounting issues raised by the Act that are not addressed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions”, FSP 106-1 allows plan sponsors to elect a one-time deferral of the accounting for the Act. Marathon has elected to apply the one-time deferral until further guidance is provided by the FASB or the remeasurement of plan assets and
obligations occurs subsequent to January 31, 2004. Accordingly, any measures of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements and accompanying notes does not reflect the effects
of the Act on Marathon’s plans.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Abstract No. 02-16 “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor” (“EITF 02-16”), which requires rebates from vendors to be recorded as reductions to cost of
revenues. Restatement of prior year results is permitted but not required. Rebates from vendors of $159 million for 2003 are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. Rebates from vendors of $169 million and $149 million for 2002 and 2001 are
recorded in sales and other operating revenues. There was no effect on net income related to the adoption of EITF 02-16.

At
the May 2003 EITF meeting, a consensus was reached on EITF Abstract No. 01-8, “Determining Whether an Arrangement Is a Lease” (“EITF 01-8”). This guidance, under certain conditions, modifies the accounting for agreements that
historically have not been considered leases. EITF 01-8 is effective for all arrangements that are agreed upon, committed to, or modified after July 1, 2003. The adoption of EITF 01-08 did not have a material effect on Marathon’s financial
position or results of operations.

Since the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”), as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and 138, FASB has issued several interpretations. As a result, Marathon has recognized in income the effect of changes
in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2002, Marathon recognized a favorable cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $13 million, net of tax of $7 million.

3. Information about United States Steel

The Separation

– On December
31, 2001, in a tax-free distribution to holders of Steel Stock, Marathon exchanged the common stock of United States Steel for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis. The net assets of United States Steel at Separation were
approximately the same as the net assets attributable to Steel Stock immediately prior to the Separation, except for a value transfer of $900 million in the form of additional net debt and other financings retained by Marathon. During the last six
months of 2001, United States Steel completed a number of financings so that, upon Separation, the net debt and other financings of United States Steel as a separate legal entity would approximate the net debt and other financings attributable to
Steel Stock. At December 31, 2001, the net debt and other financings of United States Steel was $54 million less than the net debt and other financings attributable to the Steel Stock, adjusted for the value transfer and certain one-time items
related to the Separation. On February 6, 2002, United States Steel made a payment to Marathon of $54 million, plus applicable interest, to settle this difference.

F-14


In connection with the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel entered into a number
of agreements, including:

Financial Matters
Agreement

– Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a Financial Matters Agreement that provides for United States Steel’s assumption of certain industrial revenue bonds and certain other financial obligations of
Marathon. The Financial Matters Agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for Marathon’s discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial
revenue bonds.

Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under
the leases assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the
assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases.

United States Steel is the sole
general partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P. (Clairton 1314B), which owns certain cokemaking facilities formerly owned by United States Steel. Marathon has guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of United States Steel under the
partnership documents. The Financial Matters Agreement requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under this guarantee. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under
certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited partners
for certain income tax exposures.

The Financial Matters Agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts
to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment on the assumed obligations.

United States Steel’s obligations to Marathon under the Financial Matters Agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal
to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The Financial Matters Agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security
interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without Marathon’s consent.

Tax Sharing Agreement

– Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that reflects each party’s rights and obligations relating to payments and refunds of
income, sales, transfer and other taxes that are attributable to periods beginning prior to and including the Separation Date and taxes resulting from transactions effected in connection with the Separation.

The Tax Sharing Agreement incorporates the general tax sharing principles of the former tax allocation policy. In general, Marathon and
United States Steel, will make payments between them such that, with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Separation Date, the amount of taxes to be paid by
each of Marathon and United States Steel will be determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if the former groups each filed their own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return. The Tax Sharing Agreement also provides for payments between
Marathon and United States Steel for certain tax adjustments that may be made after the Separation. Other provisions address, but are not limited to, the handling of tax audits, settlements and return filing in cases where both Marathon and United
States Steel have an interest in the results of these activities.

A preliminary settlement for the calendar year 2001
federal income taxes, which would have been made in March 2002 under the former tax allocation policy, was made immediately prior to the Separation at a discounted amount to reflect the time value of money. Under the preliminary settlement for
calendar year 2001, United States Steel received approximately $440 million from Marathon immediately prior to Separation arising from the application of the tax allocation policy. This policy provided that United States Steel would receive the
benefit of tax attributes (principally net operating losses and various tax credits) that arose out of its business and which were used on a consolidated basis.

Additionally, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Marathon and United States Steel have agreed to protect the tax-free status of the
Separation. Marathon and United States Steel each covenant that during the two-year period following the Separation, it will not cease to be engaged in an active trade or business. Each party has represented that there is no plan or intention to
liquidate such party, take any other actions inconsistent with the information and representations set forth in the ruling request filed with the IRS or sell or otherwise dispose of its assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) during
the two-year period following the Separation. To the extent that a breach of a representation or covenant results in corporate tax being imposed, the breaching party, either Marathon or United States Steel, will be responsible for the payment of the
corporate tax.

In the fourth quarter 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, Marathon paid $16
million to United States Steel in connection with the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of USX Corporation for the years 1992 through 1994. Included in discontinued operations in 2003 is an
$8 million adjustment to the liabilities to United States Steel under this tax sharing agreement.

F-15


Relationship between Marathon and United States Steel after the
Separation

– As a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. Thomas J. Usher is chairman of the board of both companies, and as of
December 31, 2003, four of the ten remaining members of Marathon’s board of directors are also directors of United States Steel.

Sales to United States Steel in 2003 and 2002 were $31 million and $14 million, primarily for natural gas. Purchases from United States Steel in 2003 and 2002 were $14 million and $12 million, primarily for raw
materials. Management believes that transactions with United States Steel were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, Marathon cancelled the unvested restricted stock awards held by certain former officers and provided each with an appropriate cash settlement. The total cost of the settlement was $5
million.

Discontinued operations
presentation

– Marathon has accounted for the business of United States Steel as a discontinued operation. The loss from discontinued operations for the period ended December 31, 2001 includes the net loss attributable to
Steel Stock for the year, adjusted for corporate administrative expenses and interest expense (net of income tax effects) which may not be allocated to discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles and the loss on
disposition of United States Steel, which is the excess of the net investment in United States Steel over the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding shares of the Steel Stock at the time of the Separation. Because operating and investing
activities are separately identifiable to each of Marathon and United States Steel, such amounts have been separately disclosed in the statement of cash flows. Financing activities were managed on a centralized, consolidated basis. Therefore they
have been reflected on a consolidated basis in the statement of cash flows.

Transactions related to invested cash, debt and
related interest and other financing costs, and preferred stock and related dividends were attributed to discontinued operations based on the cash flows of United States Steel for the periods presented and the initial capital structure attributable
to Steel Stock. However, certain limitations on the amount of interest expense allocated to discontinued operations are required by generally accepted accounting principles. Corporate general and administrative costs were allocated to discontinued
operations based upon utilization. Other corporate general and administrative costs attributable to Steel Stock that were allocated using methods which considered certain measures of business activities, such as employment, investments and revenues,
are not permitted to be classified as discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles. Income taxes were allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with Marathon’s tax allocation policy. In general, such policy
provided that the consolidated tax provision and related tax payments or refunds were allocated to discontinued operations based principally upon the financial income, taxable income, credits, preferences and other amounts directly related to United
States Steel.

The results of operations of United States Steel, subject to the limitations described above, have been
reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are summarized as follows:

The computation of
the loss on disposition of United States Steel on December 31, 2001 was as follows:

Amounts
receivable from or payable to United States Steel arising from the Separation

– As previously discussed, Marathon remains primarily obligated for certain financings for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for
repayment under the terms of the Separation. When United States Steel makes payments on the principal of these financings, both the receivable and the obligation will be reduced.

F-16


At December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounts receivable or payable to United States Steel were
included in the balance sheet as follows:

(a)

Increase is due to the extension of an operating lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Clairton Works cokemaking facility which is now accounted for as a
capital lease.

Marathon remains
primarily obligated for $72 million of operating lease obligations assumed by United States Steel, of which $54 million has in turn been assumed by other third parties that had purchased plants and operations divested by United States Steel.

In addition, Marathon remains contingently liable for certain obligations of United States Steel. See Note 28 for
additional details on these guarantees.

4. Related Party Transactions

Related parties
include:

•

Ashland Inc. (Ashland), which holds a 38 percent ownership interest in MAP, a consolidated subsidiary.

•

Equity method investees.

Management believes that
transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.

Revenues from related parties were as follows:

Related party sales to
Ashland and PTC consist primarily of petroleum products.

Purchases from related parties were as follows:

Receivables from related parties were as follows:

F-17


Payables to related parties were as follows:

MAP
has a $190 million uncommitted revolving credit agreement with Ashland. Interest on borrowings is based on defined short-term borrowing rates. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no borrowings against this facility. Interest paid to Ashland
for borrowings under this agreement was less than $1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001.

5. Business Combinations

On May 12, 2003, Marathon acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation (“KMOC”) for $285 million, including the assumption of $31 million in debt.
KMOC is currently developing nine oil fields in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of western Siberia in the Russian Federation. Results of operations for 2003 include the results of KMOC from May 12, 2003. The allocation of purchase price is preliminary,
pending the finalization of certain contingencies. There was no goodwill associated with the purchase.

The following table
summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

During 2002, in two separate transactions, Marathon acquired interests in the Alba Field offshore Equatorial Guinea, West Africa, and certain other related assets.

On January 3, 2002, Marathon acquired certain interests from CMS Energy Corporation for $1.005 billion. Marathon acquired three entities
that own a combined 52.4% working interest in the Alba Production Sharing Contract and a net 43.2% interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant through an equity method investee. Additionally, Marathon acquired a 45.0% net
interest in an onshore methanol production plant through an equity method investee. Results of operations for 2002 include the results of the interests acquired from CMS Energy from January 3, 2002.

On June 20, 2002, Marathon acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Globex Energy, Inc. (“Globex”) for $155 million. Globex
owned an additional 10.9% working interest in the Alba Production Sharing Contract and an additional net 9.0% interest in the onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. Globex also held oil and gas interests offshore Australia, which were
sold on October 28, 2003. Results of operations include the results of the interests acquired from Globex from June 20, 2002.

The CMS and Globex allocations of purchase price are final. The goodwill arising from the allocations was $175 million, which was assigned to the E&P segment. Significant factors that resulted in the recognition of goodwill include: the
ability to acquire an established business with an assembled workforce and a proven track record and a strategic acquisition in a core geographic area.

Additionally, the purchase price allocated to equity method investments was $224 million higher than the underlying net assets of the investees. This excess will be amortized over the expected useful life of the
underlying assets except for $81 million of goodwill relating to equity method investments.

F-18


The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisitions:

In
the first quarter 2001, Marathon acquired Pennaco Energy, Inc. (Pennaco), a natural gas producer. Marathon acquired 87% of the outstanding stock of Pennaco through a tender offer completed on February 7, 2001 at $19 a share. On March 26, 2001,
Pennaco was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon. Under the terms of the merger, each share not held by Marathon was converted into the right to receive $19 in cash. The total cash purchase price of Pennaco was $506 million. The
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The goodwill totaled $70 million. Goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” on January 1, 2002. Results of operations for 2001 include the results of Pennaco from February 7, 2001.

The
following unaudited pro forma data for Marathon includes the results of operations of the above acquisitions giving effect to them as if they had been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma data is based on historical
information and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Included in the amounts for 2002 are approximately $3 million (net of tax of $2 million) or
$0.01 per share of nonrecurring legal and employee benefit costs incurred by Globex related to the acquisition.

6. Discontinued Operations

On October 1, 2003,
Marathon sold its exploration and production operations in western Canada for $612 million. This divestiture decision was made as part of Marathon’s strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties. The results of these operations
have been reported separately as discontinued operations in Marathon’s Consolidated Statement of Income. The sale resulted in a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million, which has been reported in discontinued operations.
Revenues applicable to the discontinued operations totaled $188 million, $165 and $60 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Pretax income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $66 million, $(4) million and $(155) million for 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 3 for discontinued operations related to the separation of United States Steel.

The following represents information by operating segment:

(a)

Management believes intersegment transactions and transactions with United States Steel were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.

(b)

Excludes a $124 million loss on the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P., which was not allocated to segments. See Note 13.

(c)

Differences between segment totals and Marathon totals represent impairments and amounts related to corporate administrative activities.

(d)

Excludes impairments of undeveloped oil and gas properties.

Excludes $34 million and $28 million paid by United States Steel in 2003 and 2002 on assumed debt.

Foreign currency transactions

Aggregate foreign currency gains (losses) were included in
the income statement as follows:

F-22


10. Income Taxes

Provisions (credits) for
income taxes were:

A
reconciliation of federal statutory tax rate (35%) to total provisions follows:

(a)

Represents a one-time deferred tax charge as a result of the enactment of a supplemental tax in the United Kingdom.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from the
following:

(a)

Includes $450 million for Norway which has no expiration date. The remainder expire 2004 through 2008.

(b)

Marathon expects to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets. In addition, the ability to realize the benefit of
foreign tax credits is based upon certain assumptions concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices), income generated from foreign sources and Marathon’s tax profile in the years that such credits may
be claimed.

F-23


Net deferred tax liabilities were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as
follows:

The
consolidated tax returns of Marathon for the years 1995 through 2001 are under various stages of audit and administrative review by the IRS. Marathon believes it has made adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may become payable for
years not yet settled.

Pretax income from continuing operations included $453 million, $372 million and $257 million
attributable to foreign sources in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Undistributed income of certain consolidated foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2003, amounted to $450 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because Marathon intends to permanently reinvest such income in those foreign operations. If such income
were not permanently reinvested, a deferred tax liability of $158 million would have been required.

See Note 3 for a
discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement between Marathon and United States Steel.

11. Business Transformation

During the third quarter of 2003, Marathon implemented an organizational realignment plan and business process improvements to further enable Marathon to
focus and execute on its core business strategies by providing superior long-term value growth. This program includes streamlining Marathon’s business processes and services, realigning reporting relationships to reduce costs across all
organizations, consolidating organizations in Houston and reducing the workforce.

During 2003, Marathon recorded $24
million of business transformation related costs against earnings, including $22 million in general and administrative expense and $2 million loss on assets held for sale. These charges included employee severance and benefit costs related to the
elimination of approximately 400 regular employees, the majority of which were engaged in operations around the United States, relocation costs related to consolidating organizations in Houston, a pension curtailment loss, a postretirement plan
curtailment gain, and fixed asset related costs.

The table below sets forth the significant components and activity in the
business transformation program during 2003:

An
additional charge of $51 million is expected to be incurred in 2004, including $34 million related to pension settlement.

12. Inventories

The
LIFO method accounted for 91% and 92% of total inventory value at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Current acquisition costs were estimated to exceed the above inventory values at December 31, 2003, by approximately $655 million. Cost of
revenues was reduced and income from operations was increased by $11 million in 2003, less than $1 million in 2002, and $17 million in 2001 as a result of liquidations of LIFO inventories.

F-24


13. Investments and Long-Term Receivables

Summarized financial information of investees accounted for by the equity method of accounting follows:

Marathon’s carrying value of its equity method investments is $96 million higher than the underlying net assets of investees. This basis difference is being amortized into expenses over the remaining useful lives of the underlying net
assets.

Dividends and partnership distributions received from equity investees were $188 million in 2003, $114 million in
2002 and $95 million in 2001.

On June 30, 2003, Marathon Oil Corporation and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.
(“Kinder Morgan”) dissolved MKM Partners L.P. which had oil and gas production operations in the Permian Basin of Texas. Marathon held an 85% noncontrolling interest in the partnership. Prior to the dissolution of the partnership, Kinder
Morgan acquired MKM Partners L.P.’s 12.75% interest in the SACROC unit for an undisclosed amount. The partnership recorded a loss on the disposal of SACROC of $19 million, of which Marathon’s share was $17 million. Also prior to the
dissolution, Marathon recorded a $107 million impairment of its investment in MKM Partners L.P. due to an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investment. The total loss recognized by Marathon related to the dissolution of MKM
Partners L.P. was $124 million. The partnership’s interest in the Yates field was distributed to Marathon and Kinder Morgan upon dissolution.

14. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes gross assets acquired under capital leases of $49 million and $8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, with related amounts in accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization of $2 million and $1
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

On November 3, 2003, Marathon sold its 42.45% interest in the Yates field and its
100% interest in the Yates gathering system to Kinder Morgan for $229 million and recognized a loss of $8 million. This divestiture decision was made as part of Marathon’s strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties. The Yates
field and gathering system consisted of assets of $240 million of property, plant and equipment and asset retirement obligations of $3 million.

F-25


During 2002, Marathon acquired additional interests in coalbed natural gas assets in the
Powder River Basin of northern Wyoming and southern Montana from XTO Energy, Inc. (XTO) in exchange for certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. Additionally, 100 million cubic feet per day of long-term gas
transportation capacity was released to Marathon by the original owner of the Powder River Basin interests. On July 1, 2002, Marathon completed this transaction by selling its production interests in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico to XTO for $42
million. Marathon recognized a gain of $24 million in 2002 related to this transaction.

15. Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, are as follows:

The
E&P segment tests for impairment in the second quarter of each year. The RM&T segment tests for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. No impairment in the carrying value has been deemed necessary.

16. Intangible Assets

Intangible assets as of December 31, 2003, are as follows:

Amortization expense related to intangibles during 2003 and 2002 totaled $12 million and $10 million, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the years 2004-2008 is $12 million, $11 million, $11 million, $7 million and $5 million,
respectively.

F-26


17. Derivative Instruments

The following table sets forth quantitative information by category of
derivative instrument at December 31, 2003 and 2002. These amounts are reflected on a gross basis by individual derivative instrument. The amounts exclude the variable margin deposit balances held in various brokerage accounts. Marathon did not have
any foreign currency contracts in place at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

(a)

The fair value and carrying value of derivative instruments are the same. The fair value amounts for OTC positions are determined using option-pricing models or dealer
quotes. The fair values of exhange-traded positions are based on market quotes derived from major exchanges. The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes. Marathon’s consolidated balance sheet is reflected on a net
asset/(liability) basis by brokerage firm, as permitted by the master netting agreements.

(b)

There was no ineffectiveness associated with fair value hedges for 2003 or 2002 because the hedging instrument and the existing firm commitment contracts are priced on
the same underlying index. Certain derivative instruments used in the fair value hedges mature between 2004 and 2008.

(c)

The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value for cash flow hedges, on a before tax basis, for December 31, 2003 and 2002 was less than $1 million. In addition,
during 2003 and 2002, losses of $8 million and gains of $23 million was recognized in revenues, respectively, as the result of a discontinuation of a portion of a cash flow hedge related to natural gas production. Of the $15 million recorded in OCI
as of December 31, 2003, $17 million is expected to be reclassified to income in 2004.

(d)

Nontraditional derivative instruments are created due to netting of physical receipts and delivery volumes with the same counterparty. Also included in this category are
long-term natural gas contracts in the United Kingdom in which underlying physical contract price is currently less than other available market prices.

(e)

The fair value amounts are based on dealer quotes. These fair value amounts exclude accrued interest amounts not yet settled. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, accrued
interest approximated $7 million and $1 million respectively. The net fair value of the OTC interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $4 million and $12 million respectively, is included in long-term debt (see Note 20).

F-27


18. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily
representative of the amount that could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax consequences of realization or settlement. The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding derivative financial
instruments disclosed in Note 17, by individual balance sheet account. Marathon’s financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were:

Fair
value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities approximates carrying value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of investments and long-term receivables was based on discounted cash flows or other
specific instrument analysis. Fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where available or current borrowing rates available for financings with similar terms and maturities. Fair value of the receivables from United States
Steel were estimated using market prices for United States Steel debt assuming the industrial revenue bonds are redeemed on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation per the Financial Matters Agreement.

Marathon has a commitment to extend credit to Syntroleum Corporation (Syntroleum) that is described further in Note 28. It is not
practicable to estimate the fair value because there are no quoted market prices available for transactions that are similar in nature.

19. Short-Term Debt

In November 2003, Marathon entered into a $575 million 364-day revolving credit agreement, which terminates in November 2004. Interest is based on defined
short-term market rates. During the term of the agreement, Marathon is obligated to pay a facility fee on total commitments, which at December 31, 2003, was 0.10%. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against this facility. Marathon has
other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, bearing interest at short-term market rates determined at the time of a request for borrowings against such facility. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against these
facilities.

MAP has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with Ashland Inc. that terminates in March 2004, as discussed
in Note 4. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against this facility.

F-28


20. Long-Term Debt

(a)

Marathon has a $1,354 million 5-year revolving credit agreement that terminates in November 2005. Interest on the facility is based on defined short-term market rates.
During the term of the agreement, Marathon is obligated to pay a variable facility fee on total commitments, which at December 31, 2003 was 0.125%. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against this facility. Commercial paper is supported
by the unused and available credit on the 5-year facility and, accordingly, is classified as long-term debt.

(b)

These notes contain a make whole provision allowing Marathon the right to repay the debt at a premium to market price.

(c)

United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment of $470 million of these obligations.

(d)

This sale-leaseback financing arrangement relates to a lease of a slab caster at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility in Alabama with a term through 2012.
Marathon is the primary obligor under this lease. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has assumed responsibility for all obligations under this lease. This lease is an amortizing financing with a final maturity of 2012,
subject to additional extensions.

(e)

This obligation relates to a lease of equipment at United States Steel’s Clairton Works cokemaking facility in Pennsylvania with a term through 2012. Marathon is the
primary obligor under this lease. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has assumed responsibility for all obligations under this lease. This lease is an amortizing financing with a final maturity of 2012, subject to additional
extensions. This equipment has been subleased to Clairton 1314B, L.P. through July 2, 2004.

(f)

Required payments of long-term debt for the years 2005-2008 are $16 million, $315 million, $474 million and $417 million, respectively. Of these amounts, payments assumed
by United States Steel are $7 million, $11 million, $21 million and $14 million, respectively.

(g)

In the event of a change in control of Marathon, as defined in the related agreements, debt obligations totaling $1,837 million at December 31, 2003, may be declared
immediately due and payable.

(h)

See Note 17 for information on interest rate swaps.

F-29


21. Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities

Deferred credits and other liabilities included the following:

22. Preferred Securities Formerly Outstanding

USX Capital LLC, a former wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon, had sold 10,000,000 shares (carrying value of $250 million) of 8


/4% Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred Shares (MIPS) (liquidation preference of $25 per share) in 1994. On December 31, 2001, USX Capital LLC called for redemption all of the outstanding MIPS. In December 2001, $27 million
of MIPS were exchanged for debt securities of United States Steel. At the redemption date, USX Capital LLC paid $25.18 per share reflecting the redemption price of $25 per share, plus a cash payment for accrued but unpaid dividends through the
redemption date. After the redemption date, the MIPS ceased to accrue dividends and only represented the right to receive the redemption price.

In 1997, Marathon exchanged approximately 3.9 million, $50 face value, 6.75% Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities of USX Capital Trust I (QUIPS), a Delaware statutory business trust, for an equivalent
number of shares of its 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (6.50% Preferred Stock). In December 2001, $12 million of QUIPS were exchanged for debt securities of United States Steel. At the time of Separation, all outstanding QUIPS became
redeemable at their face value plus accrued but unpaid distributions. The QUIPS were included in the net investment in United States Steel. In early January 2002, Marathon paid $185 million to retire the QUIPS.

Marathon had issued 6.50% Preferred Stock and prior to the Separation, had 2,209,042 shares (stated value of $1.00 per share; liquidation
preference of $50.00 per share) outstanding. In December 2001, $10 million of 6.50% Preferred Stock were exchanged for debt securities of United States Steel. At the time of Separation, all outstanding shares of the 6.50% Preferred Stock were
converted into the right to receive $50.00 in cash. In early January 2002, Marathon paid $110 million to retire the 6.50% Preferred Stock.

In 1998, in conjunction with the acquisition of Tarragon Oil and Gas Limited, Marathon issued 878,074 Exchangeable Shares, which were exchangeable solely on a one-for-one basis into Common Stock. Holders of
Exchangeable Shares were entitled to receive dividend payments equivalent to dividends declared on Common Stock. The Exchangeable Shares were exchangeable at any time at the option of holder, could be called for early redemption under certain
circumstances and were automatically redeemable on August 11, 2003. The remaining outstanding Exchangeable Shares were redeemed early in exchange for Common Stock on August 11, 2001.

Plan Assumptions

Expected Long-Term
Return on Plan Assets

U.S. Plans

Historical markets are studied and long-term historical
relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Certain components of the asset mix are
modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

International Plans

The overall expected long-term return on plan assets is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns on the different asset
classes, weighted by holdings as of year end. The long term rate of return on equity investments is assumed to be 2.5% greater than the yield on local government stock. Expected returns on debt securities are taken directly at market yields and cash
is taken at the local currency base rate.

Assumed health care
cost trend rates at December 31:

Assumed health care
cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

F-34


Plan Assets

The pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at December 2003 and 2002, by asset category are as
follows:

Plan Investment
Policies and Strategies

U.S. Plans

The investment policy reflects the funded status of the plan
and the future ability of the Company to make further contributions. Historical performance results and future expectations suggest that common stocks will provide higher total investment returns than fixed-income securities over a long-term
investment horizon. As a result, equity investments will likely continue to exceed 50% of the value of the fund. Accordingly, bond and other fixed income investments will comprise the remainder of the fund. Short term investments shall reflect the
liquidity requirements for making pension payments. Management of the plans’ assets is delegated to the United States Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund. Investments are diversified by industry and type, limited by grade and maturity. The policy
prohibits investments in any securities in the steel industry and allows derivatives subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset
and liability studies.

International Plans

The investment policy is guided by the objective of
achieving over the long-term a return on the investments which is consistent with assumptions made by the actuary in determining the funding requirements of the plans. The target asset allocation of 70% equities, 25% debt securities and 5% cash and
the unitized pool approach meets this objective and controls and various risks to which the plans’ assets are exposed including matching the timing of estimated future obligations to the maturities of the plans’ assets. The day-to-day
management of the plans’ assets are delegated to several professional investment managers. The spread of assets by type and the investment managers’ policies on investing in individual securities within each type provides adequate
diversification of investments. The use of derivatives by the investment managers is permitted and plan specific, subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly
investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies.

Cash Flows

Contributions

MAP, and Marathon’s foreign
subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $93 million and $22 million to the funded pension plans in 2004. Marathon is not required to make a cash contribution to the funded domestic pension plan in 2004. Cash contributions that are expected
to be paid from the general assets of the company for both the unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans are expected to be approximately $2 million and $35 million, respectively in 2004.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected
future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

(a)

Excludes the potential payments relating to business transformation.

Marathon also contributes to several defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Contributions to these plans, which for the most

Marathon maintains an equity compensation program for its non-employee directors under
the Plan. Pursuant to the program, non-employee directors must defer 50% of their annual retainers in the form of common stock units. In addition, the program provides each non-employee director with a matching grant of up to 1,000 shares of common
stock upon his or her initial election to the board if he or she purchases an equivalent number of shares within 60 days of joining the board. Common stock units are book entry units equal in value to a share of stock. During 2003, 15,799 shares of
stock were issued; during 2002, 14,472 shares of stock were issued and during 2001, 12,358 shares of stock were issued.

26. Stockholder Rights Plan

In 2002, the Marathon’s stockholder rights plan (the Rights Plan), was amended due to the Separation. In January 2003, the expiration date of the
Rights Plan was accelerated to January 31, 2003.

27. Leases

Marathon leases a wide
variety of facilities and equipment under operating leases, including land and building space, office equipment, production facilities and transportation equipment. Most long-term leases include renewal options and, in certain leases, purchase
options. Future minimum commitments for capital lease obligations (including sale-leasebacks accounted for as financings) and for operating lease obligations having remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:

In
connection with past sales of various plants and operations, Marathon assigned and the purchasers assumed certain leases of major equipment used in the divested plants and operations of United States Steel. In the event of a default by any of the
purchasers, United States Steel has assumed these obligations; however, Marathon remains primarily obligated for payments under these leases. Minimum lease payments under these operating lease obligations of $54 million have been included above and
an equal amount has been reported as sublease rentals.

Of the $181 million present value of net minimum capital lease
payments, $135 million was related to obligations assumed by United States Steel under the Financial Matters Agreement. Of the $378 million total minimum operating lease payments, $18 million was assumed by United States Steel under the Financial
Matters Agreement.

During 2003, Marathon purchased two LNG tankers to transport LNG primarily from Kenai, Alaska to Tokyo,
Japan which were previously leased. A $17 million charge was recorded on the termination of the two tanker operating leases.

Operating lease rental expense was:

F-37


28. Contingencies and Commitments

Marathon is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or threatened
legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to Marathon’s consolidated financial statements. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
unfavorably.

Environmental matters

–
Marathon is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation
of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $117 million and $84 million, respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the
ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain states, under programs to assist companies in cleanup efforts related to underground storage tanks
at retail marketing outlets, were $86 million and $72 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

On May 11, 2001,
MAP entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which commits it to complete certain agreed upon environmental projects over an eight-year period primarily aimed at reducing air emissions at its seven refineries. The
court approved this consent decree on August 28, 2001. The total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $330 million over the eight-year period, with about $170 million incurred through December 31, 2003. In
addition, MAP has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged Clean Air Act violations, at a cost of $9 million. MAP believes that this settlement will
provide MAP with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions.

Guarantees

– Marathon and MAP have issued the following guarantees:

(a)

Marathon holds interests in an offshore oil port, LOOP LLC (“LOOP”), and a crude oil pipeline system, LOCAP LLC (“LOCAP”). Both LOOP and LOCAP
have secured various project financings with throughput and deficiency (“T&D”) agreements. A T&D agreement creates a potential obligation to advance funds in the event of a cash shortfall. When these rights are assigned to a lender
to secure financing, the T&D is considered to be an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. Under the agreements, Marathon is required to advance funds if the investees are unable to service debt. Any such advances are considered prepayments of
future transportation charges. The terms of the agreements vary but tend to follow the terms of the underlying debt. In April 2003, LOOP refinanced $81 million for certain of its series of outstanding bonds subject to these T&D agreements. The
refinancing consisted of changes to maturity dates, as well as interest rates. Although certain series were paid down and new series issued, the total principal outstanding changed by only $2 million. Assuming non-payment by the investees, the
maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is estimated to be $193 million and $197

F-38


million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in these amounts is a LOOP revolving credit facility of $25 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, and a LOCAP revolving credit facility of $20 million and $25 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The undrawn portion of the revolving credit facilities is $35 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(b)

MAP holds an interest in a refined products pipeline, Centennial Pipeline LLC (“Centennial”), and has guaranteed the repayment of Centennial’s outstanding
balance under a Master Shelf Agreement and Revolver, which expires in 2024. The guarantee arose in order to obtain adequate financing. Prior to expiration of the guarantee, MAP could be relinquished from responsibility under the guarantee should
Centennial meet certain financial tests. If Centennial defaults on its outstanding balance, the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments is $75 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

(c)

Marathon has guaranteed United States Steel’s contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent-owned joint venture, PRO-TEC Coating Company
(“PRO-TEC”). Should PRO-TEC default under its agreements and should United States Steel be unable to perform under its guarantee, Marathon is required to perform on behalf of United States Steel. The maximum potential payout is estimated
at $14 million and $18 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, United States Steel is the sole general partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P., which owns certain cokemaking facilities formerly owned by United States
Steel. Marathon has guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of United States Steel under the partnership documents. In addition to the commitment to fund operating cash shortfalls of the partnership discussed in Note 3, United States
Steel, under certain circumstances, is required to indemnify the limited partners if the partnership product sales fail to qualify for the credit under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. United States Steel has estimated the maximum potential
amount of this indemnity obligation at December 31, 2003, including interest and tax gross-up, is approximately $610 million. Furthermore, United States Steel under certain circumstances has indemnified the partnership for environmental obligations.
The maximum potential amount of this indemnity obligation is not estimable.

(d)

The agreement between Centennial and its members allows each member to contribute cash in lieu of Centennial procuring separate insurance in the event of third-party
liability arising from a catastrophic event. There is an indefinite term for the agreement and each member is to contribute cash in proportion to its ownership interest, up to a maximum amount of $50 million and $33 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. In February 2003, Marathon’s ownership interest in Centennial increased from 33% to 50%. As a result of this modification to the Centennial catastrophic event guarantee, MAP recorded a $4 million obligation during 2003.

(e)

Marathon is a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline L.P. (“Alliance”). The agreement requires Marathon to pay minimum
annual charges of approximately $5 million through 2015. The payments are required even if the transportation facility is not utilized. As this contract has been used by Alliance to secure its financing, the arrangement qualifies as an indirect
guarantee of indebtedness. This agreement runs through 2015 and has a maximum potential payout of $67 million and $70 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a result of the Canadian sale discussed below, Husky Oil Operations Limited
(“Husky”) has indemnified Marathon for any claims related to these guarantees.

(f)

Kenai Kachemak Pipeline LLC (“KKPL”) was organized in late 2002. Marathon is an equity investor in KKPL, holding a 60%, noncontrolling interest. In April 2003,
Marathon guaranteed KKPL’s performance to properly construct, operate, maintain and abandon the pipeline in accordance with the Alaska Pipeline Act and the Right of Way Lease Agreement with the State of Alaska. The major obligations covered
under the guarantee include maintaining the right-of-way, satisfying any liabilities caused by operation of the pipeline, and providing for the abandonment costs. Obligations that could arise under the guarantee would vary according to the
circumstances triggering payment but the maximum potential payment is estimated at $15 million at Dec. 31, 2003.

(g)

Marathon has engaged in a general agreement of indemnity with a surety bond provider for the execution of all surety bonds and has executed certain of these bonds on
behalf of Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”). In the event of a demand on a bond by an obligee, Marathon is required to repay the surety bond provider. The bonds issued have been placed mainly for tax liability, licenses for liquor and
lottery, workers’ compensation self-insurance, utility services, and for underground storage tank financial responsibility. Most surety bonds carry a one-year term, renewable annually, though a few bonds are for longer than a year. Accordingly,
the maximum potential payment associated with these bonds continues to decrease as more bonds are cancelled and replaced with PTC’s own surety bond provider. Should Marathon have to pay any amounts under the remaining surety bonds, the PTC LLC
agreement provides that each partner will bear their proportionate share of any amounts paid. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the maximum potential amount of future payment under the guarantee is estimated to be $10 million and $43 million,
respectively.

(h)

Marathon provides a guarantee of the residual value of certain leased corporate assets.

(i)

In conjunction with the sale of certain Canadian assets to Husky during 2003, Marathon guaranteed Husky with regards to unknown environmental obligations and inaccuracies
in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements by Marathon. These indemnifications are part of the normal course of doing business and selling assets. Per the Purchase and Sale agreement, the maximum potential amount of future payments
associated with these guarantees is $568 million.

(j)

During 2003 Marathon also sold certain assets associated with its interest in Globex Far East Pty, Ltd. Marathon indemnified the purchaser from unknown environmental
liabilities and inaccuracies by Marathon in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees of $16 million is specified in the Purchase and Sale agreement. The term of this
guarantee is three years.

(k)

As discussed in Note 14, Marathon sold its interest in the Yates field and gathering system to Kinder Morgan. In accordance with this transaction, Marathon indemnified
Kinder Morgan from inaccuracies in Marathon’s representations, warranties, covenants and agreement. There is not a specified term on these guarantees and the maximum potential amount of future cash payments is estimated at $228 million.

(l)

These leases contain terminal rental adjustment clauses which provide that MAP will indemnify the lessor to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the asset at the end of the
lease falls short of the specified minimum percent of original value.

(m)

$325 million represents guarantees made by MAP and $35 million represents the undrawn portion of revolving credit facilities.

F-39


Contract commitments

– At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Marathon’s contract
commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled $565 million and $443 million, respectively.

Commitments to extend credit

– In May 2002, Marathon signed a Participation Agreement with Syntroleum in connection with the
ultra-clean fuels production and demonstration project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. In connection with this project, Marathon agreed to provide funding pursuant to a $21 million secured promissory note between Marathon and Syntroleum.
The promissory note will bear interest at a rate of 8% per year. The promissory note is secured by a mortgage and security agreement in the assets of the project. In the event of a default by Syntroleum, the mortgage and security agreement provides
Marathon access for project completion. As of December 31, 2003, Marathon had advanced Syntroleum $21 million under this commitment.

Put/call agreements

–

In connection with the 1998 formation of MAP, Marathon and Ashland entered into a Put/Call, Registration
Rights and Standstill Agreement (the Put/Call Agreement). The Put/Call Agreement provides that at any time after December 31, 2004, Ashland will have the right to sell to Marathon all of Ashland’s ownership interest in MAP, for an amount in
cash and/or Marathon debt or equity securities equal to the product of 85% (90% if equity securities are used) of the fair market value of MAP at that time, multiplied by Ashland’s percentage interest in MAP. Payment could be made at closing,
or at Marathon’s option, in three equal annual installments, the first of which would be payable at closing. At any time after December 31, 2004, Marathon will have the right to purchase all of Ashland’s ownership interests in MAP, for an
amount in cash equal to the product of 115% of the fair market value of MAP at that time, multiplied by Ashland’s percentage interest in MAP.

As part of the formation of PTC, MAP and Pilot Corporation (Pilot) entered into a Put/Call and Registration Rights Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement provides that any time after September 1, 2008, Pilot will have
the right to sell its interest in PTC to MAP for an amount of cash and/or Marathon, MAP or Ashland equity securities equal to the product of 90% (95% if paid in securities) of the fair market value of PTC at the time multiplied by Pilot’s
percentage interest in PTC. At any time after September 1, 2011, under certain conditions, MAP will have the right to purchase Pilot’s interest in PTC for an amount of cash and/or Marathon, MAP or Ashland equity securities equal to the product
of 105% (110% if paid in securities) of the fair market value of PTC at the time multiplied by Pilot’s percentage interest in PTC.

29. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

An issue currently on the EITF agenda, Issue No. 03-S “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, to Oil
and Gas Companies,” will address how oil and gas companies should classify the costs of acquiring contractual mineral interests in oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. The EITF is considering an alternative interpretation of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” that mineral or drilling rights or leases, concessions or other interests representing the right to extract oil or gas should be classified as intangible
assets rather than oil and gas properties. Management believes that our current balance sheet classification for these costs is appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. If a reclassification is ultimately required, the estimated
amount of the leasehold acquisition costs to be reclassified would be $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Should such a change be required, there would be no impact on our previously filed income statements (or reported net
income), statements of cash flow or statements of stockholders’ equity for prior periods. Additional disclosures related to intangible assets would also be required.

Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Marathon’s estimated net proved liquid hydrocarbon (oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids) and gas reserves and the changes thereto for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 are shown in the following tables. Estimates of the proved
reserves have been prepared by internal asset teams including reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals, except the estimated proved gas reserves for the U.S. Powder River Basin that are estimated by the independent petroleum consultants of
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. Reserve estimates are periodically reviewed by the Corporate Reserves Group to assure that rigorous professional standards and the reserves definitions prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) are consistently applied throughout the company.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are subject to changes, either positively or negatively, as
additional information becomes available and contractual, economic and political conditions change.

Marathon’s net proved reserve
estimates have been adjusted as necessary to reflect all contractual agreements, royalty obligations and interests owned by others at the time of the estimate. Only reserves that are estimated to be recovered during the term of the current contract,
unless there is a clear and consistent history of contract extension, have been included in the proved reserve estimate. Reserves from properties governed by Production Sharing Contracts have been calculated using the “economic interest”
method prescribed by the SEC. Reserves that are not currently considered proved, that may result from extensions of currently proved areas, or that may result from applying secondary or tertiary recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be
economic, are excluded. Purchased natural gas utilized in reservoir management and subsequently resold is also excluded. Marathon does not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves subject to long-term supply agreements with foreign governments or
authorities in which Marathon acts as producer.

Proved developed reserves are the quantities of oil and gas expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. In some cases, proved undeveloped reserves may require substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities. Production volumes shown are sales volumes, net of
any products consumed during production activities.

(a)

Consists of estimated reserves from properties governed by production sharing contracts.

(b)

The net positive or negative balance of proved reserves acquired or relinquished in property trades within the same geographic area is reported within purchases of
reserves in place or sales of reserves in place, respectively.

(c)

Reserves represent the contribution of certain mineral interests to MKM Partners L.P., a joint venture accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes therein were
determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69. Certain information concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of proved reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed below. Marathon believes
such information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.

Future cash inflows

are computed by
applying year-end prices of oil and gas relating to Marathon’s proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.

The assumptions used to compute the proved reserve valuation do not necessarily reflect Marathon’s expectations of actual revenues to
be derived from those reserves or their present worth. Assigning monetary values to the estimated quantities of reserves, described on the preceding page, does not reduce the subjective and ever-changing nature of such reserve estimates.

Additional subjectivity occurs when determining present values because the rate of producing the reserves must be estimated. In addition to
uncertainties inherent in predicting the future, variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of Marathon’s control, such as unintentional delays in development, environmental
concerns, changes in prices or regulatory controls.

The reserve valuation assumes that all reserves will be disposed of by production.
However, if reserves are sold in place or subjected to participation by foreign governments, additional economic considerations also could affect the amount of cash eventually realized.

Future development and production, transportation and administrative costs

are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing
and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.

Future income tax expenses

are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to
Marathon’s proved oil and gas reserves. Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are recognized.

Discount

was derived by using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.
