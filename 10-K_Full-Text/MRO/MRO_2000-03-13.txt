NOTE ON PRESENTATION

       USX Corporation ("USX" or the "Corporation") is a diversified company
principally engaged in the energy business through its Marathon Group and in
the steel business through its U. S. Steel Group. USX has two classes of
common stock, USX - Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock") and USX
- - U. S. Steel Group Common Stock ("Steel Stock"). Each class of Common Stock
is intended to provide stockholders of that class with a separate security
reflecting the performance of the related group.

       Effective October 31, 1997, USX sold Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation
and other subsidiaries of USX that comprised all of the USX - Delhi Group
("Delhi Companies"). On January 26, 1998, USX used the $195 million net
proceeds from the sale to redeem all of the 9.45 million outstanding shares
of USX-Delhi Group Common Stock.

       USX continues to include consolidated financial information in its
periodic reports required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in its
annual shareholder reports and in other financial communications. The
consolidated financial statements are supplemented with separate financial
statements of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group, together with the
related Management's Discussion and Analyses, descriptions of business and
other financial and business information to the extent such information is
required to be presented in the report being filed. The financial information
of the Marathon Group and U. S. Steel Group and certain financial information
relating to the Delhi Companies, taken together, includes all accounts which
comprise the corresponding consolidated financial information of USX.

       For consolidated financial reporting purposes, USX consists of the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group. The attribution of assets,
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity
between the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group for the purpose of
preparing their respective financial statements does not affect legal title
to such assets and responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of Marathon
Stock and Steel Stock are holders of common stock of USX and continue to be
subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in USX and all of
its businesses and liabilities. Financial impacts arising from either of the
Groups that affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect the results
of operations and financial condition of both groups. In addition, net losses
of any Group, as well as dividends and distributions on any class of USX
common stock or series of preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX
common stock or series of preferred stock at prices in excess of par or
stated value, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for payment of
dividends on both classes of USX common stock. Accordingly the USX
consolidated financial information should be read in connection with the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group financial information.

       For information regarding accounting matters and policies affecting
the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group financial statements, see

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

         Marathon is currently conducting exploration and development activities
in 14 countries. Principal exploration activities are in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Angola, Canada, Congo, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Tunisia. Principal development activities are in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Canada, Gabon, Ireland, the Netherlands and Russia. Marathon is also
pursuing opportunities in Western Africa, South America and the Middle East.

         During 1999, exploration activities resulted in discoveries in the
United States, Ireland and the Netherlands.

         The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the number of net
productive and dry development and exploratory wells completed in each of the
last three years (references to "net" wells or production indicate Marathon's
ownership interest or share as the context requires):






- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)  Includes the number of wells completed during the year regardless of the
     year in which drilling was initiated. A dry well is a well found to be
     incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify
     completion. A productive well is a well that is not a dry well.

(b)  Indicates wells drilled in the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir.

(c)  Includes Marathon's equity interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. ("CLAM") and
     Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. ("Sakhalin Energy").

UNITED STATES

         In the United States during 1999, Marathon drilled 40 gross (29 net)
wildcat and delineation ("exploratory") wells of which 22 gross (15 net) wells
encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 22 wells, 2 gross (2 net) wells were
temporarily suspended, and will be reported in the Net Productive and Dry Wells
Completed table when completed. Principal domestic exploratory and development
activities were in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the states of Alaska, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Texas.

         Exploration expenditures during the three-year period ended December
31, 1999, totaled $528 million in the United States, of which $141 million was
incurred in 1999. Development expenditures during the three-year period ended
December 31, 1999, totaled $1,113 million in the United States, of which $205
million was incurred in 1999.





         The following is a summary of recent, significant exploration and
development activity in the United States including discussion, as deemed
appropriate, of completed wells, drilling wells and wells under evaluation.

         GULF OF MEXICO - Marathon continues to consider the Gulf of Mexico
("Gulf") as a core area for domestic growth in oil and gas production and has
committed significant resources to exploit its opportunities.

         On August 12, 1999, Marathon announced a deepwater natural gas
discovery on the Camden Hills prospect, located in the deepwater Gulf on
Mississippi Canyon Block 348. The well was drilled to a depth of 15,080 feet and
encountered over 200 feet of gas pay. In February 2000, Marathon confirmed the
discovery with an appraisal well. Current plans are focusing on project
development options. Marathon is the operator and has a 50.03 percent working
interest in this block.

         Progress continues on the Viosca Knoll Block 786 ("Petronius")
development in the deepwater Gulf. In 1999, efforts focused on rebuilding the
lost platform deck module, which was dropped during installation in 1998. Third
party insurance has covered substantially all rebuilding costs associated with
this incident. The platform module is scheduled to be completed in the first
quarter of 2000 and offshore installation should occur in the second quarter of
2000. The Petronius project is estimated to have proved reserves of 57 million
gross barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE"). The previous estimate of 95 million
gross recoverable BOE included reserves attributable to a pressure maintenance
program. Reserves resulting from the Petronius pressure maintenance program will
be considered proved only when such project is in operation and shows successful
results. Following commencement of production and the implementation of the
pressure maintenance program, both scheduled for third quarter 2000, Petronius
proved reserves will be reassessed. Marathon holds a 50 percent working interest
in this project.

         In 2000, Marathon plans to drill eight deepwater exploratory wells. To
support the drilling of deepwater prospects, Marathon, along with two other
parties, began a five-year commitment in 1999 on the Noble Amos Runner, a
drilling rig capable of drilling in water depths up to 6,600 feet. Additionally,
by the second quarter of 2000, Marathon expects to take receipt of the recently
completed Transocean-Sedco-Forex Cajun Express, capable of drilling in water up
to 8,500 feet. Marathon has a three-year commitment to utilize this rig.

         ALASKA - To offset the impact of limited rig availability and
relatively high day rates in the Cook Inlet area, Marathon has contracted the
fabrication of a new onshore drilling rig. The Glacier drilling rig is expected
to be in service by the second quarter of 2000 and will support Marathon's
increased development and exploration activities in Alaska. With the completion
of the Cook Inlet Region Incorporation (CIRI) Exploration Agreement, Marathon
gained access to over 600 miles of 2-D seismic and acquired approximately 14
thousand leasehold acres. This acreage includes five active prospects and two
recent Marathon gas discoveries at Wolf Lake and Sterling Deep.

         NEW MEXICO - Marathon's New Mexico gas production is at a record high
due to successful development activity in the Indian Basin field. In 2000, 15
additional development wells are planned for this field. Marathon's Indian Basin
gas plant is presently operating at maximum capacity following a 1999 expansion.

         OKLAHOMA - A 1998 Marathon exploration gas discovery in the Granite
Wash formation resulted in significant development drilling in 1999. Marathon's
current production from five wells in this area is 14 net million cubic feet per
day ("mmcfd"). In 2000, 15 development wells are planned in the Granite Wash
formation. In addition, the Carter Knox field net gas rate increased by 45
percent in 1999. With a strategic 2000 acquisition, the net rate for this field
now exceeds 60 gross mmcfd. In 2000, 15 development wells are planned for the
Carter Knox field.

         TEXAS - In East Texas, Marathon continued an active gas reserves
development program in the Austin Chalk trend. This play utilizes horizontal
drilling to significantly enhance the per-well rates and reserve recoveries in
the fractured Austin Chalk.




INTERNATIONAL

         Outside the United States during 1999, Marathon drilled 71 gross (49
net) exploratory wells in 5 countries. Of these 71 wells, 47 gross (33 net)
wells encountered hydrocarbons, of which 38 gross (26 net) wells were
temporarily suspended and will be reported in the Net Productive and Dry Wells
Completed table when completed.

         Marathon's expenditures for international oil and natural gas
exploration activities, including Marathon's 50 percent equity interest in CLAM
and 37.5 percent equity interest in Sakhalin Energy, during the three-year
period ended December 31, 1999, totaled $342 million, of which $118 million was
incurred in 1999. Marathon's international development expenditures, including
CLAM and Sakhalin Energy, during the three-year period ended December 31, 1999,
totaled $714 million, of which $235 million was incurred in 1999.

         The following is a summary of recent, significant exploration and
development activity outside the United States, including discussion, as deemed
appropriate, of completed wells, drilling wells and wells under evaluation.

         UNITED KINGDOM - Marathon is continuing its development of the Brae
area in the U.K. North Sea where it is the operator and owns a 41.6 percent
revenue interest in the South, Central and North Brae fields, a 38.5 percent
revenue interest in the East Brae field and a 28.1 percent revenue interest in
the West Brae/Sedgwick joint development project. Marathon has interests in 30
blocks in the U.K. North Sea and other offshore areas.

         Three exploration wells were drilled offshore the U.K. in 1999, one was
dry, one was a non-commercial discovery and the third is being evaluated
further. Two exploration wells are planned for U.K. acreage in 2000.

         ANGOLA - In May 1999, Marathon was awarded an interest in Blocks 31 and
32 offshore Angola. The blocks, which are located approximately 90 miles
northwest of Luanda in water depths between 5,400 and 9,200 feet, are adjacent
to Blocks 15 and 17 where major discoveries by others have been made. Marathon
holds a 10 percent working interest in these blocks, which are operated by
co-venturers. In December 1999, a 3-D seismic program started on Block 31. A
seismic program for Block 32 is presently planned for 2000.

         CANADA - In May 1999, Marathon Canada Limited ("MCL") was awarded three
exploration licenses offshore Nova Scotia. Marathon has a 30, 33.75 and 37.5
percent interest in Exploration Licenses ("EL") 2377, 2384 and 2376,
respectively and will be the operator of EL 2377. In 2000, 3-D seismic data for
EL 2377 and 2376 will be acquired and evaluated.

         In its first full year of operations, MCL completed an aggressive
exploration and development program in the onshore western Canada region. The
1999 program resulted in net reserve additions of 27 million BOE. In 2000, MCL
plans to continue the exploitation of this region with a significant drilling
program.

         CONGO - In February 2000, Marathon acquired a 15 percent equity
interest in the Mer Profonde Nord Permit, which is operated by a co-venturer.
This permit is located approximately 30 miles offshore Republic of Congo in
water depths between 500 and 7,000 feet. In 2000, one exploratory well is
planned in this permit.

         DENMARK - In June 1998, Marathon acquired one block in Denmark, a new
operating country for Marathon. The geological and field development knowledge
obtained from the Brae/Sedgwick area of the United Kingdom led to the
identification of the areas awarded to Marathon. A 3-D seismic program was
completed in 1999 and the data will be evaluated in 2000.



         GABON - In September 1999, oil production commenced from the Tchatamba
South field in the Kowe Permit, located 20 miles offshore Gabon. Field reserves
are estimated to be approximately 30 million gross BOE. Marathon is the operator
of this field. Its working interest was proportionately reduced from 75 percent
to 56.25 percent in 1999 after the Gabonese government exercised its right to
obtain a 25 percent interest in the field.

         The Tchatamba West discovery was drilled in early 1998, 4.5 miles
northwest of the Tchatamba Marin production facilities. This field has estimated
reserves of seven million gross BOE, and is being developed as a one-well
development tied back to the Tchatamba Marin facility. Production is expected
from this field in the fourth quarter of 2000.

         In June 1998, Marathon and its partner announced an oil discovery on
the East Orovinyare prospect, four miles offshore Gabon. The East Orovinyare
No. 1 wildcat well was drilled in the Kowe Permit in 65 feet of water and
encountered an oil column in excess of 400 feet. The first appraisal well, East
Orovinyare No. 2, was drilled in 1998 and tested a combined daily flow rate of
2,460 barrels of 35-degree API gravity of oil. In 1999, a second appraisal well
was drilled, which did not encounter hydrocarbons and reduced the potential size
of the reservoir. Studies are currently underway to determine if an economic
scenario exists for development of this field.

         Marathon is the operator and holds a 75 percent working interest in the
Tchatamba West and East Orovinyare fields. Under the terms of the Kowe Permit,
the Gabonese government has the right to obtain a maximum 25 percent working
interest in any development, which would proportionately reduce Marathon's
interest.

         During early 1999, an exploratory well was drilled in the deepwater
Akoumba Marin Permit, which did not encounter hydrocarbons. In June 1999,
Marathon relinquished the permit and its 100 percent working interest in this
concession.

         In 1998, Marathon acquired a 50 percent working interest in the
Inguessi Permit, which is adjacent to the Kowe Permit. During 1999, Marathon
acquired 139 square miles of 3-D seismic data. This data will be used to
evaluate this permit for future exploration opportunities. Under the terms of
the Inguessi Permit, the Gabonese government has the right to obtain a maximum
10 percent working interest in any development, which would proportionately
reduce Marathon's interest.

         IRELAND - In October 1999, gas production commenced from the Southwest
Kinsale field, located in the Irish Celtic Sea approximately 30 miles south of
Cork. Field reserves are estimated to contain approximately 36 billion cubic
feet ("bcf") of recoverable gas. Marathon has a 100 percent working interest in
this field.

         In August 1999, Marathon announced that a successful appraisal well was
drilled in the Corrib gas field in Slyne Trough License PL 2/93, located 40
miles off the west coast of Ireland. The well, which was drilled in 1,103 feet
of water to a total depth of 12,274 feet, achieved test rates up to 64 gross
mmcfd of gas. Another appraisal well is planned for the Corrib field in 2000,
which will likely be followed by a field development plan. Marathon owns an 18.5
percent working interest in this field. Also in 1999, Marathon drilled an
unsuccessful exploratory well in Slyne Trough License PL 3/94.

         NETHERLANDS - In 1999, Marathon, through its 50 percent equity interest
in CLAM, participated in two exploratory wells and one development well in the
Dutch sector of the North Sea. In August 1999, CLAM announced a second gas
discovery on the Q4 Block in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The well tested
at 26 to 28 gross mmcfd of gas in two separate zones. Marathon holds a 9.9
percent equity interest in this block.

         In 1998, CLAM was awarded two blocks in the Danish sector of the North
Sea. In 1999, 3-D seismic surveys were acquired and two exploration wells are
presently planned for 2000.



         Independent from its interest in CLAM, in January 1999, Marathon was
awarded the A-15 block in the Netherlands North Sea. Marathon holds a 40 percent
working interest in this block, which is operated by a co-venturer. An
exploration well was drilled in 1999, which tested at 20 gross mmcfd of gas. A
3-D seismic program is presently planned for 2000.

         RUSSIA - Marathon holds a 37.5 percent interest in Sakhalin Energy, an
incorporated joint venture company responsible for the overall management of the
Sakhalin II project. This project includes development of the Piltun-Astokhskoye
("P-A") oil field and the Lunskoye gas-condensate field, which are located 8-12
miles offshore Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East Region. The Russian State
Reserves Committee has approved estimated combined reserves for the P-A and
Lunskoye fields of 1 billion gross barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 14
trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

         In July 1999, oil production commmenced from the P-A field and the
first lifting occurred on September 20, 1999. In late September, production was
shut-in following a failure of the mooring system and resumed only for brief
periods during October and November before operations ceased for the winter in
early December. A re-designed mooring system is expected to be installed in the
second quarter of 2000 and production is expected to resume in June 2000, the
beginning of the ice-free season. In 2000, gross production is expected to
average 36,000 gross barrels per day ("bpd") (on an annualized basis).
Marathon's equity share of reserves from primary production in the Astokh
Feature is 80 million barrels of oil.

         Further development of the P-A field continues, including plans to
drill two appraisal and eight development wells in 2000 and to commence
waterflood activity for the Astokh Feature. With respect to the Lunskoye field,
appraisal work and efforts to secure long term gas sales markets continue.
Commencement of gas production from the Lunskoye field, which will be contingent
upon the conclusion of a gas sales contract, is anticipated to occur in 2006 or
later.

         At December 31, 1999, Marathon's net investment in the Sakhalin II
project was approximately $400 million.

         TUNISIA - Marathon's 60 percent working interest in the South Jenein
Permit in southern Tunisia was formally ratified by the government in 1996. In
2000, one exploratory well is planned for the South Jenein Permit.

         The above discussions include forward-looking statements concerning
various projects, drilling plans, expected production and sales levels, reserves
and dates of initial production, which are based on a number of assumptions,
including (among others) prices, amount of capital available for exploration and
development, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory
constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates of mature fields,
reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and other geological,
operating and economic considerations. In addition, development of new
production properties in countries outside the United States may require
protracted negotiations with host governments and is frequently subject to
political considerations and tax regulations, which could adversely affect the
economics of projects. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or
negotiations and other considerations are not satisfactorily resolved, actual
results could be materially different than present expectations.

RESERVES

         At December 31, 1999, the Marathon Group's net proved liquid
hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, including equity affiliate interests,
totaled approximately 1.5 billion barrels on a BOE basis, of which 57 percent
were located in the United States. (Natural gas reserves are converted to
barrels of oil equivalent using a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet
("mcf") of natural gas to one barrel of oil.) On a BOE basis, Marathon replaced
46 percent of its 1999 worldwide oil and gas production. Including dispositions,
Marathon replaced 23 percent of worldwide oil and gas production.





         The table below sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and
gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years.

ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31



(a)   Represents Marathon's equity interests in CLAM and Sakhalin Energy.
(b)   Represents Marathon's equity interests in CLAM.
(c)   Includes Canada for 1999 and 1998.
(d)   Revised to exclude reserves attributable to a pressure maintenance program
      for the Petronius field scheduled to commence in third quarter 2000.

         The above estimates, which are forward-looking statements, are based
upon a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known
physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic
recoverability, production experience and other operating considerations. To the
extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be materially
different than current estimates.

         For additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and
gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see "Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil
and Gas Producing Activities - Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas
Reserves" on page U-32. Reports have



been filed with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") for the years 1998 and
1997 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and gas reserves. A similar report
will be filed for 1999. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the
same as the estimates reported in the USX Consolidated Supplementary Data.

OIL AND GAS ACREAGE

         The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the developed and
undeveloped oil and gas acreage held as of December 31, 1999:



      (a)Represents Marathon's equity interests in CLAM and Sakhalin Energy.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION

         The following tables set forth daily average net production of liquid
hydrocarbons and natural gas for each of the last three years:



(a)   Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
(b)   Amounts reflect production from leasehold and plant ownership, after
      royalties and interests of others.
(c)   Amounts reflect equity tanker liftings, truck deliveries and direct
      deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons before royalties, if any; excluding
      Canada, Gabon and Sakhalin Energy where amounts are after royalties. The
      amounts correspond with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments.
      Crude oil purchases, if any, from host governments are not included.
(d)   Amounts reflect sales of equity production, only. It excludes volumes
      purchased from third parties for resale of 16 mmcfd in 1999 and 23 and 32
      mmcfd in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
(e)   Amounts reflect production before royalties, excluding Canada where
      amounts are after royalties.
(f)   Includes Canada for 1999 and 1998.



         At year-end 1999, Marathon was producing crude oil and/or natural gas
in eight countries, including the United States. Marathon's worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon production, including Marathon's share of equity affiliates
production, increased 12,000 bpd, or approximately 6 percent, from 1998.
Marathon's 2000 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production is expected to increase
from 1999, to average approximately 210,000 bpd. Most of the increase is
anticipated in the second half of the year. This primarily reflects projected
new production from the start-up of Petronius in the Gulf of Mexico in the third
quarter of 2000 and one full ice-free season of production from the P-A field in
Russia, partially offset by natural production declines of mature fields. In
2001, worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production is expected to increase further to
approximately 230,000 bpd.

         Marathon's 1999 worldwide sales of equity natural gas production,
including Marathon's share of CLAM's production, remained consistent with 1998.
In addition to sales of 525 net mmcfd of international equity natural gas
production, Marathon sold 16 net mmcfd of natural gas acquired for injection and
resale during 1999. In 2000 and 2001, Marathon's worldwide natural gas volumes
are projected to be 1.3 billion cubic feet per day ("bcfd") and 1.4 bcfd,
respectively.

         The above projections of 2000 and 2001 liquid hydrocarbon production
and natural gas volumes are forward-looking statements. They are based on known
discoveries and do not include any additions from potential or future
acquisitions/dispositions or future wildcat drilling. They are also based on
certain assumptions, including (among others) prices, amount of capital
available for exploration and development, worldwide supply and demand for
petroleum products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production
decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells,
drilling rig availability, reserve replacement rates and other geological,
operating and economical considerations. If these assumptions prove to be
incorrect, actual results could be materially different than present
expectations.

UNITED STATES

         Approximately 70 percent of Marathon's 1999 worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon production and equity affiliate liftings and 59 percent of worldwide
natural gas production (including CLAM volumes) were from domestic operations.
The principal domestic producing areas are located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
and the states of Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Marathon's
ongoing domestic growth strategy is to apply its technical expertise in fields
with undeveloped potential, to dispose of interests in non-core properties with
limited upside potential and high production costs, and to acquire significant
working interests in properties with high development potential.

         Marathon continues to apply enhanced recovery and reservoir management
programs and cost containment efforts to maximize liquid hydrocarbon recovery
and profitability in mature fields such as the Yates field in Texas and the
Oregon Basin field in Wyoming. Enhanced recovery efforts for the Yates field
include an ongoing evaluation of thermal recovery techniques.

         GULF OF MEXICO - During 1999, Marathon's Gulf production averaged
74,500 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 107 net mmcfd of natural gas,
representing 52 percent and 14 percent of Marathon's total U.S. liquid
hydrocarbon and natural gas production, respectively. Liquid hydrocarbon
production increased by 19,800 net bpd and natural gas production increased by
23 net mmcfd from the prior year, mainly due to increased production from
Troika, Arnold and Oyster, offset by declines from mature fields. At year-end
1999, Marathon held working interests in 14 fields and 31 platforms, 20 of which
Marathon operates.

         In early 1999, the initial Troika subsea development project in the
Green Canyon Block 244 field was completed. This field is located in the central
deepwater Gulf and consists of five wells tied back to a co-venturer's platform.
Production from this field averaged 31,100 net bpd and 47 net mmcfd, ranking it
Marathon's top domestic field in 1999. Additional drilling and reserve
development activities are planned for 2000.



         Ewing Bank 873 is also an important part of Marathon's deepwater
infrastructure. Marathon is the operator and holds a 66.7 percent working
interest. Production averaged 35,400 net bpd and 28 net mmcfd in 1999, compared
with 32,100 net bpd and 24 net mmcfd in 1998, primarily due to increased
production from Arnold and Oyster, two Marathon operated satellite fields that
produce through the Ewing Bank platform. Ewing Bank ranked as Marathon's number
two domestic field in 1999.

         In September 1999, production commenced from the Angus field, a
three-well subsea development on Green Canyon Blocks 112 and 113. In January
2000, Marathon sold its 33.34 percent interest in the Angus development and will
report a pre-tax gain of approximately $85 million in the first quarter of 2000.
Marathon's worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production forecasts discussed
previously exclude estimated 2000 and 2001 production from the Angus field.

         ALASKA -- Marathon's production from Alaska averaged 148 net mmcfd of
natural gas in 1999, compared with 144 net mmcfd in 1998. Marathon's primary
focus in Alaska is the expansion of its natural gas business through
exploration, exploitation, development and marketing.

         NEW MEXICO -- Production in New Mexico, primarily from the Indian Basin
field, averaged 11,900 net bpd and 115 net mmcfd in 1999, compared with 12,500
net bpd and 109 net mmcfd in 1998. The increase in gas production was primarily
due to successful development activity and completion of the plant expansion
project at Indian Basin.

         OKLAHOMA -- Gas production for 1999 averaged 127 net mmcfd,
representing 17 percent of Marathon's total U.S. gas production, compared
with 107 net mmcfd in 1998. The increase in gas production was primarily due
to the successful development program in the Anadarko Basin.

         TEXAS -- Onshore production for 1999 averaged 27,400 net bpd of liquid
hydrocarbons and 166 net mmcfd of natural gas, representing 19 percent and 22
percent of Marathon's total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production,
respectively. Liquids production volumes decreased by 6,500 net bpd from 1998
levels, and gas volumes decreased by 20 net mmcfd from 1998 levels. The liquid
volume decrease was mainly due to natural production declines and the gas volume
decrease was a result of a reduced level of successful activity in east Texas.

         Within Texas, Marathon owns a 49.9 percent working interest in, and is
the operator of, the Yates Field Unit, one of the largest fields in the United
States on the basis of reserves. Marathon's 17,900 net bpd of 1999 liquid
hydrocarbon production from the Yates field accounted for 12 percent of
Marathon's total U.S. liquids production.

         WYOMING -- Liquid hydrocarbon production for 1999 averaged 22,200 net
bpd, representing 15 percent of Marathon's total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon
production, down from 23,700 net bpd in 1998. The decrease in 1999 from 1998 was
primarily due to natural production declines. Gas production averaged 57 net
mmcfd in 1999, compared to 61 net mmcfd in 1998, with the decrease due mainly to
natural production declines.



INTERNATIONAL

         Interests in liquid hydrocarbon and/or natural gas production are held
in the U.K. North Sea, Irish Celtic Sea, the Norwegian North Sea, Canada, Egypt
and Gabon. In addition, Marathon has interests through equity affiliates in the
Netherlands North Sea and Russia.

         U.K. NORTH SEA - Marathon's production is primarily from five fields -
South, North, Central, East and West Brae. Production from the Brae area
averaged 31,100 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 1999, compared with 40,900 net
bpd in 1998. The decrease is mainly within South, North and Central Brae,
reflecting the expected decline of these mature fields.

         The Brae A facilities act as the host platform for the underlying South
Brae field, adjacent Central Brae field and West Brae/Sedgwick fields. North
Brae, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and East Brae are gas
condensate fields. These fields are produced using the gas cycling technique.
Although partial cycling continues, the majority of North Brae gas is being
transferred to the East Brae reservoir for pressure maintenance and sales.

         The strategic location of the Brae A, Brae B and East Brae platforms
and pipeline infrastructure has generated significant third-party business since
1986. Currently, there are 15 agreements with third-party fields contracted to
the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff
revenue, third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area
operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of
the facilities.

         Participation in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation ("SAGE") system
provides pipeline transportation and onshore processing for Brae-area gas. The
Brae group owns 50 percent of SAGE, which has a total wet gas capacity of
approximately 1.0 bcfd. The other 50 percent is owned by the Beryl group, which
operates the system. Pipelines connect the Brae, Britannia, Beryl and Scott
fields to the SAGE gas processing terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland.

         Marathon's total United Kingdom gas sales from all sources averaged 184
net mmcfd in 1999, compared with 188 net mmcfd in 1998. Sales of Brae-area gas
through the SAGE pipeline system averaged 182 net mmcfd for the year 1999 and
185 net mmcfd for the year 1998. Of these totals, 166 mmcfd and 162 mmcfd was
Brae-area equity gas in 1999 and 1998, respectively, and 16 and 23 mmcfd was gas
acquired for injection and subsequent resale in 1999 and 1998, respectively.





         IRELAND -- Marathon holds a 100 percent working interest in the Kinsale
Head and Ballycotton fields in the Irish Celtic Sea. Natural gas sales from
these maturing fields were 132 net mmcfd in 1999, compared with 168 net mmcfd in
1998. This production decline is expected to be partially offset by compressor
modifications implemented in 1999 and 2000, which are expected to improve
recovery from Kinsale Head, and by the new production from the Southwest Kinsale
field.

         NORWAY -- In the Norwegian North Sea, Marathon holds a 23.8 percent
working interest in the Heimdal field, which had 1999 sales of 26 net mmcfd of
natural gas and 500 net bpd of condensate, compared with 1998 sales of 27 net
mmcfd of natural gas and 900 net bpd of condensate. Heimdal production ceased at
the end of September 1999. The Heimdal platform is now being redeveloped as a
center for transportation and processing of third party business, with future
third party revenue commencing in late 2001.

         CANADA -- Production in Canada averaged 17,200 bpd and 150 mmcfd in
1999, compared with 16,000 bpd and 166 mmcfd from August 12, 1998 through
year-end 1998.

         EGYPT -- In September 1999, Marathon sold its interests in two fields
in Egypt, effective June 1, 1999. The transaction included a 50 percent interest
in the Ashrafi oilfield offshore in the southwest Gulf of Suez and a 25 percent
interest in the El Qar'a natural gas and condensate field in the Nile Delta.
Both fields were operated by a co-venturer.

         In October 1999, Marathon agreed to sell its 100 percent interest in
the Gebel El Zeit concession and the Ras El Ush field. In November 1999,
Marathon agreed to sell its 60 percent interest in the El Manzala field.
Marathon operated both fields. The transactions are expected to close in the
first quarter of 2000. The sales are subject to final approval by the Egyptian
authorities and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

         GABON -- Production in Gabon averaged 9,000 net bpd of liquid
hydrocarbons in 1999, compared with 4,700 net bpd in 1998. This increase
primarily reflected new production from the Tchatamba South field.

         NETHERLANDS -- Marathon's 50 percent equity interest in CLAM provides a
5 percent entitlement in the production from 19 gas fields, which provided sales
of 36 net mmcfd of natural gas in 1999, compared with 33 net mmcfd in 1998.

         RUSSIA -- Production in Russia, through Marathon's 37.5 percent equity
interest in Sakhalin Energy, averaged 1,000 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons with
production commencing from the Piltun--Astokhskoye field in July 1999.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

         Refining, Marketing and Transportation operations are primarily
conducted by MAP and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Speedway SuperAmerica LLC and Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC. Marathon holds a
62 percent interest in MAP and Ashland Inc. holds a 38 percent interest in MAP.

         Since MAP is a consolidated subsidiary of Marathon, operating
statistics and financial data applicable to the Marathon Group's RM&T activities
include 100 percent of MAP's operations, commencing January 1, 1998.

         The following discussion of RM&T operations includes historical data
for the three-year period ended December 31, 1999. Operating measures such as
refined product yields and refined product sales in 1999 and 1998 include
100 percent of MAP and are not comparable to 1997.

         MAP added more than $100 million in annual, repeatable pre-tax
operating efficiencies in 1999, raising its total to more than $250 million
since it began operations. MAP has an established goal to ultimately achieve
$400 million in annual, repeatable operating efficiencies. While MAP will
continue to work toward this goal, because of the increasing difficulty in
quantifying additional efficiencies, it will no longer report progress toward
attaining this goal.

REFINING

         MAP owns and operates seven refineries with an aggregate refining
capacity of 935,000 barrels of crude oil per calendar day. The table below sets
forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of MAP's refineries as
of December 31, 1999:



         MAP's refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation,
fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur
recovery units. The refineries have the capability to process a wide variety of
crude oils and to produce typical refinery products, including reformulated
gasoline. MAP's refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize
operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect the refineries allow
the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production
of higher margin products. For example, naphtha is moved from Texas City and
Catlettsburg to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. Gas oil
is moved from Robinson to Detroit and Cattlettsburg where excess fluid catalytic
cracking unit capacity is available. Light cycle oil is moved from Texas City to
Robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available.

         MAP also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt
emulsions and industrial asphalts. MAP manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily
used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries.
Additionally, MAP manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base
oil and slack wax.

         Marathon's 50,000 bpd Indianapolis refinery, which was not contributed
to MAP, has remained idled since October 1993. In 1999, the Indianapolis
refinery was closed.



         During 1999, MAP's refineries processed 888,000 bpd of crude oil and
139,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. The following table sets forth
MAP's refinery production by product group for 1999 and 1998 and Marathon's
refinery production by product group for 1997:



         Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain
refinery operating units ("turnarounds") are periodically performed at each
refinery. MAP completed major turnarounds at the St. Paul Park and Catlettsburg
refineries in 1999.

         MAP and a third party have developed facilities to produce 800 million
pounds per year of polymer grade propylene and polypropylene at the Garyville
refinery. MAP owns and operates facilities to produce polymer grade propylene,
which began production in June 1999. The third party owns and operates the
polypropylene facilities and markets its output.

         MAP is constructing a delayed coker unit at its Garyville, LA refinery.
This unit will allow for the use of heavier, lower cost crude and eliminate the
production of heavy fuel oil. To supply this new unit, MAP reached an agreement
with P.M.I. Comercio Internacional, S.A. de C.V., (PMI), an affiliate of
Petroleos Mexicanos, (PEMEX), to purchase approximately 90,000 bpd of heavy Maya
crude oil. This is a multi-year contract, which will begin upon completion of
the delayed coker unit which is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2001. In
addition, a project to increase crude throughput and light product output is
being undertaken at MAP's Robinson, IL refinery and is also expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001.

MARKETING

         In 1999, MAP's refined product sales volumes (excluding matching
buy/sell transactions) totaled 18.5 billion gallons (1,206,000 bpd). Excluding
sales related to matching buy/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of
petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and
industrial consumers, primarily located in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains
and the Southeast, accounted for about 65 percent of MAP's refined product sales
volumes in 1999. Approximately 48 percent of MAP's gasoline volumes and 78
percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale basis to independent
unbranded customers in 1999.

         The following table sets forth the volume of MAP's consolidated refined
product sales by product group for 1999 and 1998 and Marathon's consolidated
refined product sales by product group for 1997:





         As of December 31, 1999, MAP supplied petroleum products to 3,482
Marathon and Ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in Michigan, Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded retail outlets are also located in West
Virginia, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida, Virginia, Tennessee, Minnesota,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama.

         In 1999, MAP began selling gasoline and diesel fuel under the Marathon
brand in Georgia, Florida and Minnesota. MAP plans to develop a significant
brand presence in these states where it already has the logistical assets in
place to support these jobber owned retail outlets.

         In 1999, retail sales of gasoline and diesel fuel were also made
through limited service and self-service stations and truck stops operated in 21
states by a wholly owned MAP subsidiary, Speedway SuperAmerica LLC ("SSA"). As
of December 31, 1999, this subsidiary had 2,433 retail outlets which sold
petroleum products and convenience-store merchandise, primarily under the brand
names "Speedway" and "SuperAmerica". SSA's revenues from the sale of
convenience-store merchandise totaled $2,056 million in 1999, compared with
$1,827 million in 1998. Profits generated from these sales tend to moderate the
margin volatility experienced in the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.
The selection of merchandise varies among outlets - 2,182 of SSA's 2,433 outlets
at December 31, 1999, had convenience stores which sold a variety of food and
merchandise, and the remaining outlets sold selected convenience-store items
such as cigarettes, candy and beverages.

         On December 10, 1999, MAP finalized the transaction with Ultramar
Diamond Shamrock ("UDS") to purchase 178 UDS owned-and-operated convenience
stores and 5 product terminals. In addition, MAP was assigned supply contracts
with UDS branded jobbers who supply 242 branded jobber stations in Michigan.

         MAP plans to sell 284 SSA gasoline stations located in the Midwest
and Southeast. These non-core marginal assets comprise less than 12 percent
of MAP's owned and operated SSA retail network.

SUPPLY AND TRANSPORTATION

         The crude oil processed in MAP's refineries is obtained from negotiated
lease, contract and spot purchases or exchanges. In 1999, MAP's negotiated
lease, contract and spot purchases of U.S. crude oil for refinery input averaged
349,000 bpd including 23,000 bpd acquired from Marathon. In 1999, 61 percent or
539,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by MAP's refineries was from foreign
sources and acquired primarily from various foreign national oil companies,
producing companies and traders, of which approximately 319,000 bpd was acquired
from the Middle East.

         During the second quarter of 1999, MAP sold Scurlock Permian LLC, its
crude oil gathering business to Plains Marketing, L.P. Scurlock Permian's crude
oil gathering operations were conducted in an area reaching from the Rocky
Mountains to the Gulf Coast. In addition, Scurlock Permian LLC was engaged in
purchasing, selling and trading crude oil, principally at Midland, Texas;
Cushing, Oklahoma and St. James, Louisiana, three of the major distribution
points for United States crude oil. MAP retained the western Canadian operations
of Scurlock Permian LLC.

         MAP operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil
to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. Ninety-three
light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the
Midwest, upper Great Plains and Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a
combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and trucks.

         At December 31, 1999, MAP owned, leased or had an ownership interest in
approximately 383 miles of crude oil gathering lines; 4,091 miles of crude oil
trunk lines; and 2,856 miles of products trunk lines. In addition, MAP owned a
46.7 percent interest in LOOP LLC ("LOOP"), which is the owner and operator of
the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of Louisiana; a
49.9 percent interest in LOCAP Inc. ("LOCAP"), which is the owner and operator
of a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system; and a 37.2
percent interest in the Capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline
extending from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois.



         MAP also has a 33.3 percent ownership interest in Minnesota Pipe Line
Company, which operates a crude oil pipeline in Minnesota. Minnesota Pipe Line
Company provides MAP with access to crude oil common carrier transportation from
Clearbrook, Minnesota to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in the vicinity of
MAP's St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery.

         MAP's subsidiary, Ohio River Pipe Line LLC ("ORPL"), plans to build a
pipeline from Kenova, West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. ORPL is a common carrier
pipeline company and the pipeline will be an interstate common carrier pipeline.
The pipeline is expected to initially move about 50,000 bpd of refined petroleum
into the central Ohio region. Construction is currently expected to begin in
late 2000. However, the construction schedule is largely dependent on obtaining
the necessary rights-of-way, of which over 86 percent have been obtained to
date, and final regulatory approvals.

         MAP's marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that
transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their
tributaries, and the Intercoastal Waterway. In early 2000, MAP exercised
contract provisions to terminate the long term charters on two single-hulled
80,000-deadweight-ton tankers, which had been "bare boat sub-chartered" to a
third party operator. The initial term of these charters was scheduled to expire
in 2001 and 2002, subject to certain renewal options. In January 2000, the
vessels were returned to the owners.

         MAP leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for
movement and storage of petroleum products. MAP also owns and leases a large
number of tractors, tank trailers and general service trucks.

         The above RM&T discussions include forward-looking statements
concerning anticipated operating efficiencies, refinery and pipeline
improvement projects and expected sale of assets. Some factors that could
potentially cause actual results to differ materially from present
expectations include (among others) unanticipated cost or delay associated
with implementing shared technology, completing logistical infrastructure
projects, leveraging procurement strategies, price of petroleum products,
levels of cash flow from operations, obtaining the necessary construction and
environmental permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions,
obtaining the necessary rights-of-way and regulatory approval constraints.
With respect to the expected sale of assets, certain assumptions include
(among others) negotiations with a buyer or buyers, receipt of government
approvals, consent of third parties, satisfaction of customary closing
conditions and other factors. This forward-looking information may prove to
be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those
presently anticipated.

OTHER ENERGY RELATED BUSINESSES

NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

         Marathon owns and operates, as a common carrier, approximately 174
miles of crude oil gathering lines and 187 miles of crude oil trunk lines that
were not contributed to MAP. Marathon also owns an interest in the following
pipeline systems that were not contributed to MAP. Marathon has a 29 percent
interest in Odyssey Pipeline LLC and a 28 percent interest in Poseidon Oil
Pipeline Company, LLC, both Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems. Marathon
has a 24 percent interest in Nautilus Pipeline Company, LLC and a 24 percent
interest in Manta Ray Offshore Gathering Company, LLC, both Gulf of Mexico
natural gas pipeline systems. Marathon has a 17 percent interest in Explorer
Pipeline Company and a 2.5 percent interest in Colonial Pipeline Company, both
light product pipeline systems extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest
and East Coast, respectively.

         Marathon has a 30 percent ownership in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas
liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport
liquefied natural gas ("LNG") to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is
supplied from a portion of Marathon's equity natural gas production in the Cook
Inlet. LNG is sold under a long-term contract with two of Japan's largest
utility companies which calls for the sale of more than 900 gross bcf over the
term of the contract. Marathon has a 30 percent participation in this contract
which is effective through

March 31, 2004, and provides an option for a five-year extension. During 1999,
LNG deliveries totaled 64 gross bcf (19 net bcf), down from 66 gross bcf (20 net
bcf) in 1998.



         In addition to the sale of North American equity oil and natural gas
production, Marathon purchases oil and gas from third-party producers and
marketers for resale. This activity helps to maximize the value of Marathon's
equity production, while meeting customers' needs for secure and source-flexible
supplies.

         On December 15, 1999, Marathon sold Carnegie Natural Gas Company and
its affiliated subsidiaries. The Carnegie companies were engaged in natural gas
production, transmission, distribution, sales and storage activities in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

POWER GENERATION

         Marathon, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Power Company,
Ltd. ("Marathon Power"), pursues development, construction, ownership and
operation of independent electric power projects in the global electrical power
market.

COMPETITION AND MARKET CONDITIONS

         The oil and gas industry is characterized by a large number of
companies, none of which is dominant within the industry, but a number of which
have greater resources than Marathon. Marathon must compete with these companies
for the rights to explore for oil and gas. Acquiring the more attractive
exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving
substantial front-end bonus payments or commitments to work programs. Based on
industry sources, Marathon believes it currently ranks 10th among U.S. based
petroleum corporations on the basis of 1998 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and
natural gas production.

         Marathon through MAP must also compete with a large number of other
companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution
and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. MAP believes it ranks
fourth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining
capacity as of January 1, 2000. MAP competes in three distinct markets --
wholesale, branded and retail distribution -- for the sale of refined products,
and believes it competes with about 50 companies in the wholesale distribution
of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and
industrial consumers; 11 refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum
products to dealers and jobbers; and over 800 petroleum product retailers in the
retail sale of petroleum products. Marathon also competes in the convenience
store industry through MAP's retail outlets.

         The Marathon Group's operating results are affected by price changes in
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products as well as changes in competitive
conditions in the markets it serves. Generally, operating results from
production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while
refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price
increases. Market conditions in the oil industry are cyclical and subject to
global economic and political events.

EMPLOYEES

         The Marathon Group had 32,103 active employees as of December 31, 1999,
which included 28,217 MAP employees. Of the MAP total, 21,939 were employees of
Speedway SuperAmerica, LLC, primarily representing employees at retail marketing
outlets.

         Certain hourly employees at the Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are
represented by the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers
International Union under labor agreements which expire on January 31, 2002,
while certain hourly employees at the Texas City refinery are represented by the
same union under a labor agreement which expires on March 31, 2002. Certain
hourly employees at the St. Paul Park and Detroit refineries are represented by
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters under labor agreements which expire
on May 31, 2002 and January 31, 2003, respectively.



PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS

         For property, plant and equipment additions, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity -
Capital Expenditures" for the Marathon Group on page M-30.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         The Marathon Group maintains a comprehensive environmental policy
overseen by the Public Policy Committee of the USX Board of Directors. The
Health, Environment and Safety organization has the responsibility to ensure
that the Marathon Group's operating organizations maintain environmental
compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Health, Environment and Safety Management Committee, which is comprised of
officers of the group, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with
various environmental compliance programs. Also, the Marathon Group has formed
an Emergency Management Team, composed of senior management, which will oversee
the response to any major emergency environmental incident throughout the group.

         The businesses of the Marathon Group are subject to numerous federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act
("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect
to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with
respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, and the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. In
addition, many states where the Marathon Group operates have similar laws
dealing with the same matters. These laws and their associated regulations are
constantly evolving and many of them have become more stringent. The ultimate
impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly
known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing
regulations for laws such as RCRA and the CAA have not yet been finalized or in
certain instances are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and
regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, new water quality
standards and stricter fuel regulations could result in increased capital,
operating and compliance costs.

         For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of
compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and
Contingencies" on page M-31 and "Legal Proceedings" for the Marathon Group on
page 37.

         The Marathon Group has incurred and will continue to incur substantial
capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
environmental laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with
all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of the Marathon Group's
products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. The
Marathon Group believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to
similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each
competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and
location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and
whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine
transportation of crude oil or refined products.



AIR

         The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions, establishes a
federally mandated operating permit program and allows for civil and criminal
enforcement sanctions. The principal impact of the CAA on the Marathon Group is
on its RM&T operations. The CAA also establishes attainment deadlines and
control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a geographical
area. It is estimated that, from 2000 to 2003, the Marathon Group, which
includes all seven MAP refineries, may spend approximately $90 million in order
to comply with the proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT") Phase
II standards under the CAA. These standards require new control equipment on
Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units and other units. In addition, the standards for
RFG became even more stringent in the year 2000, when Phase II Complex Model RFG
was required. New Tier II Fuels regulations were proposed in late 1999 and the
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has stated that it will finalize these
rules early in 2000. These rules are expected to require reduced sulfur levels
in gasoline. These proposed regulations, as ultimately adopted, would not take
effect until sometime after 2002. It is anticipated that if final regulations
are adopted, consistent with the published proposed regulations then, the
compliance cost for these regulations could amount to a total of several hundred
million dollars spread over a period of several years.

         In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for ozone and particulate
matter. These revisions have been vacated by the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia and remanded to the EPA for further action. The EPA has
sought review of the matter by the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, in
1998, the EPA published a nitrogen oxide ("NOx") State Implementation Plan
("SIP") call, which would require some 22 states, including many states where
the Marathon Group has operations, to revise their SIPs to reduce NOx emissions.
This SIP has been stayed pending judicial review. If the new SIP is upheld by
the courts, the effective date for any additional NOx control mechanisms to be
installed should not be until after May 2003. In December 1999, the EPA granted
a petition from several northeastern states requesting that stricter NOx
standards be adopted by midwestern states, including several states where the
Marathon Group has refineries. It is expected that this recent EPA action may be
challenged in court. The impact of the revised NAAQS and NOx standards could be
significant to Marathon, but the potential financial effects cannot be
reasonably estimated until any necessary judicial review is concluded and the
states, as necessary, develop and implement revised SIPs in response to revised
NAAQS and NOx standards.

WATER

         The Marathon Group maintains numerous discharge permits as required
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA,
and has implemented systems to oversee its compliance efforts. In addition, the
Marathon Group is regulated under OPA-90 which amended the CWA. Among other
requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a
facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or
hazardous substances. Also, in case of such releases, OPA-90 requires
responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for
substantial civil penalties, and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of
this law.

         Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or
operating in domestic waters be double-hulled, and that existing tank vessels
that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from domestic service,
according to a phase-out schedule. In early 2000, MAP exercised contract
provisions to terminate the long term charters on two single-hulled,
80,000-deadweight-ton tankers, which had been "bare boat sub-chartered" to a
third party operator. The initial term of these charters was scheduled to expire
in 2001 and 2002, subject to certain renewal options. In January 2000, the
vessels were returned to the owners. The Coast Guard National Pollution Funds
Center has granted permission to Marathon and Ashland to self-insure the
financial responsibility amount for liability purposes for MAP's tankers, as
provided in OPA-90. In addition, most of the barges, which are used in MAP's
river transportation operations, meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90.
Single-hulled barges owned and operated by MAP are in the process of being
phased out. Displaced single-hulled barges will be divested or recycled into
docks or floats within MAP's system.





         The Marathon Group operates facilities at which spills of oil and
hazardous substances could occur. Several coastal states in which Marathon
operates have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded
liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as
well as ship owner and operator responsibility. Marathon has implemented
emergency oil response plans for all of its components and facilities covered
by OPA-90.

SOLID WASTE

         The Marathon Group continues to seek methods to minimize the generation
of hazardous wastes in its operations. RCRA establishes standards for the
management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting current waste
disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain
past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of
underground storage tanks ("USTs") containing regulated substances. Since the
EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of RCRA
and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing
regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be
accurately estimated. In addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations
are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the
costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until
their implementation becomes more accurately defined.

REMEDIATION

         The Marathon Group operates certain retail outlets where, during the
normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have
occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such
releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards.
The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the
states which administer their own UST programs. The Marathon Group's obligation
to remediate such contamination varies, depending upon the extent of the
releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which
it operates. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the
appropriate state UST reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been
satisfied. Accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are
established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the
amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable.

         As a general rule, Marathon and Ashland retained responsibility for
certain costs of remediation arising out of the prior ownership and operation of
those businesses transferred to MAP. Such continuing responsibility, in certain
situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements which gradually
diminish this responsibility over time.

         USX is also involved in a number of remedial actions under RCRA, CERCLA
and similar state statutes related to the Marathon Group. It is possible that
additional matters relating to the Marathon Group may come to USX's attention
which may require remediation.



U. S.  STEEL GROUP

         The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, the largest steel producer
in the United States, which is engaged in the production and sale of steel mill
products, coke, and taconite pellets; the management of mineral resources;
domestic coal mining; real estate development; and engineering and consulting
services. Certain business activities are conducted through joint ventures and
partially-owned companies, such as USS-POSCO Industries ("USS-POSCO"), PRO-TEC
Coating Company ("PRO-TEC"), Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar"), Clairton 1314B
Partnership, VSZ U. S. Steel, s. r.o., Republic Technologies International, LLC
("Republic"), and until March 31, 1999, RTI International Metals, Inc. ("RTI").
U. S. Steel Group revenues as a percentage of total USX consolidated revenues
were approximately 18 percent in 1999, 22 percent in 1998 and 31 percent in
1997.

         The following table sets forth the total revenues of the U. S. Steel
Group for each of the last three years.


- ------------
(a)  Includes revenue from the sale of steel production by-products, engineering
     and consulting services, real estate development and resource management.

         For additional financial information about USX's industry segments, see
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements - 9. Group and Segment Information" on page U -13.

         The total number of active U. S. Steel Group employees at year-end 1999
was 18,666. Most hourly and certain salaried employees are represented by the
United Steelworkers of America ("USWA"). In August, members of the USWA ratified
a new five-year labor contract, effective August 1, 1999, covering approximately
14,500 employees. The new labor contract, which includes $2.00 in hourly wage
increases phased in over the term of the agreement beginning in 2000 as well as
pension and other benefit improvements for active and retired employees and
spouses, will result in higher labor and benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group
each year throughout the term of the contract. Management believes that this
agreement is competitive with labor agreements reached by U. S. Steel's major
domestic integrated competitors and thus does not believe that U. S. Steel's
competitive position with regard to such competitors will be materially
affected.

         U. S. Steel Mining Company, LLC ("U. S. Steel Mining") entered into a
five-year contract with the United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA"), effective
January 1, 1998, covering approximately 1,000 employees. This agreement follows
that of other major mining companies.


RECENT DEVELOPMENT

         U. S. Steel announced on February 24, 2000, that it entered into a
strategic alliance with e-STEEL Corporation, a leading online exchange for the
global steel industry. e-STEEL provides an easy-to-use, secure web site where
both steel buyers and sellers can initiate, describe, specifically target,
negotiate in real time, and conclude transactions online. U. S. Steel plans to
use the e-STEEL exchange for prime and non-prime transactions. As part of the
agreement, U. S. Steel has taken a minority stake in e-STEEL. e-STEEL also
entered into agreements with USX Engineers and Consultants, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of USX, for joint marketing and implementation of system integration
services.



STEEL INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND COMPETITION

         The domestic steel industry is cyclical and highly competitive and is
affected by excess world capacity, which has restricted price increases during
periods of economic growth and led to price decreases during economic
contraction. In addition, the domestic steel industry, including U. S. Steel,
faces competition from producers of materials such as aluminum, cement,
composites, glass, plastics and wood in many markets.

         U. S. Steel is the largest steel producer in the United States and
competes with many domestic and foreign steel producers. Domestic competitors
include integrated producers which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as
primary raw materials for steel production, and mini-mills which primarily use
steel scrap and, increasingly, iron bearing feedstocks as raw materials.
Mini-mills generally produce a narrower range of steel products than integrated
producers, but typically enjoy certain competitive advantages such as lower
capital expenditures for construction of facilities and non-unionized work
forces with lower employment costs and more flexible work rules. An increasing
number of mini-mills utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled
products. Through the use of thin slab casting, mini-mill competitors are
increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers of flat-rolled
products. Depending on market conditions, the additional production generated by
flat-rolled mini-mills could have an adverse effect on U. S. Steel's selling
prices and shipment levels.

         Steel imports to the United States accounted for an estimated 26%, 30%
and 24% of the domestic steel market for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Steel imports of hot rolled and cold rolled steel decreased 34% in
1999, compared to 1998. Steel imports of plates decreased 52% compared to 1998.
Foreign competitors typically have lower labor costs and are often owned,
controlled or subsidized by their governments, allowing their production and
pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy
considerations as well as prevailing market conditions. While international
trade litigation that was commenced in 1998 and 1999 has provided some relief
from dumped and subsidized steel imports, high levels of imported steel are
expected to continue to have an adverse affect on future market prices and
demand levels for domestic steel.

         On September 30, 1998, U. S. Steel joined with 11 other producers, the
USWA and the Independent Steelworkers Union ("ISU") to file trade cases against
hot-rolled carbon steel products from Japan, Russia, and Brazil. A final
antidumping ("AD") order against Japan was issued on June 23, 1999. In the cases
against Brazil, on July 7, 1999, the U. S. Department of Commerce ("Commerce")
announced final countervailing ("CVD") and AD duty determinations and,
contemporaneously, announced that it had entered into agreements with Brazil to
suspend the investigations. In the case against Russia, on July 13, 1999,
Commerce announced final AD duty determinations and, contemporaneously,
announced that it had entered into an agreement with Russia to suspend the
investigation. In addition, Commerce announced that it had also entered into a
comprehensive agreement concerning all steel product imports from Russia except
for plate products and hot-rolled products. Plate products from Russia are
subject to a suspension agreement signed in 1997. On August 16, 1999, U. S.
Steel, along with four other integrated domestic producers, filed appeals with
the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the hot-rolled carbon steel
suspension agreements with Brazil and Russia.

         On February 16, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with four other producers and
the USWA to file trade cases against eight countries (Japan, South Korea, India,
Indonesia, Macedonia, the Czech Republic, France, and Italy) concerning imports
of cut-to-length plate products. AD cases were filed against all the countries
and CVD duty cases were filed against all of the countries except Japan and the
Czech Republic. On April 2, 1999, the U. S. International Trade Commission
("ITC") determined that the volume of imports from Macedonia and the Czech
Republic were negligible, thereby terminating the investigations as to those
countries. On February 11, 2000, final AD orders were issued against all the
remaining countries, and final CVD orders were issued in all of the remaining
CVD cases.

         On June 2, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with eight other producers, the
USWA and the ISU to file trade cases against twelve countries (Argentina,
Brazil, China, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Slovakia, Taiwan,
Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela) concerning imports of cold-rolled sheet
products. AD cases were filed against all the countries and CVD duty cases
were filed against Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and Venezuela. On July 19,
1999, the ITC issued its preliminary determination that the domestic industry
was being injured or threatened with injury as the result of imports from all
of the countries. It decided, however, to discontinue the investigations of
subsidies on imports from Indonesia, Thailand, and Venezuela. After having
found preliminary margins against each of the countries in each of the
remaining cases, Commerce has announced final AD



margins against Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Russia, South Africa, and Thailand,
and final CVD margins against Brazil. Final decisions from Commerce as to the
remaining countries are expected in the first half of 2000. Commerce has
announced that it has entered into an agreement with Russia to suspend the
investigation. After a final injury hearing, on March 3, 2000, the ITC
determined that the imports from Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Russia, South
Africa, and Thailand were not causing material injury to the domestic
industry, terminating the cases against these countries. The ITC's final
injury determination for the remaining six countries is still pending.
Cold-rolled sheet represents a significant portion of U.S. Steel shipments
and any increase in imports could adversely affect operating results.

         On June 30, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with four other producers and the
USWA to file trade cases against five countries (the Czech Republic, Japan,
Mexico, Romania, and South Africa) concerning imports of large and small
diameter carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure pipe. On August 13, 1999,
the ITC issued its preliminary determination that the domestic industry was
being injured or threatened with injury as the result of imports from all of the
countries and Commerce has announced preliminary duty determinations in each of
the cases. These cases are subject to further investigation by both the ITC and
Commerce.

         U. S. Steel intends to file additional antidumping and countervailing
duty petitions if unfairly traded imports adversely impact, or threaten to
adversely impact, the results of the U. S. Steel Group.

         On September 1, 1999, Commerce and the ITC published public notices
announcing the initiation of the mandatory five-year "sunset reviews" of
antidumping and countervailing duty orders issued as a result of the
cold-rolled, corrosion-resistant, and cut-to-length plate cases filed by the
domestic industry in 1992. Under the "sunset review" procedure, an order must be
revoked after five years unless Commerce and the ITC determine that dumping or a
countervailable subsidy is likely to continue or recur and that material injury
to the domestic industry is likely to continue or recur. Of the 34 orders issued
concerning the various products imported from various countries, 28 will be the
subject of expedited review at Commerce because there was no response,
inadequate response, or waiver of participation by the respondent parties.
Therefore, at Commerce, only six of the orders (corrosion-resistant,
cold-rolled, and cut-to-length plate from Germany; corrosion-resistant from
Japan; cold-rolled from the Netherlands; and cut-to-length plate from Romania)
will be the subject of a full review. The ITC has indicated that it will conduct
full reviews in all 34 of the cases, despite the fact that responses by some of
the respondent countries were inadequate.

         On October 28, 1999, Weirton Steel, along with the USWA and the ISU,
filed a trade case against tin- and chromium-coated steel sheet imports from
Japan. In December 1999, the ITC issued its preliminary determination that the
domestic industry is being injured as a result of the imports from Japan.
Commerce is expected to make an announcement concerning preliminary duty margins
by the end of March 2000. This case is subject to further investigation by both
the ITC and Commerce.

         The U. S. Steel Group's businesses are subject to numerous federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission
and discharge of environmentally sensitive materials. U. S. Steel believes that
its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially
similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with
regard to such other competitors is materially affected by the impact of
environmental laws and regulations. However, the costs and operating
restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations
may have an adverse effect on U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to
domestic mini-mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials
which compete with steel, which may not be required to undertake equivalent
costs in their operations. For further information, see Environmental
Proceedings on page 41, Legal Proceedings on page 40, and Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
on page S-30.



BUSINESS STRATEGY

         U. S. Steel produces raw steel at Gary Works in Indiana, Mon Valley
Works in Pennsylvania and Fairfield Works in Alabama.

         U. S. Steel has responded to competition resulting from excess steel
industry capability by eliminating less efficient facilities, modernizing those
that remain and entering into joint ventures, all with the objective of focusing
production on higher value-added products, where superior quality and special
characteristics are of critical importance. These products include bake
hardenable steels and coated sheets for the automobile and appliance industries,
laminated sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment,
improved tin mill products for the container industry and oil country tubular
goods. Several recent modernization projects further support U. S. Steel's
objectives of providing value-added products including the dualine coating lines
at Fairfield Works and Mon Valley Works for the construction market; the cold
mill upgrades at Gary Works and Mon Valley Works; the second hot-dip galvanized
sheet line at PRO-TEC and the Fairless Works galvanizing line upgrade for the
automotive market. In 1999, U. S. Steel completed the conversion of the
Fairfield Works bloom caster and pipemill to use round semifinished steel for
tubular production, enhancing U. S. Steel's ability to serve the tubular goods
markets. Additional modernization projects in 1999 included the final upgrade of
the hot dip galvanizing line at Fairless, the start-up of the 64" pickle line at
Mon Valley Works, allowing for the shutdown of older, less productive and higher
cost lines, the upgrade of the hot strip mill coilers at Gary Works and the
basic oxygen furnace emissions project at Fairfield Works. These projects
support U. S. Steel's objective of providing quality value-added products and
services to customers.

         In addition to the modernization of its production facilities, USX has
entered into a number of joint ventures with domestic and foreign partners to
take advantage of market or manufacturing opportunities in the sheet, tin mill,
tubular, bar and plate consuming industries.

         U. S. Steel continues to pursue lower manufacturing cost objectives
through continuing cost improvement programs. These initiatives include, but are
not limited to, reduced production cycle time, improved yields, increased
customer orientation and improved process control.

U. S. STEEL SEGMENT OPERATIONS

         U. S. Steel operates plants which produce steel products in a variety
of forms and grades. Raw steel production was 12.0 million tons in 1999,
compared with 11.2 million tons in 1998 and 12.3 million tons in 1997. Raw steel
produced was nearly 100% continuous cast in 1999, 1998 and 1997. Raw steel
production averaged 94% of capability in 1999, compared with 88% of capability
in 1998 and 97% of capability in 1997. U.S. Steel's stated annual raw steel
production capability was 12.8 millions tons for 1999 (7.7 million at Gary
Works, 2.8 million at Mon Valley Works and 2.3 million at Fairfield Works).

         Steel shipments were 10.6 million tons in 1999, 10.7 million tons in
1998 and 11.6 million tons in 1997. U. S. Steel Group shipments comprised
approximately 10.1% of domestic steel shipments in 1999. Exports accounted for
approximately 3% of U. S. Steel Group shipments in 1999 and 4% in both 1998 and
1997.

         The following tables set forth significant U. S. Steel shipment data by
major markets and products for each of the last three years. Such data does not
include shipments by joint ventures and other affiliates of USX accounted for by
the equity method.








The following table lists products and services by facility or business unit:



- --------------------
(a) Equity affiliate

         USX and its wholly owned entity, U. S. Steel Mining, have domestic coal
properties with demonstrated bituminous coal reserves of approximately 787
million net tons at year-end 1999 compared with approximately 790 million net
tons at year-end 1998. The reserves are of metallurgical and steam quality in
approximately equal proportions. They are located in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. Approximately 93% of the reserves are
owned, and the rest are leased. The leased properties are covered by leases
which expire in 2005 and 2012. U. S. Steel Mining's coal production was 6.6
million tons in 1999, compared with 8.2 million tons in 1998 and 7.5 million
tons in 1997. Coal shipments were 6.9 million tons in 1999, compared with 7.7
million tons in 1998 and 7.8 million tons in 1997.

         USX controls domestic iron ore properties having demonstrated iron ore
reserves in grades subject to beneficiation processes in commercial use by U. S.
Steel of approximately 726 million tons at year-end 1999, substantially all of
which are iron ore concentrate equivalents available from low-grade iron-bearing
materials. All demonstrated reserves are located in Minnesota. Approximately 32%
of these reserves are owned and the remaining 68% are leased. Most of the leased
reserves are covered by a lease expiring in 2058 and the remaining leases have
expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2026. U. S. Steel's iron ore operations at
Mt. Iron, Minnesota ("Minntac") produced 14.3 million net tons of taconite
pellets in 1999, 15.8 million net tons in 1998 and 16.3 million net tons in
1997. Taconite pellet shipments were 15.0 million tons in 1999, compared with
15.4 million tons in 1998 and 16.4 million tons in 1997.

         USX's Resource Management administers the remaining mineral lands and
timber lands of U. S. Steel and is responsible for the lease or sale of these
lands and their associated resources, which encompass approximately 300,000
acres of surface rights and 1,500,000 acres of mineral rights in 13 states.

         USX Engineers and Consultants, Inc. sells technical services worldwide
to the steel, mining, chemical and related industries. Together with its
subsidiary companies, it provides engineering and consulting services for
facility expansions and modernizations, operating improvement projects,
integrated computer systems, coal and lubrication testing and environmental
projects.

         USX Realty Development develops real estate for sale or lease and
manages retail and office space, business and industrial parks and residential
and recreational properties.




         For significant operating data for U. S. Steel Operations for each of
the last five years, see "USX Consolidation Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Five-Year Operating Summary - U. S. Steel Group" on page
U-37.

         USX participates directly and through subsidiaries in a number of joint
ventures included in the U. S. Steel segment operations. All of the joint
ventures are accounted for under the equity method. Certain of the joint
ventures and other investments are described below, all of which are at least
50% owned except Transtar, Republic, Acero Prime and the Clairton 1314B
Partnership. For financial information regarding joint ventures and other
investments, see "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to
Financial Statements - 15. Investments and Long-term Receivables" for the U. S.
Steel Group on page S-15.

         USX and Pohang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. ("POSCO") of South Korea
participate in a joint venture, USS-POSCO, which owns and operates the former
U.S. Steel Pittsburg, California Plant. The joint venture markets high quality
sheet and tin products, principally in the western United States market area.
USS-POSCO produces cold-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tin plate and tin-free
steel, with hot bands principally provided by U. S. Steel and POSCO. Total
shipments by USS-POSCO were approximately 1.6 million tons in 1999.

         In August of 1999, USX and Kobe Steel, Ltd. ("Kobe") of Japan completed
a transaction that combined the steelmaking and bar producing assets of USS/Kobe
Steel Company ("USS/Kobe"), a joint venture which owned and operated the former
U. S. Steel Lorain, Ohio Works, with companies controlled by Blackstone Capital
Partners II - those companies being Republic Technologies International, Inc.,
Republic Engineered Steels, Inc. and Bar Technologies, Inc. The new company is
known as Republic Technologies International, LLC ("Republic"). In addition, USX
made a $15 million equity investment in Republic. USX owned 50% of USS/Kobe and
now owns approximately 16% of Republic, which produces raw steel, semi-finished
steel products and bar products. The seamless pipe business of USS/Kobe was
excluded from the transaction and reformed as Lorain Tubular Company, LLC, a
joint venture between USX and Kobe. At the close of business on December 31,
1999, USX completed the purchase of Kobe's 50% interest in Lorain Tubular
Company, LLC which will be included in the U. S. Steel Group.

         USX and Kobe also participate in another joint venture, PRO-TEC, which
owns and operates two hot-dip galvanizing lines in Leipsic, Ohio. The first
galvanizing line commenced operations in early 1993. In November 1998,
operations commenced on a second hot-dip galvanized sheet line which expanded
PRO-TEC's capacity nearly 400,000 tons a year to 1.0 million tons annually.
Total shipments by PRO-TEC were approximately 925,000 tons in 1999.

         USX and Worthington Industries Inc. participate in a joint venture
known as Worthington Specialty Processing which operates a steel processing
facility in Jackson, Michigan. The plant is operated by Worthington Industries,
Inc. The facility contains state-of-the-art technology capable of processing
master steel coils into both slit coils and sheared first operation blanks
including rectangles, trapezoids, parallelograms and chevrons. It is designed to
meet specifications for the automotive, appliance, furniture and metal door
industries. In 1999, Worthington Specialty Processing processed approximately
397,000 tons.

         USX and Rouge Steel Company participate in Double Eagle Steel Coating
Company ("DESCO"), a joint venture which operates an electrogalvanizing facility
located in Dearborn, Michigan. This facility enables U. S. Steel to further
supply the automotive demand for steel with corrosion resistant properties. The
facility can coat both sides of sheet steel with zinc or alloy coatings and has
the capability to coat one side with zinc and the other side with alloy.
Capacity is 870,000 tons of electrogalvanized steel annually, with availability
of the facility shared equally by the partners. In 1999, DESCO produced
approximately 790,000 tons of electrogalvanized steel.

         USX and Olympic Steel, Inc. formed a 50-50 joint venture in 1997 to
process laser welded sheet steel blanks at a facility in Van Buren, Michigan.
The joint venture conducts business as Olympic Laser Processing. Startup began
in 1998. Effective capacity is approximately 2.4 million parts annually. Laser
welded blanks are used in the automotive industry for an increasing number of
body fabrication applications. U. S. Steel is the venture's primary customer and
is responsible for marketing the laser-welded blanks.




         USX owns a 46% interest in Transtar, which in 1988 purchased the former
domestic transportation businesses of USX including railroads, a dock company,
USS Great Lakes Fleet, Inc. and Warrior & Gulf Navigation Company. Blackstone
Transportation Partners, L.P. and Blackstone Capital Partners L.P., both
affiliated with The Blackstone Group, together own 53% of Transtar, and the
senior management of Transtar owns the remaining 1%.

         USX and VSZ a.s., formed a 50-50 joint venture in Kosice, Slovak
Republic, for the production and marketing of tin mill products to serve an
emerging Central European market. In February 1998, the joint venture, doing
business as VSZ U. S. Steel, s. r.o., took over ownership and commenced
operation of an existing tin mill facility (VSZ's Ocel plant in Kosice) with an
annual production capacity of 140,000 metric tons. In 1999, shipments from the
joint venture were approximately 124,000 metric tons. In 2000, VSZ U. S. Steel,
s. r.o. will resume its planned tin mill expansion of 200,000 metric tons of
capacity.

         In 1997, USX entered into the Clairton 1314B Partnership, a strategic
partnership with two limited partners to acquire an interest in three coke
batteries at Clairton Works. The partnership has an annual coke production
capability of 1.5 million tons. In 1999, production of coke totaled 1.4 million
tons. U. S. Steel, the general partner, owns a 9.78% interest in the Clairton
1314B Partnership.

         In 1997, USX, through its subsidiary, United States Steel Export
Company de Mexico, along with Feralloy Mexico, S.R.L. de C.V., and Intacero de
Mexico, S.A. de C.V., formed a joint venture for a slitting and warehousing
facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. In 1999, the joint venture completed its
first full year of operations, processing approximately 45,000 tons.

         On March 31, 1999, USX irrevocably deposited with a trustee the entire
5.5 million common shares it owned in RTI International Metals, Inc.,
terminating its ownership interest in RTI. The deposit of the shares also
resulted in the satisfaction of USX's obligation under its 6-3/4% Exchangeable
Notes due February 1, 2000. Under the terms of the indenture, the trustee
exchanged one RTI share for each note at maturity. All shares were required for
satisfaction of the indexed debt; therefore, none reverted back to USX.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS

         For property, plant and equipment additions, including capital leases,
see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and
Liquidity - Capital Expenditures" for the U. S. Steel Group on page S-29.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         The U. S. Steel Group maintains a comprehensive environmental policy
overseen by the Public Policy Committee of the USX Board of Directors. The
Environmental Affairs organization has the responsibility to ensure that the
U. S. Steel Group's operating organizations maintain environmental compliance
systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The
Executive Environmental Committee, which is comprised of officers of the
U. S. Steel Group, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with
various environmental compliance programs. Also, the U. S. Steel Group,
largely through the American Iron and Steel Institute, continues its
involvement in the negotiation of various air, water, and waste regulations
with federal, state and local governments to assure the implementation of
cost effective pollution reduction strategies.

         The businesses of the U. S. Steel Group are subject to numerous
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean
Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act ("CWA")
with respect to water discharges; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and
disposal; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of
hazardous substances. In addition, all states where the U. S. Steel Group
operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters. These laws are
constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact
of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known
or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations
for laws such as RCRA and the CAA have not yet been promulgated or in certain
instances are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations,
particularly the CAA, could result in substantially increased capital,
operating and compliance costs.



         For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and the cost of
compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies"
on page S-30 and "Legal Proceedings" for the U. S. Steel Group on page 40.

         The U. S. Steel Group has incurred and will continue to incur
substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as
a result of environmental laws and regulations. In recent years, these
expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet CAA
obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant. To
the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected
in the prices of the U. S. Steel Group's products and services, operating
results will be adversely affected. U. S. Steel believes that its major domestic
integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions
and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such
competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and
regulations. However, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on
U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to domestic mini-mills and some
foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel,
which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations. In
addition, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number
of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its
production methods. For further information, see "Legal Proceedings" on page 40,
and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation
and Contingencies" on page S-30.

         The 1997 Kyoto Global Climate Change Agreement ("Kyoto Protocol")
produced by the United Nations convention on climate change, if ratified by the
U. S. Senate, would require restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the
United States. Options that could be considered by federal regulators to force
the reductions necessary to meet these restrictions could escalate energy costs
and thereby increase steel production costs. Until action is taken by the U. S.
Senate to ratify or reject the Kyoto Protocol, it is not possible to estimate
the effect of regulations that may be considered for implementation of emissions
restrictions in the United States.

AIR

         The CAA imposed more stringent limits on air emissions, established a
federally mandated operating permit program and allowed for enhanced civil and
criminal enforcement sanctions. The principal impact of the CAA on the U. S.
Steel Group is on the coke-making and primary steel-making operations of U. S.
Steel, as described in this section. The coal mining operations and sales of
U. S. Steel Mining may also be affected.

         The CAA requires the regulation of hazardous air pollutants and
development and promulgation of Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT")
Standards. The amendment to the Chrome Electroplating MACT to include the chrome
processes at Gary and Fairless is expected in 2000. The EPA is required to
promulgate MACT standards for integrated iron and steel plants and taconite iron
ore processing by November 15, 2000. The impact of these new standards could be
significant to U. S. Steel, but the cost cannot be reasonably estimated until
the rules are finalized.

         The CAA specifically addressed the regulation and control of coke oven
batteries. The National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants for coke
oven batteries was finalized in October 1993, setting forth the MACT standard
and, as an alternative, a Lowest Achievable Emission Rate ("LAER") standard.
Effective January 1998, U. S. Steel elected to comply with the LAER standards.
U. S. Steel believes it will be able to meet the current LAER standards. The
LAER standards will be further revised in 2010 and additional health risk-based
standards are expected to be adopted in 2020. EPA is in the process of
developing the Phase II Coke MACT for pushing, quenching and battery stacks
which is scheduled to be finalized in 2000. This MACT will impact U. S. Steel,
but the cost cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

         The CAA also mandates the nationwide reduction of emissions of acid
rain precursors (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) from fossil fuel-fired
electrical utility plants. Specified emission reductions are to be achieved by
2000. Phase I began on January 1, 1995, and applies to 110 utility plants
specifically listed in the law. Phase II, which begins on January 1, 2000, will
apply to other utility plants which may be regulated under the law. U. S. Steel,
like all other electricity consumers, will be impacted by increased electrical
energy costs that are expected as electric utilities seek rate increases to
comply with the acid rain requirements.



         In September 1997, the EPA adopted revisions to the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter which are significantly
more stringent than prior standards. EPA has issued a Nitrogen Oxide ("NOx")
State Implementation Plan ("SIP") Call to require certain states to develop
plans to reduce NOx emissions focusing on large utility and industrial boilers.
The impact of these revised standards could be significant to U. S. Steel, but
the cost cannot be reasonably estimated until the final revised standards and
the NOx SIP Call are issued and, more importantly, the states implement their
State Implementation Plans covering their standards.

         In 1999, all of the coal production of U. S. Steel Mining was
metallurgical coal, which is primarily used in coke production. While USX
believes that the new environmental requirements for coke ovens will not have an
immediate effect on U. S. Steel Mining, the requirements may encourage
development of steelmaking processes that reduce the usage of coke. The new
ozone and particulate matter standards could be significant to U. S. Steel
Mining, but the cost is not capable of being reasonably estimated until rules
are proposed or finalized.

WATER

         The U. S. Steel Group maintains the necessary discharge permits as
required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of
the CWA, and it is in compliance with such permits. In 1998, USX entered into a
consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") which resolved
alleged violations of the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") permit at Gary Works and provides for a sediment
remediation project for a section of the Grand Calumet River that runs through
Gary Works. Contemporaneously, USX entered into a consent decree with the public
trustees which resolves potential liability for natural resource damages on the
same section of the Grand Calumet River. In 1999, USX paid civil penalties of
$2.9 million for the alleged water act violations and $0.5 million in natural
resource damages assessment costs. In addition, USX will pay the public trustees
$1 million at the end of the remediation project for future monitoring costs and
USX is obligated to purchase and restore several parcels of property that have
been or will be conveyed to the trustees. During the negotiations leading up to
the settlement with EPA, capital improvements were made to upgrade plant systems
to comply with the NPDES requirements. The sediment remediation project is an
approved final interim measure under the corrective action program for Gary
Works and is expected to cost approximately $30 million over the next six years.
Estimated remediation and monitoring costs for this project have been accrued.


SOLID WASTE

         The U. S. Steel Group continues to seek methods to minimize the
generation of hazardous wastes in its operations. RCRA establishes standards for
the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting current waste
disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain
past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of
storage tanks. Corrective action under RCRA related to past waste disposal
activities is discussed below under "Remediation."

REMEDIATION

         A significant portion of the U. S. Steel Group's currently identified
environmental remediation projects relate to the remediation of former and
present operating locations. These projects include the remediation of the Grand
Calumet River (discussed above), and the closure and remediation of permitted
hazardous and non-hazardous waste landfills.

         The U. S. Steel Group is also involved in a number of remedial actions
under CERCLA, RCRA and other federal and state statutes, and it is possible that
additional matters may come to its attention which may require remediation. For
a discussion of remedial actions related to the U. S. Steel Group, see "Legal
Proceedings - U. S. Steel Group Environmental Proceedings."



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

         The location and general character of the principal oil and gas
properties, plants, mines, pipeline systems and other important physical
properties of USX are described in the Item 1. Business section of this
document. Except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are
leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. The plants and
facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in
age and operating efficiency. At the date of acquisition of important
properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title
examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. The
properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years
without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim.

         Several steel production facilities and interests in two liquefied
natural gas tankers are leased. See "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 11. Leases" on page U-17.

         The basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in
"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary
Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Estimated Quantities of Proved
Oil and Gas Reserves" on pages U-32 and U-33.

         USX believes that its surface and mineral rights covering reserves are
adequate to assure the basic legal right to extract the minerals, but may not
yet have obtained all governmental permits necessary to do so.

         Unless otherwise indicated, all reserves shown are as of December 31,
1999.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened
legal actions, contingencies and commitments related to the Marathon Group and
the U. S. Steel Group involving a variety of matters, including laws and
regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included
below in this discussion. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the consolidated financial
statements and/or to the financial statements of the applicable group. However,
management believes that USX will remain a viable and competitive enterprise
even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
unfavorably.

MARATHON GROUP

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

         The following is a summary of proceedings attributable to the Marathon
Group that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 1999, under federal
and state environmental laws. Except as described herein, it is not possible to
predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management's
belief set forth in the first paragraph under Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" above
takes such matters into account.

         Claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is
intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to
fault. Potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") for each site include present
and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the
substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several.
Because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations, the
difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the
complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as
to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and
cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, USX
is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA.




         Projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for
and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but
not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent
that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of
completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in
forward-looking statements.

         At December 31, 1999, USX had been identified as a PRP at a total of 15
CERCLA waste sites related to the Marathon Group. Based on currently available
information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, USX believes
that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with each of
these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000.

         In addition, there are 8 waste sites related to the Marathon Group
where USX has received information requests or other indications that USX may be
a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available
to confirm the existence of liability.

         There are also 110 additional sites, excluding retail marketing
outlets, related to the Marathon Group where remediation is being sought under
other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties
are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 17
were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland which has retained
liability for all costs associated with remediation. Based on currently
available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, the
Marathon Group believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in
connection with 16 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 33 sites have
potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 10 sites may involve
remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site. In addition,
future costs for cleanup and remediation at one site, described in the following
paragraph is expected to cost more than $5 million. There are 33 sites with
insufficient information to estimate any remediation costs.

         There is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality at a closed and dismantled
refinery site located near Muskegon, Michigan. During the next 5 to 10 years,
the Marathon Group anticipates spending between $5 million and $10 million at
this site. Expenditures for 2000 are expected to be approximately $1.8 million,
most of which will be devoted to the implementation of key, interim remedial
measures which will be the cornerstone of a risk-based corrective action plan.
The risk based corrective action plan is presently under development, and will
be submitted to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in 2000.

         As discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies, on page U-46, in October 1998, the
National Enforcement Investigations Center and Region V of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") conducted a multi-media inspection of
MAP's Detroit refinery. Subsequently, in November 1998, Region V and Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency conducted a multi-media inspection of MAP's
Robinson refinery. These inspections covered compliance with the Clean Air Act
(the Act, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, the "CAA") including New Source
Performance Standards, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, and the National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Benzene, the Clean Water Act
(Permit exceedances for the Waste Water Treatment Plant), reporting obligations
under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and the handling of
process waste. Although MAP has been advised as to certain compliance issues
regarding MAP's Detroit refinery, it is not known when complete findings on
the results of the inspections will be issued. Thus far, MAP has been served
with two Notices of Violation and three Findings of Violation in connection with
the multi-media inspection at its Detroit refinery and one Finding of Violation
at its Robinson Refinery. The Detroit notices allege violations of the Michigan
State Air Pollution Regulations, the EPA New Source Performance Standards and
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for benzene. The
Robinson notice alleges noncompliance with a general conduct provision as a
result of acid-gas flaring since 1994. The Robinson Refinery is alleged to have
routine acid gas flaring arising from a failure to properly operate and maintain
the sulfur recovery plant and amine units. MAP can contest the factual and legal
basis for the allegations prior to the EPA taking enforcement action. At this
time, it is not known when complete findings on the results of these multi-media
inspections will be issued.




         In January 1997, a Notice of Violation ("NOV") was served by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency on the Marathon Group, including
Marathon Oil Company (Robinson Refinery and Brand Marketing, now operating
organizations within MAP), Marathon Pipe Line Company (now Marathon Ashland Pipe
Line LLC) and Emro Marketing Company (now Speedway SuperAmerica LLC),
consolidating various alleged violations of federal and state environmental laws
and regulations relating to air, water and soil contamination. Based on the
ongoing negotiations with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, a penalty in
excess of $100,000 may be assessed against each of these companies. Negotiations
continue with the State Attorney General's office and the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency to resolve these alleged violations. In two of the matters,
the State Attorney General's office has instituted civil actions against
Speedway SuperAmerica LLC with regards to a UST site in Chicago, Illinois and
violations of the CAA dealing with the installation, testing and reporting of
Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems in certain station sites in Illinois.

         In October 1996, EPA Region 5 issued a Finding of Violation against the
Robinson refinery alleging that it does not qualify for an exemption under the
National Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations pursuant to the CAA,
because the refinery's Total Annual Benzene releases exceed the limitation of 10
megagrams per year, and as a result, the refinery is in violation of the
emission control, record keeping, and reports requirements. The Marathon Group
contends that it does qualify for the exemption. However, in February 1999, the
U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") in Chicago, Illinois, filed a civil complaint
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois alleging six
counts of violations of the CAA with respect to the benzene releases.

         In connection with the formation of MAP all three of the refineries
owned by Ashland Inc. ("Ashland") were conveyed effective January 1, 1998, to
MAP or its subsidiaries. Ashland reported in its 1997 Form 10-K, that during
1997, the EPA completed comprehensive inspections of these three refineries,
prior to formation of MAP. These inspections evaluated Ashland's compliance with
federal environmental laws and regulations at those facilities. Ashland reported
in its 1998 Form 10-K, that during 1998, the EPA and Ashland reached an
agreement with respect to the alleged violations discovered during those
inspections. Ashland reported that it agreed to pay $5.864 million in civil
penalties. Ashland also reported that it would undertake specific remedial
projects and improvements at the refinery sites, as well as a number of
supplemental environmental projects involving improvements to the facilities'
operations. Ashland reported that the total cost of these projects is expected
to be $26 million. Under the terms of its agreements with MAP, Ashland has
retained responsibility for matters arising out of these inspections, including
commencement of work as soon as practical on certain enumerated projects.

POSTED PRICE LITIGATION

         The Marathon Group, alone or with other energy companies, was named in
a number of lawsuits in State and Federal courts alleging various causes of
action related to crude oil royalty payments. The plaintiff's allegations
included underpayment of royalties and severance taxes, antitrust violations,
and violation of the Texas common purchaser statute. Governmental entities,
individuals and private entities were among the plaintiffs.

         A settlement agreement which addressed all private claims (subject to
opt-outs) for a period from January 1, 1986 to September 30, 1998 was approved
by the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in April 1999.
However, the approval of the settlement has been appealed to the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals.

         Marathon and approximately 20 other oil companies have settled a claim
by the state of Texas that the oil companies allegedly violated Texas' common
purchaser statute and underpaid royalties on oil produced from state lands.
Under the settlement the companies paid a total of $12.6 million.

         Marathon was named by relators as a defendant, along with 17 other
energy companies, in a lawsuit under the False Claims Act in the U.S. District
Court of Texas (Eastern District). This case is scheduled for trial in September
2000. Marathon has recently reached an agreement in principle to settle the
case, but finalization of a settlement is expected to take until the fall.

         The Marathon Group intends to vigorously defend the remaining cases.





MANTEO
         On July 18, 1997, the United States Court of Federal Claims, Case No.
92-331C, entered a judgment in the amount of $78 million in favor of Marathon
Oil Company and against the United States of America. The U. S. government was
effectively ordered to return lease bonuses that Marathon paid in 1981 for
interest in five oil and gas leases offshore North Carolina. The lawsuit filed
in May 1992 alleged, inter alia, that the federal government breached the leases
through passage of legislation which disputed the company's rights to explore,
develop, and produce hydrocarbons from the leases. The Department of Justice
appealed the trial court's decision to the U. S. Court of Appeals for Federal
Claims which reversed the trial court. During the fourth quarter of 1999,
Marathon's request for Writ of Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court was granted.
Oral argument is scheduled for March 22, 2000.


U. S. STEEL GROUP

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INLAND STEEL PATENT LITIGATION

         In July 1991, Inland Steel Company ("Inland") filed an action against
USX and another domestic steel producer in the U. S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging defendants had
infringed two of Inland's steel-related patents. Inland seeks monetary damages
of up to approximately $50 million and an injunction against future
infringement. USX in its answer and counterclaim alleges the patents are invalid
and not infringed and seeks a declaratory judgment to such effect. In May 1993,
a jury found USX to have infringed the patents. The District Court has yet to
rule on the validity of the patents. In July 1993, the U. S. Patent Office
rejected the claims of the two Inland patents upon a reexamination at the
request of USX and the other steel producer. A further request was submitted by
USX to the Patent Office in October 1993, presenting additional questions as to
patentability which was granted and consolidated for consideration with the
original request. In 1994, the Patent Office issued a decision rejecting all
claims of the Inland patents. On September 21, 1999, the Patent Office Board of
Appeals affirmed the decision of the Patent Office. Inland filed a notice of
appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on November 17, 1999.

ASBESTOS LITIGATION

         USX has been and is a defendant in a large number of cases in which
plaintiffs allege injury resulting from exposure to asbestos. Many of these
cases involve multiple plaintiffs and most have multiple defendants. These
claims fall into three major groups: (1) claims made under the Jones Act and
general maritime law by employees of the Great Lakes or Intercoastal Fleets,
former operations of USX; (2) claims made by persons who did work at U. S. Steel
Group facilities; and (3) claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to
an electrical cable product formerly manufactured by USX. To date all actions
resolved have been either dismissed or settled for immaterial amounts. It is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters; however, based
upon present knowledge, USX believes that the remaining actions will be
similarly resolved. This statement of belief is a forward-looking statement.
Predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial
uncertainties with respect to (among other things) factual and judicial
determinations, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed
in the forward-looking statements.




ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

         The following is a summary of the proceedings attributable to the U. S.
Steel Group that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 1999, under
federal and state environmental laws. Except as described herein, it is not
possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters; however,
management's belief set forth in the first paragraph under "Item 3. Legal
Proceedings" above takes such matters into account.

         Claims under CERCLA and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is
intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to
fault. PRPs for each site include present and former owners and operators of,
transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is
strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the
ambiguity of the regulations, the difficulty of identifying the responsible
parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative
liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation
techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period
during which such costs may be incurred, USX is unable to reasonably estimate
its ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA.

         Projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for
and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but
not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent
that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of
completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in
forward-looking statements.

         At December 31, 1999, USX had been identified as a PRP at a total of 26
CERCLA sites related to the U. S. Steel Group. Based on currently available
information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, USX believes
that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 12 of
these sites will be between $100,000 and $1 million per site and 7 will be under
$100,000.

         At the remaining 7 sites, USX presently expects that its share in the
remaining cleanup costs at any single site will not exceed $5 million, although
it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of USX's share in any final
allocation of such costs. Following is a summary of the status of these sites:

     1.  At USX's former Duluth, Minnesota Works, USX spent a total of
         approximately $11.2 million through 1999. The Duluth Works was listed
         by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency under the Minnesota
         Environmental Response and Liability Act on its Permanent List of
         Priorities. The EPA has consolidated and included the Duluth Works site
         with the St. Louis River and Interlake sites on the EPA's National
         Priorities List. The Duluth Works cleanup has proceeded since 1989. USX
         is conducting an engineering study of the estuary sediments and the
         construction of a breakwater in the estuary. Depending upon the method
         and extent of remediation at this site, future costs are presently
         unknown and indeterminable.

     2.  The Buckeye Reclamation Landfill, near St. Clairsville, Ohio, has been
         used at various times as a disposal site for coal mine refuse and
         municipal and industrial waste. USX is one of 15 PRPs that have
         indicated a willingness to enter into an agreed order with the EPA to
         perform a remediation of the site. Implementation of the remedial
         design plan, resulting in a long-term cleanup of the site, is estimated
         to cost approximately $28.5 million.

         One of the PRPs filed suit against the EPA, the Ohio Environmental
         Protection Agency, and 13 PRPs including USX. The EPA, in turn, filed
         suit against the PRPs to recover $1.5 million in oversight costs. In
         May 1996, USX entered into a final settlement agreement to resolve this
         litigation and the overall allocation. USX agreed to pay 4.8% of the
         estimated costs which would result in USX paying an additional amount
         of approximately $1.1 million over a two- to three-year period. To date
         USX has spent $750,000 at the site. Remediation commenced in 1999.

     3.  The D'Imperio/Ewan sites in New Jersey are waste disposal sites where a
         former USX subsidiary allegedly disposed of used paint and solvent
         wastes. USX has entered into a settlement agreement with the major PRPs
         at the sites which fixes USX's share of liability at approximately $1.2
         million, $598,000 of which USX has already paid. The balance, which is
         expected to be paid over the next several years, has been accrued.



     4.  The Berks Associates/Douglassville Site ("Berks Site") is situated on a
         50-acre parcel located on the Schuylkill River in Berks County,
         Pennsylvania. Used oil and solvent reprocessing operations were
         conducted on the Berks Site between 1941 and 1986. The EPA undertook
         the dismantling of the Berks Site's former processing area and
         instituted a cost recovery suit in July 1991 against 30 former Berks
         Site customers, as PRPs to recover $8 million it expended in the
         process area dismantling. The 30 PRPs targeted by the EPA joined over
         400 additional PRPs in the EPA's cost recovery litigation. On June 30,
         1993, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to the original
         30 PRPs ordering remediation which the EPA estimates will cost over $70
         million. In June 1996, the PRPs proposed an alternative remedy
         estimated to cost approximately $20 million. USX expects its share of
         these costs to be approximately 7%. In September 1997, USX signed a
         consent decree to conduct a feasibility study at the site relating to
         the alternative remedy. In 1999, a new Record of Decision was approved
         by EPA and the DOJ. Remediation will commence in the spring of 2000.

         In February 1996, USX and other Berks Site PRPs were sued by the
         Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources ("PaDER") for $6
         million in past costs.

     5.  In 1987, the California Department of Health Services ("DHS") issued a
         remedial action order for the GBF/Pittsburg landfill near Pittsburg,
         California. Records indicate that from 1972 through 1974, Pittsburg
         Works arranged for the disposal of approximately 2.6 million gallons of
         waste oil, sludge, caustic mud and acid which were eventually taken to
         this landfill for disposal. The DHS recently requested that an interim
         remediation of one of the plumes of site contamination be carried out
         as soon as possible. The Generators' Cooperative Group has agreed to
         fund the interim remediation which is expected to cost approximately
         $400,000, of which U. S. Steel paid $43,175. Total remediation costs
         are estimated to be between $18 million and $32 million. In June, 1997,
         the DHS issued a Remedial Action Plan. Work on the Remedial Action Plan
         has been deferred while a Group application for an alternative remedy
         is being reviewed. The GBF Respondents Group has initiated an action
         against parties implicated at the site who have failed to become
         involved in cleanup related activities. In 1998, USX entered into an
         agreement that establishes USX's liability among the site transporter
         and the other participating waste generators at 10.2%. Liability of the
         site owner has yet to be established.

     6.  In 1988, USX and three other PRPs agreed to the issuance of an
         administrative order by the EPA to undertake emergency removal work at
         the Municipal & Industrial Disposal Co. site in Elizabeth,
         Pennsylvania. The cost of such removal, which has been completed, was
         approximately $4.2 million, of which USX paid $3.4 million. The EPA has
         indicated that further remediation of this site may be required in the
         future, but it has not conducted any assessment or investigation to
         support what remediation would be required. In October 1991, the PaDER
         placed the site on the Pennsylvania State Superfund list and began a
         Remedial Investigation ("RI") which was issued in 1997. It is not
         possible to estimate accurately the cost of any remediation or USX's
         share in any final allocation formula; however, based on presently
         available information, USX may have been responsible for as much as 70%
         of the waste material deposited at the site. On October 10, 1995, the
         U.S. DOJ filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for Western
         Pennsylvania against USX and other Municipal & Industrial Disposal Co.
         defendants to recover alleged costs incurred at the site. In June 1996,
         USX agreed to pay $245,000 to settle the government's claims for costs
         against USX, American Recovery, and Carnegie Natural Gas. In 1996, USX
         filed a cost recovery action against parties who did not contribute to
         the cost of the removal activity at the site. USX has reached a
         settlement in principle with all of the parties except the site owner.
         The PRPs are awaiting issuance of the State's Feasibility Study ("FS").



     7.  USX participated with 35 other PRPs in performing removal work at the
         Ekotek/Petrochem site in Salt Lake City, Utah under the terms of a 1991
         administrative order negotiated with the EPA. The removal work was
         completed in 1992 at a cost of over $9 million. In July 1992, the PRP
         Remediation Committee negotiated an administrative order on consent to
         perform a RI/FS of the site. The RI/FS was completed in 1995. A
         remediation plan estimated to cost $16.6 million was proposed by the
         EPA in 1995. In 1997, the EPA issued a revised Record of Decision with
         a remedial action estimated to cost $12.2 million. USX has contributed
         approximately $1.1 million through 1999 towards completing the removal
         work and performing the RI/FS. USX's proportionate share of costs
         presently being used by the PRP Remediation Committee is approximately
         5% of the participating PRPs. The PRP Remediation Committee commenced
         cost recovery litigation against approximately 1,100 non-participating
         PRPs. Almost all of these defendants have settled their liability or
         joined the PRP Remediation Committee. In February 1997, the EPA issued
         an administrative order to USX and other PRPs to undertake the proposed
         remedial action and to reimburse approximately $5 million to de minimus
         PRPs who had earlier settled with the EPA on the basis of a
         substantially greater remedial cost estimate. On December 15, 1997,
         USX, along with forty other parties, signed a consent decree to clean
         up the site. Site cleanup commenced in 1999 and will be substantially
         complete in 2000.

         In addition, there are 12 sites related to the U. S. Steel Group where
USX has received information requests or other indications that USX may be a PRP
under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
confirm the existence of liability.

         There are also 32 additional sites related to the U. S. Steel Group
where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both
federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through
discussions or litigation. Based on currently available information, which is in
many cases preliminary and incomplete, the U. S. Steel Group believes that its
liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 4 of these sites
will be under $100,000 per site, another 4 sites have potential costs between
$100,000 and $1 million per site, and 9 sites may involve remediation costs
between $1 million and $5 million. Another of the 32 sites, the Grand Calumet
River remediation at Gary Works described below, is expected to have remediation
costs in excess of $5 million. Potential costs associated with remediation at
the remaining 14 sites are not presently determinable.

         The following is a discussion of remediation activities at the U.S.
Steel Group's major facilities:

GARY WORKS

         In 1990, a consent decree was signed by USX which, among other things,
required USX to study and implement a program to remediate the sediment in a
portion of the Grand Calumet River. USX has developed a sediment remediation
plan for the section of the Grand Calumet River that runs through Gary Works. As
proposed, this project would require five to six years to complete after
approval and would be followed by an environmental recovery validation. The
estimated program cost, which has been accrued, is approximately $30 million.
USX has entered into a consent decree with the EPA which provides for the
expanded sediment remediation program and resolves alleged violations of the
prior consent decree and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit
since 1990. In 1999, USX paid civil penalties of $2.9 million for alleged
violations of the Clean Water Act at Gary Works. In addition, USX has entered
into a consent decree with the public trustees to settle natural resource damage
claims for the portion of the Grand Calumet River that runs through Gary Works.
This settlement obligates USX to purchase and restore several parcels of
property and pay $1.5 million in past and future assessment and monitoring
costs. In 1999, USX reimbursed past assessment costs of $570,000 and purchased
properties which were conveyed to trustees.



         In October 1996, USX was notified by the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management ("IDEM") acting as lead trustee, that IDEM and the U.S.
Department of the Interior had concluded a preliminary investigation of
potential injuries to natural resources related to releases of hazardous
substances from various municipal and industrial sources along the east branch
of the Grand Calumet River and Indiana Harbor Canal. The Public Trustees
completed a preassessment screen pursuant to federal regulations and have
determined to perform a NRD Assessment. USX was identified as a PRP along with
15 other companies owning property along the river and harbor canal. USX and
eight other PRPs have formed a joint defense group. The Trustees notified the
public of their plan for assessment and later adopted the plan. The PRP group
and the trustees are working to coordinate trustee and PRP assessment
activities.

         On October 23, 1998, a final Administrative Order on Consent was issued
by EPA addressing Corrective Action for Solid Waste Management Units throughout
Gary Works. This order requires USX to perform a RCRA Facility Investigation
("RFI") and a Corrective Measure Study ("CMS") at Gary Works. The Current
Conditions Report, USX's first deliverable, was submitted to EPA in January 1997
and was approved by EPA in 1998. The Phase I RFI work plan was submitted to the
EPA in July 1999. In addition, remediation of contaminated sediments in the Gary
Vessel Slip has been implemented as an interim measure under the corrective
action program. The work is completed and is expected to cost $2.5 million.

         IDEM issued NOVs to USS Gary Works in 1994 alleging various violations
of air pollution requirements. In early 1996, USX paid a $6 million penalty and
agreed to install additional pollution control equipment and programs and
implement programs costing over $100 million over a period of several years. In
1999, USS Gary Works entered into an Agreed Order with IDEM to resolve
outstanding air issues which required the payment of $207,400 and the
installation of equipment at the No. 8 Blast Furnace and the No. 1 BOP to reduce
air emissions. In November 1999, IDEM issued to USS Gary Works a NOV alleging
various air violations. USS and IDEM are meeting to discuss these allegations.

         In February 1999, the USDOJ and EPA issued a letter demanding a cash
payment of approximately $4 million to resolve a Finding of Violation issued in
1997 alleging improper sampling of benzene waste streams at Gary Coke. USS is
negotiating with USDOJ and EPA to settle the action.

CLAIRTON

         In 1987, USX and the PaDER entered into a consent Order to resolve an
incident in January 1985 involving the alleged unauthorized discharge of benzene
and other organic pollutants from Clairton Works in Clairton, Pennsylvania. That
consent Order required USX to pay a penalty of $50,000 and a monthly payment of
$2,500 for five years. In 1990, USX and the PaDER reached agreement to amend the
consent Order. Under the amended Order, USX agreed to remediate the Peters Creek
Lagoon (a former coke plant waste disposal site); to pay a penalty of $300,000;
and to pay a monthly penalty of up to $1,500 each month until the former
disposal site is closed. Remediation costs have amounted to $2.2 million with
another $3.9 million presently projected to complete the project.

FAIRLESS WORKS

         In January 1992, USX commenced negotiations with the EPA regarding the
terms of an Administrative Order on consent, pursuant to the RCRA, under which
USX would perform a RFI and a CMS at Fairless Works. A Phase I RFI report was
submitted during the third quarter of 1997. A Phase II/III RFI will be submitted
following EPA approval. The RFI/CMS will determine whether there is a need for,
and the scope of, any remedial activities at Fairless Works.

FAIRFIELD WORKS

         In December 1995, USX reached an agreement in principle with the EPA
and the DOJ with respect to alleged RCRA violations at Fairfield Works. A
consent decree was signed by USX and the United States and filed with the court
on December 11, 1997, under which USX will pay a civil penalty of $1 million,
implement two SEPs costing a total of $1.75 million and implement a RCRA
corrective action at the facility. One SEP was completed during 1998 at a cost
of $250,000. The second SEP is underway.



MON VALLEY WORKS/EDGAR THOMSON PLANT

         In September 1997, USX received a draft consent decree addressing
issues raised in a NOV issued by the EPA in January 1997. The NOV alleged air
quality violations at U. S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Plant, which is part of Mon
Valley Works. The draft consent decree addressed these issues, including various
operational requirements, which EPA believes are necessary to bring the plant
into compliance. USX has begun implementing some of the compliance requirements
identified by EPA. USX paid a cash penalty of $550,000 and agreed to implement
five SEPs valued at approximately $1.5 million in settlement of the government's
allegations. On October 28, 1999, the government lodged the consent decree in
federal court and the decree became effective February 1, 2000.

      As of January 31, 2000, there were 70,803 registered holders of Marathon
Stock and 55,034 registered holders of Steel Stock.

      The Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on Marathon
Stock and Steel Stock based on the financial condition and results of operations
of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group respectively, although it has no
obligation under Delaware law or the USX Restated Certificate of Incorporation
to do so. In determining its dividend policy with respect to Marathon Stock and
Steel Stock, the Board will rely on the separate financial statements of the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group, respectively. The method of
calculating earnings per share for Marathon Stock and Steel Stock reflects the
Board's intent that separately reported earnings and the surplus the Marathon
Group and the U. S. Steel Group would have if separately calculated, as
determined consistent with the USX Restated Certificate of Incorporation, are
available for payment of dividends to the respective classes of stock, although
the amount of funds legally available under Delaware law for the payment of
dividends on these classes of stock do not necessarily correspond with these
amounts. Dividends on all classes of preferred stock and USX common stock are
limited to legally available funds of USX, which are determined on the basis of
the entire Corporation. Distributions on Marathon Stock and Steel Stock would be
precluded by a failure to pay dividends on any series of preferred stock of USX.
In addition, net losses of either group, as well as dividends or distributions
on either class of USX common stock or series of preferred stock and repurchases
of any class of USX common stock or preferred stock at prices in excess of par
or stated value will reduce the funds of USX legally available for payment of
dividends on the two classes of USX common stock as well as any preferred stock.

      Dividends on Steel Stock are further limited to the Available Steel
Dividend Amount. Net losses of the Marathon Group and distributions on Marathon
Stock, and on any preferred stock attributed to the Marathon Group will not
reduce the funds available for declaration and payment of dividends on Steel
Stock unless the legally available funds of USX are less than the Available
Steel Dividend Amount.

      See "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements - 20. Dividends" on page U-23.

      The Board has adopted certain policies with respect to the Marathon Group
and the U. S. Steel Group, including, without limitation, the intention to: (i)
limit capital expenditures of the U. S. Steel Group over the long term to an
amount equal to the internally generated cash flow of the U. S. Steel Group,
including funds generated by sales of assets of the U. S. Steel Group, (ii) sell
assets and provide services between the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group
only on an arm's-length basis and (iii) treat funds generated by sales of
Marathon Stock or Steel Stock and securities convertible into such stock as
assets of the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel Group, as the case may be, and
apply such funds to acquire assets or reduce liabilities of the Marathon Group
or the U. S. Steel Group, respectively. These policies may be modified or
rescinded by action of the Board, or the Board may adopt additional policies,
without the approval of holders of the two classes of USX common stock, although
the Board has no present intention to do so.



FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE BOARD; RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS

      Under Delaware law, the Board must act with due care and in the best
interest of all the stockholders, including the holders of the shares of each
class of USX common stock. The interests of the holders of any class of USX
common stock may, under some circumstances, diverge or appear to diverge.
Examples include the optional exchange of Steel Stock for Marathon Stock at the
10% premium, the determination of the record date of any such exchange or for
the redemption of any Steel Stock; the establishing of the date for public
announcement of the liquidation of USX and the commitment of capital among the
Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group.

      Because the Board owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless
of class, the Board is the appropriate body to deal with these matters. In order
to assist the Board in this regard, the Board has adopted policies to serve as
guidelines for the resolution of matters involving a conflict or a potential
conflict, including policies dealing with the payment of dividends, limiting
capital investment in the U. S. Steel Group over the long term to its internally
generated cash flow and allocation of corporate expenses and other matters. The
Board has been advised concerning the applicable law relating to the discharge
of its fiduciary duties to the common stockholders in the context of the
separate classes of USX common stock and has delegated to the Audit Committee of
the Board the responsibility to review matters which relate to this subject and
report to the Board. Under principles of Delaware law and the "business
judgement rule," absent abuse of discretion, a good faith determination made by
a disinterested and adequately informed Board with respect to any matter having
disparate impacts upon holders of Marathon and Steel Stock would be a defense to
any challenge to such determination made by or on behalf of the holders of
either class of USX common stock.

         MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX
         Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (USX) are the responsibility
         of and have been prepared by USX in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States. They
         necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments
         and estimates. The consolidated financial information displayed in
         other sections of this report is consistent with these consolidated
         financial statements.
              USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
         financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
         organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of
         responsibility and by communications programs aimed at assuring
         that its policies and methods are understood throughout the
         organization.
              USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
         accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that
         assets are safeguarded and that financial records are reliable.
         Appropriate management monitors the system for compliance, and the
         internal auditors independently measure its effectiveness and
         recommend possible improvements thereto. In addition, as part of
         their audit of the consolidated financial statements, USX's
         independent accountants, who are elected by the stockholders,
         review and test the internal accounting controls selectively to
         establish a basis of reliance thereon in determining the nature,
         extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
              The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area
         of financial reporting and internal accounting control through its
         Audit Committee. This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
         directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the
         independent accountants, management and internal auditors to
         monitor the proper discharge by each of its responsibilities
         relative to internal accounting controls and the consolidated
         financial statements.



         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

         To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

         In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
         appearing on pages U-2 through U-28 present fairly, in all material
         respects, the financial position of USX Corporation and its
         subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
         their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
         in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
         These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's
         management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
         financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
         of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
         accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and
         perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
         financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
         includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
         amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
         accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
         management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
         presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
         for the opinion expressed above.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

After the redemption of the USX - Delhi Group Common Stock (Delhi Stock) on
January 26, 1998 (Note 5), USX has two classes of common stock: USX -
Marathon Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock) and USX - U. S. Steel Group
Common Stock (Steel Stock), which are intended to reflect the performance of
the Marathon and U. S. Steel Groups, respectively. (See Note 9, for a
description of the two Groups.) During 1998, USX issued 878,074 Exchangeable
Shares (exchangeable solely into Marathon Stock) related to the purchase of a
Canadian company. (See Note 3.)

     On all matters where the holders of Marathon Stock and Steel Stock vote
together as a single class, Marathon Stock has one vote per share and Steel
Stock has a fluctuating vote per share based on the relative market value of
a share of Steel Stock to the market value of a share of Marathon Stock. In
the event of a disposition of all or substantially all the properties and
assets of the U. S. Steel Group, USX must either distribute the net proceeds
to the holders of the Steel Stock as a special dividend or in redemption of
the stock, or exchange the Steel Stock for the Marathon Stock. In the event
of liquidation of USX, the holders of the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock will
share in the funds remaining for common stockholders based on the relative
market capitalization of the respective Marathon Stock and Steel Stock to the
aggregate market capitalization of both classes of common stock.

THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THESE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
                                                                            U-7



        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial
        statements include the accounts of USX Corporation and the
        majority-owned subsidiaries which it controls (USX).

             Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures,
        undivided interest pipelines and jointly owned gas processing
        plants are consolidated on a pro rata basis.

             Investments in entities over which USX has significant
        influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
        and are carried at USX's share of net assets plus loans and
        advances.

             Investments in companies whose stock is publicly traded are
        carried at market value. The difference between the cost of these
        investments and market value is recorded in other comprehensive
        income (net of tax). Investments in companies whose stock has no
        readily determinable fair value are carried at cost.

        USE OF ESTIMATES - Generally accepted accounting principles
        require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
        the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
        contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and the reported
        amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Significant
        items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the
        carrying value of long-lived assets; valuation allowances for
        receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets;
        environmental liabilities; liabilities for potential tax
        deficiencies and potential litigation claims and settlements; and
        assets and obligations related to employee benefits. Additionally,
        certain estimated liabilities are recorded when management commits
        to a plan to close an operating facility or to exit a business
        activity. Actual results could differ from the estimates and
        assumptions used.

        REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenues principally include sales, dividend
        and affiliate income, gains or losses on the disposal of assets
        and gains or losses from changes in ownership interests.

            SALES - Sales are recognized when products are shipped or
            services are provided to customers. Consumer excise taxes on
            petroleum products and merchandise and matching crude oil and
            refined products buy/sell transactions settled in cash are
            included in both revenues and costs and expenses, with no
            effect on income.

            DIVIDEND AND AFFILIATE INCOME - Dividend and affiliate income
            includes USX's proportionate share of income from equity
            method investments and dividend income from other investments.
            Dividend income is recognized when dividend payments are
            received.

            DISPOSAL OF ASSETS - When long-lived assets depreciated on an
            individual basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains
            or losses are reflected in income. Gains on disposal of long-
            lived assets are recognized when earned, which is generally at
            the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such
            losses are recognized when long-lived assets are reclassified
            as assets held for sale. Proceeds from disposal of long-lived
            assets depreciated on a group basis are credited to
            accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization with no
            immediate effect on income.

            GAS BALANCING - USX follows the sales method of accounting for
            gas production imbalances and would recognize a liability if
            the existing proved reserves were not adequate to cover the
            current imbalance situation.

            CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP INTEREST - Gains or losses from a change
            in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary or an
            unconsolidated affiliate are recognized in revenues in the
            period of change.

        CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents include cash
        on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt
        instruments with maturities generally of three months or less.

        INVENTORIES - Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market.
        Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the last-in,
        first-out (LIFO) method.

        DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - USX uses commodity-based and foreign
        currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to price
        risk. Management is authorized to use futures, forwards, swaps
        and options related to the purchase, production or sale of crude
        oil, natural gas, refined products, nonferrous metals and
        electricity. While USX's risk management activities generally
        reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price
        changes for raw material purchases and products sold, such
        activities can also encompass strategies which assume price risk.

U-8



     COMMODITY-BASED HEDGING TRANSACTIONS - For transactions that qualify for
     hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses are deferred and
     subsequently recognized in income from operations, as a component of
     sales or cost of sales, in the same period as the underlying physical
     transaction. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative positions
     cannot remain open if the underlying physical market risk has been
     removed. If such derivative positions remain in place, they would be
     marked-to-market and accounted for as trading or other activities.
     Recorded deferred gains or losses are reflected within other current and
     noncurrent assets or accounts payable and deferred credits and other
     liabilities, as appropriate.

     COMMODITY-BASED TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES - Derivative instruments
     used for trading and other activities are marked-to-market and the
     resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period within
     income from operations. This category also includes the use of
     derivative instruments that have no offsetting underlying physical
     market risk.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS - USX uses forward exchange contracts to
     manage currency risks. Gains or losses related to firm commitments are
     deferred and recognized concurrent with the underlying transaction. All
     other gains or losses are recognized in income in the current period as
     sales, cost of sales, interest income or expense, or other income, as
     appropriate. Forward exchange contracts are recorded as receivables or
     payables, as appropriate.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT - USX follows the successful
efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration
and development.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Except for oil and gas producing properties, depreciation
is generally computed on the straight-line method based upon estimated lives
of assets. USX's method of computing depreciation for steel producing assets
modifies straight-line depreciation based on the level of production. The
modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a production level below
81% of capability, to a maximum of 105% for a 100% production level. No
modification is made at the 95% production level, considered the normal
long-range level.

     Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties are
computed using predetermined rates based upon estimated proved oil and gas
reserves applied on a units-of-production method.

     Depletion of mineral properties, other than oil and gas, is based on
rates which are expected to amortize cost over the estimated tonnage of
minerals to be removed.

     USX evaluates impairment of its oil and gas producing assets primarily
on a field-by-field basis using undiscounted cash flows based on total proved
reserves. Other assets are evaluated on an individual asset basis or by
logical groupings of assets. Assets deemed to be impaired are written down to
their fair value, including any related goodwill, using discounted future
cash flows and, if available, comparable market values.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - USX provides for remediation costs and penalties
when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated
costs is reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of remediation
accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment
to a formal plan of action. Remediation liabilities are accrued based on
estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted in certain
instances. If recoveries of remediation costs from third parties are
probable, a receivable is recorded. Estimated abandonment and dismantlement
costs of offshore production platforms are accrued based on production of
estimated proved oil and gas reserves.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - USX recognizes an obligation to provide
postemployment benefits, primarily for disability-related claims covering
indemnity and medical payments. The obligation for these claims and the
related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and
assumptions, including an appropriate discount rate, analogous to the
required methodology for measuring pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized over
future periods.

INSURANCE - USX is insured for catastrophic casualty and certain property and
business interruption exposures, as well as those risks required to be
insured by law or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured losses are
charged against income upon occurrence.

RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been
made to conform to 1999 classifications.

                                                                            U-9

2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                        Effective January 1, 1997, USX adopted American
                        Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
                        Position No. 96-1, "Environmental Remediation
                        Liabilities" (SOP 96-1), which provides additional
                        interpretation of existing accounting standards related
                        to recognition, measurement and disclosure of
                        environmental remediation liabilities. As a result of
                        adopting SOP 96-1, USX identified additional
                        environmental remediation liabilities of $46 million, of
                        which $28 million was discounted to a present value of
                        $13 million and $18 million was not discounted.
                        Assumptions used in the calculation of the present value
                        amount included an inflation factor of 2% and an
                        interest rate of 7% over a range of 22 to 30 years.
                        Estimated receivables for recoverable costs related to
                        adoption of SOP 96-1 were $4 million. The net
                        unfavorable effect of adoption on income from operations
                        at January 1, 1997, was $27 million.
                             In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
                        Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                        No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
                        Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133). This new Standard
                        requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets
                        or liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 133 may result in
                        additional volatility in both current period earnings
                        and other comprehensive income as a result of recording
                        recognized and unrecognized gains and losses resulting
                        from changes in the fair value of derivative
                        instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from
                        adoption of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a
                        cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
                             Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to
                        designate certain derivative instruments as hedges even
                        if the strategy qualifies for hedge accounting
                        treatment. This approach would eliminate the
                        administrative effort needed to measure effectiveness
                        and monitor such instruments; however, this approach
                        also may result in additional volatility in current
                        period earnings.
                             USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of
                        adoption on either the financial position or results of
                        operations. It is not possible to estimate what effect
                        this Statement will have on future results of
                        operations, although greater period-to-period volatility
                        is likely. USX plans to adopt the Standard effective
                        January 1, 2001.

3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

                        In August 1998, Marathon Oil Company (Marathon) acquired
                        Tarragon Oil and Gas Limited (Tarragon), a Canadian oil
                        and gas exploration and production company.
                        Securityholders of Tarragon received, at their election,
                        Cdn$14.25 for each Tarragon share, or the economic
                        equivalent in Exchangeable Shares of an indirect
                        Canadian subsidiary of Marathon, which are exchangeable
                        solely on a one-for-one basis into Marathon Stock. The
                        purchase price included cash payments of $686 million,
                        issuance of 878,074 Exchangeable Shares valued at $29
                        million and the assumption of $345 million in debt.
                             The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the
                        option of the holder at any time and automatically
                        redeemable on August 11, 2003 (and, in certain
                        circumstances, as early as August 11, 2001). The holders
                        of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to receive declared
                        dividends equivalent to dividends declared from time to
                        time by USX on Marathon Stock.
                             USX accounted for the acquisition using the
                        purchase method of accounting. The 1998 results of
                        operations include the operations of Marathon Canada
                        Limited, formerly known as Tarragon, commencing August
                        12, 1998.
                             During 1997, Marathon and Ashland Inc. (Ashland)
                        agreed to combine the major elements of their refining,
                        marketing and transportation (RM&T) operations. On
                        January 1, 1998, Marathon transferred certain RM&T net
                        assets to Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP), a new
                        consolidated subsidiary. Also on January 1, 1998,
                        Marathon acquired certain RM&T net assets from Ashland
                        in exchange for a 38% interest in MAP. The acquisition
                        was accounted for under the purchase method of
                        accounting. The purchase price was determined to be $1.9
                        billion, based upon an external valuation. The change in
                        Marathon's ownership interest in MAP resulted in a gain
                        of $245 million, which is included in 1998 revenues. In
                        accordance with MAP closing agreements, Marathon and
                        Ashland made capital contributions to MAP for
                        environmental improvements. The closing agreements
                        stipulate that ownership interests in MAP will not be
                        adjusted as a result of such contributions. Accordingly,
                        Marathon recognized a gain on ownership change of $17
                        million in 1999.


U-10




                             In connection with the formation of MAP, Marathon
                        and Ashland entered into a Limited Liability Company
                        Agreement dated January 1, 1998 (the LLC Agreement). The
                        LLC Agreement provides for an initial term of MAP
                        expiring on December 31, 2022 (25 years from its
                        formation). The term will automatically be extended for
                        ten-year periods, unless a termination notice is given
                        by either party.
                             Also in connection with the formation of MAP, the
                        parties entered into a Put/Call, Registration Rights and
                        Standstill Agreement (the Put/Call Agreement). The
                        Put/Call Agreement provides that at any time after
                        December 31, 2004, Ashland will have the right to sell
                        to Marathon all of Ashland's ownership interest in MAP,
                        for an amount in cash and/or Marathon or USX debt or
                        equity securities equal to the product of 85% (90% if
                        equity securities are used) of the fair market value of
                        MAP at that time, multiplied by Ashland's percentage
                        interest in MAP. Payment could be made at closing, or at
                        Marathon's option, in three equal annual installments,
                        the first of which would be payable at closing. At any
                        time after December 31, 2004, Marathon will have the
                        right to purchase all of Ashland's ownership interests
                        in MAP, for an amount in cash equal to the product of
                        115% of the fair market value of MAP at that time,
                        multiplied by Ashland's percentage interest in MAP.

                             The following unaudited pro forma data for USX
                        includes the results of operations of Tarragon for 1998
                        and 1997, and the Ashland RM&T net assets for 1997,
                        giving effect to the acquisitions as if they had been
                        consummated at the beginning of the years presented. The
                        pro forma data is based on historical information and
                        does not necessarily reflect the actual results that
                        would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of
                        future results of operations.

                        (a)Excluding the pro forma inventory market valuation
                           adjustment, pro forma net income would have been $747
                           million in 1998 and $1,151 million in 1997. Reported
                           net income, excluding the reported inventory market
                           valuation adjustment, would have been $778 million in
                           1998 and $1,167 million in
                           1997.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MAP AND ASHLAND

                        At December 31, 1999 and 1998, MAP had current
                        receivables from Ashland of $26 million and $22 million,
                        respectively, and current payables to Ashland of $2
                        million at December 31, 1999, and at December 31, 1998,
                        $106 million, including distributions payable.
                             At December 31, 1998, MAP's cash and cash
                        equivalents included a $103 million demand note invested
                        with Ashland, which was repaid in January 1999.
                             MAP has a $190 million short-term revolving credit
                        agreement with Ashland. Interest on borrowings is based
                        on the Federal Funds Rate in effect each day during the
                        period plus 0.30 of 1%. At December 31, 1999, there were
                        no borrowings against this facility.
                             During 1999 and 1998, MAP's sales to Ashland
                        consisting primarily of petroleum products, were $198
                        million and $185 million, respectively, and MAP's
                        purchases of products and services from Ashland were $25
                        million and $45 million, respectively. These
                        transactions were conducted under terms comparable to
                        those with unrelated parties.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

                        Effective October 31, 1997, USX sold its stock in Delhi
                        Gas Pipeline Corporation and other subsidiaries of USX
                        that comprised all of the Delhi Group (Delhi Companies).
                        The transaction involved a gross purchase price of $762
                        million. Under the USX Restated Certificate of
                        Incorporation (USX Certificate), USX was required to
                        elect one of three options to return the value of the
                        net proceeds received in the transaction to the holders
                        of shares in Delhi Stock (Delhi shareholders). Of the
                        three options, USX elected to use the net proceeds of
                        $195 million, or $20.60 per share, to redeem all shares
                        of Delhi Stock. The net proceeds were distributed to the
                        Delhi shareholders on January 26, 1998. After the
                        redemption, 50,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock remain
                        authorized but unissued.
                             The sale of the Delhi Companies resulted in a gain
                        on disposal of $81 million, net of $206 million income
                        taxes.
                             The financial results of the Delhi Group have been
                        reclassified as discontinued operations for 1997 as
                        presented in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
                        and are summarized as follows:

                        (a)   Represents ten months of operations.


                                                                            U-11

7. OTHER ITEMS


                        FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
                           For 1999, 1998 and 1997, the aggregate foreign
                           currency transaction gains (losses) included in
                           determining income from continuing operations were
                           $(12) million, $13 million and $4 million,
                           respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES

                        In 1999, USX irrevocably deposited with a trustee the
                        entire 5.5 million common shares it owned in RTI
                        International Metals, Inc. (RTI). The deposit of the
                        shares resulted in the satisfaction of USX's obligation
                        under its 6 3/4% Exchangeable Notes (indexed debt) due
                        February 1, 2000. Under the terms of the indenture, the
                        trustee exchanged one RTI share for each note at
                        maturity. All shares were required for satisfaction of
                        the indexed debt; therefore, none reverted back to USX.
                             As a result of the above transaction, USX recorded
                        in 1999 an extraordinary loss of $5 million, net of a $3
                        million income tax benefit, representing prepaid
                        interest expense and the write-off of unamortized debt
                        issue costs, and a pretax charge of $22 million,
                        representing the difference between the carrying value
                        of the investment in RTI and the carrying value of the
                        indexed debt, which is included in net gains on disposal
                        of assets.
                             In December 1996, USX had issued $117 million of
                        notes indexed to the common share price of RTI. At
                        maturity, USX would have been required to exchange the
                        notes for shares of RTI common stock, or redeem the
                        notes for the equivalent amount of cash. Since USX's
                        investment in RTI was attributed to the U. S. Steel
                        Group, the indexed debt was also attributed to the U. S.
                        Steel Group. USX had a 26% investment in RTI and
                        accounted for its investment using the equity method of
                        accounting.
                             Republic Technologies International, LLC, an equity
                        method affiliate of USX, recorded in 1999 an
                        extraordinary loss related to the early extinguishment
                        of debt. As a result, USX recorded an extraordinary loss
                        of $2 million, net of a $1 million income tax benefit,
                        representing its share of the extraordinary loss.

9. GROUP AND SEGMENT INFORMATION

After the redemption of the Delhi Stock on January 26, 1998, USX has two classes
of common stock: Marathon Stock and Steel Stock, which are intended to reflect
the performance of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group, respectively. A
description of each group and its products and services is as follows:

   MARATHON GROUP - The Marathon Group includes Marathon Oil Company and certain
   other subsidiaries of USX. Marathon Group revenues as a percentage of total
   consolidated USX revenues were 82% in 1999, 78% in 1998 and 69% in 1997.

   U. S. STEEL GROUP - The U. S. Steel Group consists of U. S. Steel, the
   largest domestic integrated steel producer. U. S. Steel Group revenues as a
   percentage of total consolidated USX revenues were 18% in 1999, 22% in 1998
   and 31% in 1997.




(a)Includes revenue from the sale of steel production by-products, engineering
   and consulting services, real estate development and resource management.

OPERATING SEGMENTS:
USX's reportable operating segments are business units within the Marathon and
U. S. Steel Groups, each providing their own unique products and services. Each
operating segment is independently managed and requires different technology and
marketing strategies. Segment income represents income from operations allocable
to operating segments. The following items included in income from operations
are not allocated to operating segments:
      -  Gain on ownership change in MAP
      -  Pension credits associated with pension plan assets and liabilities
         allocated to pre-1987 retirees and former businesses
      -  Certain costs related to former U. S. Steel Group business activities
      -  Certain general and administrative costs related to all Marathon Group
         operating segments in excess of amounts billed to MAP under service
         contracts and amounts charged out to operating segments under
         Marathon's shared services procedures
      -  USX corporate general and administrative costs. These costs primarily
         consist of employment costs including pension effects, professional
         services, facilities and other related costs associated with corporate
         activities.
      -  Inventory market valuation adjustments
      -  Certain other items not allocated to operating segments for business
         performance reporting purposes (see (a) in reconcilement table on page
         U-15)


                                                                            U-13


The Marathon Group's operations consist of three reportable operating segments:
1) Exploration and Production - explores for and produces crude oil and natural
gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation - refines,
markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the
Midwest and southeastern United States through MAP; and 3) Other Energy Related
Businesses. Other Energy Related Businesses is an aggregation of two segments
which fall below the quantitative reporting thresholds: 1) Natural Gas and Crude
Oil Marketing and Transportation - markets and transports its own and
third-party natural gas and crude oil in the United States; and 2) Power
Generation - develops, constructs and operates independent electric power
projects worldwide. The U. S. Steel Group consists of a single operating
segment, U. S. Steel. U. S. Steel is engaged in the production and sale of steel

10. PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

                        USX has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
                        covering substantially all employees. Benefits under
                        these plans are primarily based upon years of service
                        and final average pensionable earnings, or a minimum
                        benefit based upon years of service, whichever is
                        greater. In addition, pension benefits based upon a
                        percent of total career pensionable earnings cover
                        certain participating salaried employees.
                             USX also has defined benefit retiree health and
                        life insurance plans (other benefits) covering most
                        employees upon their retirement. Health benefits are
                        provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical and
                        major medical benefit provisions or through health
                        maintenance organizations, both subject to various cost
                        sharing features. Life insurance benefits are provided
                        to certain nonunion and union represented retiree
                        beneficiaries primarily based on employees' annual base
                        salary at retirement. For most union retirees, benefits
                        are provided for the most part based on fixed amounts
                        negotiated in labor contracts with the appropriate
                        unions. Except for certain life insurance benefits paid
                        from reserves held by insurance carriers and benefits
                        required to be funded by union contracts, most other
                        benefits have not been prefunded.



                        (a) Results primarily from a new five-year labor
                            contract with the United Steelworkers of America
                            ratified in August 1999.
                        (b) Represents transfers of excess pension assets to
                            fund retiree health care benefits accounts under
                            Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                        


U-16




                        (a) Represents payments to a multiemployer health care
                            benefit plan created by the Coal Industry Retiree
                            Health Benefit Act of 1992 based on assigned
                            beneficiaries receiving benefits. The present value
                            of this unrecognized obligation is broadly estimated
                            to be $90 million, including the effects of future
                            medical inflation, and this amount could increase if
                            additional beneficiaries are assigned.
                        (b) Relates  primarily to the 1999 Marathon Group and
                            1998 U. S. Steel Group voluntary early retirement
                            programs.



                             For measurement purposes, a 7.6% annual rate of
                        increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
                        benefits was assumed for 2000. The rate was assumed to
                        decrease gradually to 5% until 2005 for the U. S. Steel
                        Group and until 2006 for the Marathon Group and remain
                        at that level thereafter.
                             A one-percentage-point change in assumed health
                        care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

11. LEASES

                        Future minimum commitments for capital leases (including
                        sale-leasebacks accounted for as financings) and for
                        operating leases having remaining noncancelable lease
                        terms in excess of one year are as follows:



                             Operating lease rental expense from continuing
                             operations:



                             USX leases a wide variety of facilities and
                        equipment under operating leases, including land and
                        building space, office equipment, production facilities
                        and transportation equipment. Most long-term leases
                        include renewal options and, in certain leases, purchase
                        options. In the event of a change in control of USX, as
                        defined in the agreements, or certain other
                        circumstances, operating lease obligations totaling $105
                        million may be declared immediately due and payable.


                                                                            U-17

12. INCOME TAXES
                        Provisions (credits) for estimated income taxes on
                        income from continuing operations were:



                             A reconciliation of federal statutory tax rate
                        (35%) to total provisions from continuing  operations
                        follows:



                             Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from
                             the following:



                        (a)USX expects to generate sufficient future taxable
                           income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax
                           assets. In addition, the ability to realize the
                           benefit of foreign tax credits is based upon certain
                           assumptions concerning future operating conditions
                           (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices),
                           income generated from foreign sources and USX's tax
                           profile in the years that such credits may be
                           claimed.

                             The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years
                        1990 through 1997 are under various stages of audit and
                        administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has
                        made adequate provision for income taxes and interest
                        which may become payable for years not yet settled.
                             Pretax income (loss) from continuing operations
                        included $63 million, $(75) million and $250 million
                        attributable to foreign sources in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                        respectively.
                             Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated
                        foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 1999, amounted to
                        $150 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
                        taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because USX
                        intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in those
                        foreign operations. If such earnings were not
                        permanently reinvested, a deferred tax liability of $53
                        million would have been required.

13. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT



                             Property, plant and equipment includes gross assets
                        acquired under capital leases (including sale-leasebacks
                        accounted for as financings) of $125 million at December
                        31, 1999, and $108 million at December 31, 1998; related
                        amounts in accumulated depreciation, depletion and
                        amortization were $81 million and $77 million,
                        respectively.

14. INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES



                             Summarized  financial  information  of  affiliates
                       accounted for by the equity method of accounting follows:



                             In 1999, USX and Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe Steel)
                        completed a transaction that combined the steelmaking
                        and bar producing assets of USS/Kobe Steel Company
                        (USS/Kobe) with companies controlled by Blackstone
                        Capital Partners II. The combined entity was named
                        Republic Technologies International, LLC (Republic). In
                        addition, USX made a $15 million equity investment in
                        Republic. USX owned 50% of USS/Kobe and now owns 16% of
                        Republic. USX accounts for its investment in Republic
                        under the equity method of accounting. Dividend and
                        affiliate income (loss) in 1999 includes $47 million in
                        charges related to the impairment of the carrying value
                        of USX's investment in USS/Kobe and costs related to the
                        formation of Republic. The seamless pipe business of
                        USS/Kobe was excluded from this transaction. That
                        business, now known as Lorain Tubular Company, LLC,
                        became a wholly owned subsidiary of USX at the close of
                        business on December 31, 1999.
                             Dividends and partnership distributions received
                        from equity affiliates were $46 million in 1999, $42
                        million in 1998 and $34 million in 1997.
                             USX purchases from equity affiliates totaled $411
                        million, $395 million and $461 million in 1999, 1998 and
                        1997, respectively. USX sales to equity affiliates
                        totaled $853 million, $747 million and $838 million in
                        1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. SHORT-TERM CREDIT AGREEMENT

                        USX has a short-term credit agreement totaling $125
                        million at December 31, 1999. Interest is based on the
                        bank's prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate
                        (LIBOR), and carries a facility fee of .15%. Certain
                        other banks provide short-term lines of credit totaling
                        $150 million which require a .125% fee or maintenance of
                        compensating balances of 3%. At December 31, 1999, there
                        were no borrowings against these facilities.


                                                                            U-19


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.  LONG-TERM DEBT



                        (a)An amended agreement which terminates in August
                           2001, provides for borrowing under a $2,350 million
                           revolving credit facility. Interest is based on
                           defined short-term market rates. During the term of
                           this agreement, USX is obligated to pay a variable
                           facility fee on total commitments, which was .15 % at
                           December 31, 1999. If the receivables facility
                           discussed in (c) is not renewed annually, the balance
                           outstanding of such facility could be refinanced by
                           the revolving credit facility, or another long-term
                           debt source; and therefore, is classified as
                           long-term debt. The commercial paper is supported by
                           the $2,050 million in unused and available credit
                           and, accordingly, is classified as long-term debt.
                        (b)At December 31, 1999, USX had outstanding
                           obligations relating to Environmental Improvement
                           Bonds in the amount of $141 million, which were
                           supported by letter of credit arrangements that could
                           become short-term obligations under certain
                           circumstances.
                        (c)In December 1999, USX entered into an agreement
                           under which the U. S. Steel Group participates in a
                           program to sell an undivided interest in certain
                           accounts receivable. A previous program expired in
                           October 1999 and was accounted for as a transfer of
                           receivables. The new program is accounted for as a
                           secured borrowing. Payments are collected from sold
                           accounts receivable and invested in new accounts
                           receivable for the purchaser and a yield, based on
                           short-term market rates, is transferred to the
                           purchaser. If the U. S. Steel Group does not have
                           sufficient eligible receivables to reinvest for the
                           purchaser, the size of the program is reduced
                           accordingly. The purchaser has a security interest in
                           a pool of receivables to secure USX's obligations
                           under the program. The amounts sold under the
                           previous receivables' programs averaged $291 million,
                           $347 million and $705 million for the years 1999,
                           1998 and 1997, respectively. (The Marathon and Delhi
                           Groups had a separate accounts receivable program
                           that was terminated in late 1997.)
                        (d)MAP has a revolving credit facility for $100 million
                           that terminates in July 2000 and a $400 million
                           revolving credit facility that terminates in July
                           2003. Interest is based on defined short-term market
                           rates for both facilities. During the terms of the
                           agreements, MAP is obligated to pay a variable
                           facility fee on total commitments. At December 31,
                           1999, the facility fee was .11% for the $100 million
                           facility and .125% for the $400 million facility. At
                           December 31, 1999, the unused and available credit
                           was $429 million, which reflects reductions for
                           outstanding letters of credit. In the event that MAP
                           defaults on indebtedness (as defined in the
                           agreement) in excess of $100 million, USX has
                           guaranteed the payment of any outstanding
                           obligations.
                        (e)The guaranteed loan was used to fund a portion of
                           the costs in connection with the development of the
                           East Brae Field and the SAGE pipeline in the North
                           Sea. A portion of proceeds from a long-term gas sales
                           contract is dedicated to loan service under certain
                           circumstances. Prepayment of the loan may be required
                           under certain situations, including events impairing
                           the security interest.
                        (f) Required payments of long-term debt for the years
                            2001-2004 are $747 million, $210 million, $187
                            million and $690 million, respectively.
                        (g)In the event of a change in control of USX, as
                           defined in the related agreements, debt obligations
                           totaling $3,332 million may be declared immediately
                           due and payable. The principal obligations subject to
                           such a provision are Notes payable - $2,525 million;
                           and Guaranteed Loan - $223 million. In such event,
                           USX may also be required to either repurchase the
                           leased Fairfield slab caster for $104 million or
                           provide a letter of credit to secure the remaining
                           obligation.

17. INVENTORIES



                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the LIFO method
                        accounted for 91% and 90%, respectively, of total
                        inventory value. Current acquisition costs were
                        estimated to exceed the above inventory values at
                        December 31 by approximately $570 million and $310
                        million in 1999 and 1998, respectively.
                             The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the
                        extent that the recorded LIFO cost basis of crude oil
                        and refined products inventories exceeds net realizable
                        value. The reserve is decreased to reflect increases in
                        market prices and inventory turnover and increased to
                        reflect decreases in market prices. Changes in the
                        inventory market valuation reserve result in noncash
                        charges or credits to costs and expenses.

19. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

                        The 1990 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, authorizes
                        the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to
                        grant restricted stock, stock options and stock
                        appreciation rights to key management employees. Such
                        employees are generally granted awards of the class of
                        common stock intended to reflect the performance of the
                        group(s) to which their work relates. Up to .5 percent
                        of the outstanding Marathon Stock and .8 percent of the
                        outstanding Steel Stock, as determined on December 31 of
                        the preceding year, are available for grants during each
                        calendar year the 1990 Plan is in effect. In addition,
                        awarded shares that do not result in shares being issued
                        are available for subsequent grant, and any ungranted
                        shares from prior years' annual allocations are
                        available for subsequent grant


                                                                            U-21


                        during the years the 1990 Plan is in effect. As of
                        December 31, 1999, 8,744,297 Marathon Stock shares and
                        2,540,519 Steel Stock shares were available for grants
                        in 2000. The Stock-Based Compensation Plans' activity
                        below includes the Delhi Stock prior to its January 1998
                        redemption (Note 5).
                             Restricted stock represents stock granted for such
                        consideration, if any, as determined by the Compensation
                        Committee, subject to provisions for forfeiture and
                        restricting transfer. Those restrictions may be removed
                        as conditions such as performance, continuous service
                        and other criteria are met. Restricted stock is issued
                        at the market price per share at the date of grant and
                        vests over service periods that range from one to five
                        years.
                             Deferred compensation is charged to stockholders'
                        equity when the restricted stock is granted and
                        subsequently adjusted for changes in the market value of
                        the underlying stock. The deferred compensation is
                        expensed over the balance of the vesting period and
                        adjusted if conditions of the restricted stock grant are
                        not met.
                             The following table presents information on
                        restricted stock grants:



                             Stock options represent the right to purchase
                        shares of Marathon Stock, Steel Stock or Delhi Stock at
                        the market value of the stock at date of grant. Certain
                        options contain the right to receive cash and/or common
                        stock equal to the excess of the fair market value of
                        shares of common stock, as determined in accordance with
                        the plan, over the option price of shares. Stock options
                        vest after a one-year service period and expire 10 years
                        from the date they are granted.
                             The following is a summary of stock option
                        activity:


                        (a)   Weighted-average exercise price
                        (b)   Redemption price

                             The weighted-average grant-date fair value per
                        option for the Marathon Stock was $8.89 in 1999, $10.43
                        in 1998 and $9.01 in 1997. For the Steel Stock such
                        amounts were $6.95 in 1999, $8.29 in 1998 and $6.72 in
                        1997.
                             The following table represents stock options at
                        December 31, 1999:



                             Actual stock-based compensation expense (credit)
                        was $(3) million in 1999 and 1998 and $30 million in
                        1997. Incremental compensation expense, as determined
                        under a fair value model, was not material ($.02 or less
                        per share for all years presented). Therefore, pro forma
                        net income and earnings per share data have been
                        omitted.


U-22


                             Effective January 1, 1997, USX created a deferred
                        compensation plan for non-employee directors of its
                        Board of Directors. The plan permits participants to
                        defer some or all of their annual retainers in the form
                        of common stock units or cash and it requires new
                        directors to defer at least half of their annual
                        retainer in the form of common stock units. Common stock
                        units are book entry units equal in value to a share of
                        Marathon Stock or Steel Stock. Deferred stock benefits
                        are distributed in shares of common stock within five
                        business days after a participant leaves the Board of
                        Directors. During 1999, 10,541 shares of Marathon Stock
                        and 3,798 shares of Steel Stock were issued. During 1998
                        and 1997, no shares of common stock were distributed.

20. DIVIDENDS

                        In accordance with the USX Certificate, dividends on the
                        Marathon Stock and Steel Stock are limited to the
                        legally available funds of USX. Net losses of any Group,
                        as well as dividends and distributions on any class of
                        USX Common Stock or series of preferred stock and
                        repurchases of any class of USX Common Stock or series
                        of preferred stock at prices in excess of par or stated
                        value, will reduce the funds of USX legally available
                        for payment of dividends on all classes of Common Stock.
                        Subject to this limitation, the Board of Directors
                        intends to declare and pay dividends on the Marathon
                        Stock and Steel Stock based on the financial condition
                        and results of operations of the related group, although
                        it has no obligation under Delaware law to do so. In
                        making its dividend decisions with respect to each of
                        the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock, the Board of
                        Directors considers, among other things, the long-term
                        earnings and cash flow capabilities of the related group
                        as well as the dividend policies of similar publicly
                        traded companies.
                             Dividends on the Steel Stock are further limited to
                        the Available Steel Dividend Amount. At December 31,
                        1999, the Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least
                        $3,300 million. The Available Steel Dividend Amount will
                        be increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect U.
                        S. Steel Group net income, dividends, repurchases or
                        issuances with respect to the Steel Stock and preferred
                        stock attributed to the U. S. Steel Group and certain
                        other items.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

                        On September 28, 1999, USX's Board of Directors adopted
                        a new Stockholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend
                        distribution of one right for each outstanding share of
                        Marathon Stock and Steel Stock (referred to together as
                        "Voting Stock") to stockholders of record on October 9,
                        1999. Each right becomes exercisable, at a price of
                        $110, after any person or group has acquired, obtained
                        the right to acquire or made a tender or exchange offer
                        for 15% or more of the outstanding voting power
                        represented by the outstanding Voting Stock, except
                        pursuant to a qualifying all-cash tender offer for all
                        outstanding shares of Voting Stock which results in the
                        offeror owning shares of Voting Stock representing a
                        majority of the voting power (other than Voting Stock
                        beneficially owned by the offeror immediately prior to
                        the offer). Each right entitles the holder, other than
                        the acquiring person or group, to purchase one
                        one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Preferred
                        Stock or, upon the acquisition by any person of 15% or
                        more of the outstanding voting power represented by the
                        outstanding Voting Stock, Marathon Stock or Steel Stock
                        (or, in certain circumstances, other property) having a
                        market value of twice the exercise price. After a person
                        or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding voting
                        power, if USX engages in a merger or other business
                        combination where it is not the surviving corporation or
                        where it is the surviving corporation and the Voting
                        Stock is changed or exchanged, or if 50% or more of
                        USX's assets, earnings power or cash flow are sold or
                        transferred, each right entitles the holder to purchase
                        common stock of the acquiring entity having a market
                        value of twice the exercise price. The rights and the
                        exercise price are subject to adjustment. The rights
                        will expire on October 9, 2009, unless such date is
                        extended or the rights are earlier redeemed by USX for
                        one cent per right at any time prior to the point they
                        become exercisable. Under certain circumstances, the
                        Board of Directors has the option to exchange one share
                        of the respective class of Voting Stock for each
                        exercisable right.

22. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                        The method of calculating net income per share for the
                        Marathon Stock, the Steel Stock and, prior to November
                        1, 1997, the Delhi Stock reflects the USX Board of
                        Directors' intent that the separately reported earnings
                        and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group
                        and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                        USX Certificate, are available for payment of dividends
                        on the respective classes of stock, although legally
                        available funds and liquidation preferences of these
                        classes of stock do not necessarily correspond with
                        these amounts. The financial statements of the Marathon
                        Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, taken
                        together, include all accounts which comprise the
                        corresponding consolidated financial statements of USX.
                             Basic net income per share is calculated by
                        adjusting net income for dividend requirements of
                        preferred stock and, in 1997, the noncash credit on
                        exchange of preferred stock and is based on the weighted
                        average number of common shares outstanding.
                             Diluted net income per share assumes conversion of
                        convertible securities for the applicable periods
                        outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options,
                        provided in each case, the effect is not antidilutive.


                                                                            U-23

23. PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

                        USX Capital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of USX, sold
                        10,000,000 shares (carrying value of $250 million) of
                        8 3/4% Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred Shares (MIPS)
                        (liquidation preference of $25 per share) in 1994.
                        Proceeds of the issue were loaned to USX. USX has the
                        right under the loan agreement to extend interest
                        payment periods for up to 18 months, and as a
                        consequence, monthly dividend payments on the MIPS can
                        be deferred by USX Capital LLC during any such interest
                        payment period. In the event that USX exercises this
                        right, USX may not declare dividends on any share of its
                        preferred or common stocks. The MIPS are redeemable at
                        the option of USX Capital LLC and subject to the prior
                        consent of USX, in whole or in part from time to time,
                        for $25 per share, and will be redeemed from the
                        proceeds of any repayment of the loan by USX. In
                        addition, upon final maturity of the loan, USX Capital
                        LLC is required to redeem the MIPS. The financial costs
                        are included in net interest and other financial costs.
                             In 1997, USX exchanged approximately 3.9 million
                        6.75% Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities
                        (Trust Preferred Securities) of USX Capital Trust I, a
                        Delaware statutory business trust (Trust), for an
                        equivalent number of shares of its 6.50% Cumulative
                        Convertible Preferred Stock (6.50% Preferred Stock)
                        (Exchange). The Exchange resulted in the recording of
                        Trust Preferred Securities at a fair value of $182
                        million and a noncash credit to Retained Earnings of $10
                        million.
                             USX owns all of the common securities of the Trust,
                        which was formed for the purpose of the Exchange. (The
                        Trust Common Securities and the Trust Preferred
                        Securities are together referred to as the Trust
                        Securities.) The Trust Securities represent undivided
                        beneficial ownership interests in the assets of the
                        Trust, which consist solely of USX 6.75% Convertible
                        Junior Subordinated Debentures maturing March 31, 2037
                        (Debentures), having an aggregate principal amount equal
                        to the aggregate initial liquidation amount ($50.00 per
                        security and $203 million in total) of the Trust
                        Securities issued by the Trust. Interest and principal
                        payments on the Debentures will be used to make
                        quarterly distributions and to pay redemption and
                        liquidation amounts on the Trust Preferred Securities.
                        The quarterly distributions, which accumulate at the
                        rate of 6.75% per annum on the Trust Preferred
                        Securities and the accretion from fair value to the
                        initial liquidation amount, are charged to income and
                        included in net interest and other financial costs.
                             Under the terms of the Debentures, USX has the
                        right to defer payment of interest for up to 20
                        consecutive quarters and, as a consequence, monthly
                        distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will be
                        deferred during such period. If USX exercises this
                        right, then, subject to limited exceptions, it may not
                        pay any dividend or make any distribution with respect
                        to any shares of its capital stock.
                             The Trust Preferred Securities are convertible at
                        any time prior to the close of business on March 31,
                        2037 (unless such right is terminated earlier under
                        certain circumstances) at the option of the holder, into
                        shares of Steel Stock at a conversion price of $46.25
                        per share of Steel Stock (equivalent to a conversion
                        ratio of 1.081 shares of Steel Stock for each Trust
                        Preferred Security), subject to adjustment in certain
                        circumstances.
                             The Trust Preferred Securities may be redeemed at
                        any time at the option of USX, at a premium of 102.60%
                        of the initial liquidation amount through March 31,
                        2000, and thereafter, declining annually to the initial
                        liquidation amount on April 1, 2003, and thereafter.
                        They are mandatorily redeemable at March 31, 2037, or
                        earlier under certain circumstances.
                             Payments related to quarterly distributions and to
                        the payment of redemption and liquidation amounts on the
                        Trust Preferred Securities by the Trust are guaranteed
                        by USX on a subordinated basis. In addition, USX
                        unconditionally guarantees the Trust's Debentures. The
                        obligations of USX under the Debentures, and the related
                        indenture, trust agreement and guarantee constitute a
                        full and unconditional guarantee by USX of the Trust's
                        obligations under the Trust Preferred Securities.

24. PREFERRED STOCK

                        USX is authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of
                        preferred stock, without par value -

                        6.50% CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (6.50%
                        PREFERRED STOCK) - As of December 31, 1999, 2,715,287
                        shares (stated value of $1.00 per share; liquidation
                        preference of $50.00 per share) were outstanding. The
                        6.50% Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, at the
                        option of the holder, into shares of Steel Stock at a
                        conversion price of $46.125 per share of Steel Stock,
                        subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This
                        stock is redeemable at USX's sole option, at a price of
                        $51.30 per share beginning April 1, 1999, and thereafter
                        at prices declining annually on each April 1 to an
                        amount equal to $50.00 per share on and after April 1,
                        2003.


                                                                            U-25

25. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

USX remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of the derivative
instrument; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the
underlying hedged item. USX is also exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is
subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements to
the extent practical, and full performance is anticipated.
     The following table sets forth quantitative information by class of
derivative instrument for derivative instruments categorized as trading or other
than trading:



(a)  The fair value amounts for OTC positions are based on various indices or
     dealer quotes. The fair value amounts for currency contracts are based on
     dealer quotes of forward prices covering the remaining duration of the
     forward exchange contract. The exchange-traded futures contracts and
     certain option contracts do not have a corresponding fair value since
     changes in the market prices are settled on a daily basis.
(b)  The aggregate average fair value of all trading activities for the period
     ending December 31, 1999, was $3 million. Detail by class of instrument
     was not available.
(c)  Contract or notional amounts do not quantify risk exposure, but are used
     in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts. The contract
     or notional amounts do not reflect the extent to which positions may
     offset one another.
(d)  Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $11
     million and $23 million and for liabilities of $(17) million and $(20)
     million, respectively.
(e)  The OTC swap arrangements vary in duration with certain contracts extending
     into 2008.
(f)  Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $11
     million and $29 million and for liabilities of $(5) million and $(38)
     million, respectively.
(g)  Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $5
     million and for liabilities of $(1) million and $(2) million, respectively.
(h)  The forward exchange contracts relating to USX's foreign operations have
     various maturities ending in December 2000.

26. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                        Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein
                        is not necessarily representative of the amount that
                        could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value
                        amount consider the tax consequences of realization or
                        settlement. The following table summarizes financial
                        instruments, excluding derivative financial instruments
                        disclosed in Note 25, by individual balance sheet
                        account:



                             Fair value of financial instruments classified as
                        current assets or liabilities approximates carrying
                        value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
                        Fair value of investments and long-term receivables was
                        based on discounted cash flows or other specific
                        instrument analysis. Fair value of preferred stock of
                        subsidiary and trust preferred securities was based on
                        market prices. Fair value of long-term debt instruments
                        was based on market prices where available or current
                        borrowing rates available for financings with similar
                        terms and maturities.
                             USX's unrecognized financial instruments consist of
                        receivables sold in 1998 and financial guarantees. It is
                        not practicable to estimate the fair value of these
                        forms of financial instrument obligations because there
                        are no quoted market prices for transactions which are
                        similar in nature. For details relating to financial
                        guarantees, see Note 27.

27. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
                        USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending
                        or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                        commitments involving a variety of matters, including
                        laws and regulations relating to the environment.
                        Certain of these matters are discussed below. The
                        ultimate resolution of these contingencies could,
                        individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
                        consolidated financial statements. However, management
                        believes that USX will remain a viable and competitive
                        enterprise even though it is possible that these
                        contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

                        ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -
                             USX is subject to federal, state, local and foreign
                        laws and regulations relating to the environment. These
                        laws generally provide for control of pollutants
                        released into the environment and require responsible
                        parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste
                        disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for
                        noncompliance. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, accrued
                        liabilities for remediation totaled $170 million and
                        $145 million, respectively. It is not presently possible
                        to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs
                        that might be incurred or the penalties that may be
                        imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain
                        states, under programs to assist companies in cleanup
                        efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail
                        marketing outlets, were $52 million at December 31,
                        1999, and $41 million at December 31, 1998.
                             For a number of years, USX has made substantial
                        capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into
                        compliance with various laws relating to the
                        environment. In 1999 and 1998, such capital expenditures
                        totaled $78 million and $132 million, respectively. USX
                        anticipates making additional such expenditures in the
                        future; however, the exact amounts and timing of such
                        expenditures are uncertain because of the continuing
                        evolution of specific regulatory requirements.
                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, accrued liabilities
                        for platform abandonment and dismantlement totaled $152
                        million and $141 million, respectively.


                                                                            U-27





                        GUARANTEES -
                             Guarantees of the liabilities of affiliated
                        entities by USX and its consolidated subsidiaries
                        totaled $219 million at December 31, 1999, and $212
                        million at December 31, 1998. In the event that any
                        defaults of guaranteed liabilities occur, USX has access
                        to its interest in the assets of most of the affiliates
                        to reduce potential losses resulting from these
                        guarantees. As of December 31, 1999, the largest
                        guarantee for a single affiliate was $131 million.
                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, USX's pro rata share
                        of obligations of LOOP LLC and various pipeline
                        affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency
                        agreements totaled $146 million and $164 million,
                        respectively. Under the agreements, USX is required to
                        advance funds if the affiliates are unable to service
                        debt. Any such advances are prepayments of future
                        transportation charges.

                        COMMITMENTS -
                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, contract commitments
                        to acquire property, plant and equipment and long-term
                        investments totaled $568 million and $812 million,
                        respectively.
                             USX entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
                        in 1993, which requires USX to accept pulverized coal
                        each month or pay a minimum monthly charge of
                        approximately $1 million. Charges for deliveries of
                        pulverized coal totaled $23 million in both 1999 and
                        1998. If USX elects to terminate the contract early, a
                        maximum termination payment of $102 million, which
                        declines over the duration of the agreement, may be
                        required.
                             USX is a party to a 15-year transportation services
                        agreement with a natural gas transmission company. The
                        contract requires USX to pay a minimum annual demand
                        charge of approximately $5 million starting in the year
                        2000 and concluding in the year 2014. The payments are
                        required even if the transportation facility is not
                        utilized.

ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES
       The following estimates of net reserves have been determined by
deducting royalties of various kinds from USX's gross reserves. The reserve
estimates are believed to be reasonable and consistent with presently known
physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs and are subject
to change as additional knowledge concerning the reservoirs becomes
available. The estimates include only such reserves as can reasonably be
classified as proved; they do not include reserves which may be found by
extension of proved areas or reserves recoverable by secondary or tertiary
recovery methods unless these methods are in operation and are showing
successful results. Undeveloped reserves consist of reserves to be recovered
from future wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where
relatively major expenditures will be required to realize production. USX did
not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves subject to long-term supply
agreements with foreign governments or authorities in which USX acts as
producer.

                        (a) Revised to exclude reserves attributable to a
                            pressure maintenance program for the Petronius field

                        STANDARDIZED  MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED  FUTURE NET CASH
                        FLOWS AND CHANGES THEREIN RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND
                        GAS RESERVES
                             Estimated discounted future net cash flows and
                        changes therein were determined in accordance with
                        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69.
                        Certain information concerning the assumptions used in
                        computing the valuation of proved reserves and their
                        inherent limitations are discussed below. USX believes
                        such information is essential for a proper understanding
                        and assessment of the data presented.
                             FUTURE CASH INFLOWS are computed by applying
                        year-end prices of oil and gas relating to USX's proved
                        reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves.
                        Future price changes are considered only to the extent
                        provided by contractual arrangements in existence at
                        year-end.
                             The assumptions used to compute the proved reserve
                        valuation do not necessarily reflect USX's expectations
                        of actual revenues to be derived from those reserves nor
                        their present worth. Assigning monetary values to the
                        estimated quantities of reserves, described on the
                        preceding page, does not reduce the subjective and
                        ever-changing nature of such reserve estimates.
                             Additional subjectivity occurs when determining
                        present values because the rate of producing the
                        reserves must be estimated. In addition to uncertainties
                        inherent in predicting the future, variations from the
                        expected production rate also could result directly or
                        indirectly from factors outside of USX's control, such
                        as unintentional delays in development, environmental
                        concerns, changes in prices or regulatory controls.
                             The reserve valuation assumes that all reserves
                        will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves
                        are sold in place or subjected to participation by
                        foreign governments, additional economic considerations
                        also could affect the amount of cash eventually
                        realized.
                             FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS, including
                        abandonment and dismantlement costs, are computed by
                        estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing
                        and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end
                        of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
                        continuation of existing economic conditions.
                             FUTURE INCOME TAX EXPENSES are computed by applying
                        the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with
                        consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to
                        the future pretax net cash flows relating to USX's
                        proved oil and gas reserves. Permanent differences in
                        oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are
                        recognized.
                             DISCOUNT was derived by using a discount rate of 10
                        percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net
                        cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS



                  USX Corporation ("USX") is a diversified company engaged
              primarily in the energy business through its Marathon Group,
              and in the steel business through its U. S. Steel Group.

                  Effective October 31, 1997, USX sold Delhi Gas Pipeline
              Corporation and other subsidiaries of USX that comprised all of
              the USX - Delhi Group ("Delhi Companies"). On January 26, 1998,
              USX used the $195 million net proceeds from the sale to redeem
              all of the 9.45 million outstanding shares of USX - Delhi Group
              Common Stock. For additional information, see Note 5 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  During 1997, Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon") and Ashland
              Inc. ("Ashland") agreed to combine the major elements of their
              refining, marketing and transportation ("RM&T") operations. On
              January 1, 1998, Marathon transferred certain RM&T net assets to
              Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP"), a new consolidated
              subsidiary. Also on January 1, 1998, Marathon acquired certain
              RM&T net assets from Ashland in exchange for a 38 percent
              interest in MAP. Financial measures such as revenues, income
              from operations and capital expenditures in 1999 and 1998
              include 100 percent of MAP and are not comparable to prior
              period amounts. Income from continuing operations, net income
              and related per share amounts for 1999 and 1998 are net of the
              minority interest. For further discussion of MAP and pro forma
              information, see Note 3 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements.

                  On August 11, 1998, Marathon acquired Tarragon Oil and Gas
              Limited ("Tarragon"), a Canadian oil and gas exploration and
              production company. The purchase price included $686 million in
              cash payments, the assumption of $345 million in debt and the
              issuance of Exchangeable Shares of an indirect Canadian
              subsidiary of Marathon valued at $29 million. The Exchangeable
              Shares are exchangeable at any time on a one-for-one basis for
              shares of USX - Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock").
              On November 4, 1998, USX sold 17 million shares of Marathon
              Stock. The proceeds to USX of $528 million, were used to reduce
              indebtedness incurred to fund the Tarragon acquisition.
              Financial measures such as revenues, income from operations and
              capital expenditures in 1999 and 1998 include operations of
              Marathon Canada Limited, formerly known as Tarragon, commencing
              August 12, 1998. For further discussion of Tarragon and pro
              forma information, see Note 3 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements.

                  Certain sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis
              include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events
              potentially affecting USX. These statements typically contain
              words such as "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "expects"
              or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain.
              In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private
              Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are
              accompanied by cautionary language identifying important
              factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could
              cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth
              in the forward-looking statements. For additional risk factors
              affecting the businesses of USX, see Supplementary Data -

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME


                  REVENUES for each of the last three years are summarized in
             the following table:


              (a) Consists of sales, dividend and affiliate income, gain on
                  ownership change in MAP, net gains on disposal of assets
                  and other income.
              (b) Effective October 31, 1997, USX sold the Delhi Companies.
                  Excludes revenues of the Delhi Companies, which have been
                  classified as discontinued operations for 1997.
              (c) Included in both revenues and costs and expenses for the
                  Marathon Group and USX Consolidated, resulting in no effect
                  on income.

                  Adjusted revenues increased by $1,606 million in 1999
              compared with 1998, reflecting an 18 percent increase for the
              Marathon Group, partially offset by a 15 percent decrease for
              the U. S. Steel Group. Adjusted revenues increased by $3,049
              million in 1998 compared with 1997, reflecting a 34 percent
              increase for the Marathon Group, partially offset by a 9 percent
              decrease for U. S. Steel Group. For further discussion, see
              Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations by Group,
              herein.

                  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS for each of the last three years are
              summarized in the following table:


                  Income from operations increased $346 million in 1999
              compared with 1998 and decreased $188 million in 1998 compared
              with 1997. The increase in 1999 was mainly attributable to
              higher income for the Marathon Group mainly due to higher
              worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices. Income from operations for
              the U. S. Steel Group declined in 1999 due primarily to a $49
              per ton decrease in average realized prices related to the high
              levels of imports and weak tubular markets that continued in
              1999. For further discussion, see Management's Discussion and
              Analysis of Operations by Group, herein.

                  NET INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS for each of the last
              three years are summarized in the following table:


              (a) In December 1996, USX issued $117 million in aggregate
                  principal amount of 6-3/4% Notes Due February 1, 2000
                  ("indexed debt"), mandatorily exchangeable at maturity for
                  common stock of RTI International Metals, Inc. ("RTI") or
                  for the equivalent amount of cash, at USX's option. The
                  carrying value of indexed debt was adjusted quarterly to
                  settlement value based on changes in the value of RTI common
                  stock. Any resulting adjustment was charged or credited to
                  income and included in interest and other financial costs.
                  In 1999, USX irrevocably deposited with a trustee the RTI
                  common stock resulting in satisfaction of USX's obligation.
                  For further information see Note 8 to the USX Consolidated
                  Financial Statements.

                   Excluding the effect of the adjustment to the carrying
              value of indexed debt, net interest and other financial costs
              increased by $52 million in 1999 compared with 1998, and
              decreased by $34 million in 1998 compared with 1997. The
              increase in 1999 was primarily due to lower interest income and
              increased financial costs as a result of higher average debt
              levels. The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to increased
              interest income levels and increased capitalized interest on
              exploration and production projects, partially offset by
              increased interest costs resulting from higher average debt
              levels. For additional information, see Note 7 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  The PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES was $349 million
              in 1999, compared with $315 million in 1998 and $450 million in
              1997. The 1999 provision included a $23 million favorable
              adjustment to deferred taxes for the Marathon Group related to
              the outcome of a United States Tax Court case. The 1998 income
              tax provision included $33 million of favorable income tax
              accrual adjustments relating to foreign operations. For
              reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to total provisions
              on income from continuing operations, see Note 12 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS in 1997 reflects after
              tax income of the Delhi Group. Income in 1997 included an $81
              million gain on disposal of the Delhi Companies (net of income
              taxes). For additional discussion, see Note 5 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  EXTRAORDINARY LOSS of $7 million, net of income tax benefit,
              in 1999 included a $5 million loss resulting from the
              satisfaction of the indexed debt and a $2 million loss that was
              USX's share of Republic Technologies International, LLC's
              extraordinary loss related to the early extinquishment of debt.
              For additional information, see Note 8 to the USX Consolidated
              Financial Statements.

                  NET INCOME was $698 million in 1999, $674 million in 1998
              and $988 million in 1997. Excluding the gain on change of
              ownership in MAP in 1999 and 1998, the effects of the $81
              million gain on disposal related to discontinued operations in
              1997, and adjustments to the inventory market valuation reserve
              in each of 1999, 1998 and 1997, net income decreased by $152
              million in 1999 compared with 1998, and decreased by $462
              million in 1998 compared with 1997.

                  NONCASH CREDIT FROM EXCHANGE OF PREFERRED STOCK was $10
              million, or 12 cents per share of Steel Stock, in 1997. In
              May 1997, USX exchanged 3.9 million 6.75% Convertible Quarterly
              Income Preferred Securities ("Trust Preferred Securities") of
              USX Capital Trust I for an equivalent number of


                                                                           U-41





              shares of its outstanding 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
              Stock ("6.50% Preferred Stock"). The $10 million noncash credit
              reflects the difference between the carrying value of the 6.50%
              Preferred Stock and the fair value of the Trust Preferred
              Securities at the date of the exchange. For additional
              information, see Note 23 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND
LIQUIDITY


                  CURRENT ASSETS increased by $1,771 million from year-end
              1998, primarily reflecting increased receivables as the result
              of higher commodity prices and the expiration of the U. S.
              Steel Group's accounts receivable program. Inventories increased
              by $619 million largely due to the reversal of the market
              valuation reserve for oil inventories. For further discussion of
              the inventory market valuation reserve, see Note 17 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  CURRENT LIABILITIES increased by $697 million from year-end
              1998, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable reflecting
              higher year-end commodity prices for the Marathon Group and the
              impact of costs associated with higher production levels in the
              latter part of 1999 compared with the same 1998 period for the
              U. S. Steel Group, partially offset by a decrease in notes
              payable.

                  NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT decreased by $120 million
              from year-end 1998, primarily due to depreciation,
              reclassifications to assets held for disposal and asset sales,
              including Scurlock Permian LLC and Carnegie Natural Gas Company
              and affiliated subsidiaries, partially offset by the acquisition
              of certain Ultramar Diamond Shamrock ("UDS") assets and the
              purchase of Kobe Steel, Ltd.'s 50% membership interest in Lorain
              Tubular Company LLC.

                  TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE increased by $147
              million from year-end 1998, mainly reflecting borrowings for the
              U. S. Steel Group accounts receivables facility, the addition of
              the 6.65% Notes due 2006 and an increase in commercial paper
              borrowings partially offset by a decrease in revolving credit
              agreements and notes payable. For further discussion of the U. S.
              Steel Group accounts receivable facility, see Note 16 to the USX
              Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY increased by $451 million from year-end
              1998 mainly reflecting net income of $698 million, partially
              offset by dividends paid.

                  NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES was $1,936
              million in 1999, $2,022 million in 1998 and $1,464 million in
              1997. Cash provided from operating activities in 1999 included
              a $320 million payment resulting from the expiration of the
              U. S. Steel Group's accounts receivable program and a $20
              million payment to fund the Voluntary Employee Benefit
              Association Trust ("VEBA"). Cash provided from operating
              activities in 1998 included proceeds of $38 million for the
              insurance litigation settlement pertaining to the 1995 Gary
              Works #8 blast furnace explosion. Cash provided from operating
              activities in 1997 included a payment of $390 million resulting
              from termination of a Marathon Group and Delhi Group accounts
              receivable sales program, payments of $199 million to fund
              employee benefit plans related to the U. S. Steel Group, and
              insurance recoveries of $40 million related to a 1996 hearth
              breakout at the Gary Works No. 13 blast furnace. Excluding the
              effects of these adjustments, cash provided from operating
              activities increased by $292 million in 1999 compared with 1998
              primarily due to favorable working capital changes. Cash
              provided from operating activities decreased by $29 million in
              1998 compared with 1997, primarily due to lower net income and
              unfavorable working capital changes.


U-42





                  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES for each of the last three years are
              summarized in the following table:



                  Marathon Group's domestic exploration and production capital
              expenditures in 1999 mainly included the completion of Green
              Canyon Blocks 112 and 113 ("Angus") and additional development
              at South Pass 89 in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas
              developments in East Texas and other gas basins throughout the
              western United States. International exploration and production
              projects included the completion of the Tchatamba South
              development located offshore Gabon and oil and natural gas
              developments in Canada. Refining, marketing and transportation
              capital expenditures by MAP consisted of the acquisition of
              certain UDS assets in Michigan, upgrades and expansions of
              retail marketing outlets, refinery modifications and expansion
              and enhancement of logistic systems.

                  U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures in 1999 included
              the completion of the new 64" pickle line at Mon Valley Works;
              the replacement of three coilers at the Gary hot strip mill; an
              upgrade to the Mon Valley cold rolling mill; replacement of coke
              battery thruwalls at Gary Works; several projects at Gary Works
              allowing for production of high strength steel, primarily for the
              automotive market; and completion of the conversion of the
              Fairfield pipemill to use rounds instead of square blooms.

                  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2000 are expected to be approximately
              $1.6 billion. Expenditures for the Marathon Group are expected to
              be approximately $1.4 billion. Domestic exploration and
              development projects planned for 2000 include completion of the
              Petronius development in the Gulf of Mexico, various producing
              property acquisitions and continued natural gas developments in
              East Texas and other gas basins throughout the western United
              States. International exploration and development projects
              include the Tchatamba West development, located offshore Gabon
              and continued oil and natural gas developments in Canada.
              Refining, marketing and transportation spending by MAP will
              primarily consist of upgrades and expansions of retail marketing
              outlets, refinery improvements, including the delayed coker unit
              project at the Garyville refinery, and expansion and enhancement
              of logistic systems.

                  Capital expenditures for the U. S. Steel Group in 2000 are
              expected to be approximately $230 million. Planned projects
              include continued coke battery thruwall repairs at Gary Works,
              installation of the remaining two coilers at Gary's hot strip
              mill, a blast furnace stove replacement at Gary Works and a Mon
              Valley cold mill upgrade.

                  INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES of $74 million in 1999 mainly
              reflected development spending for the Sakhalin II project in
              Russia and the investment in Republic Technologies International,
              Inc.

                  In 2000, net investments in affiliates are expected to be
              approximately $100 million. Projected investments include
              continued development of the Sakhalin II project.

                  Contract commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment
              and long-term investments at December 31, 1999, totaled $568
              million compared with $812 million at December 31, 1998.


                                                                           U-43





                  The above statements with respect to capital expenditures
              and investments are forward-looking statements reflecting
              management's best estimates based on information currently
              available. To the extent this information proves to be
              inaccurate, the timing and levels of future expenditures and
              investments could differ materially from those included in the
              forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause future
              capital expenditures and investments to differ materially
              include changes in industry supply and demand, general economic
              conditions, the availability of business opportunities and
              levels of cash flow from operations for each of the Groups. The
              timing of completion or cost of particular capital projects
              could be affected by unforeseen hazards such as weather
              conditions, explosions or fires, or by delays in obtaining
              government or partner approval. In addition, levels of
              investments may be affected by the ability of equity affiliates
              to obtain third-party financing.

                  PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS were $366 million in 1999,
              compared with $86 million in 1998 and $481 million in 1997.
              Proceeds in 1999 primarily reflected the Marathon Group's sales
              of Scurlock Permian LLC, over 150 non-strategic domestic and
              international production properties and Carnegie Natural Gas
              Company and affiliated subsidiaries. Proceeds in 1997 included
              $361 million resulting from USX's entry into a strategic
              partnership with two limited partners to acquire an interest in
              three coke batteries at its U. S. Steel Group's Clairton Works
              and $15 million from the sale of the plate mill at the U. S.
              Steel Group's former Texas Works.

                  The net change in RESTRICTED CASH was a net deposit of $1
              million in 1999, compared with a net withdrawal of $174 million
              in 1998 and a net deposit of $97 million in 1997. The $174
              million net withdrawal in 1998 was primarily the result of
              redeeming all of the outstanding shares of USX - Delhi Group
              Common Stock with the $195 million of net proceeds from the sale
              of the Delhi Companies that had been classified as restricted
              cash in 1997. The net deposit of $97 million in 1997 mainly
              represents the deposit of the $195 million of net proceeds from
              the sale of the Delhi Companies, partially offset by cash
              withdrawn from an interest-bearing escrow account established in
              1996 in connection with the disposal of oil production
              properties in Alaska.

                  REPAYMENTS OF LOANS AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES were $1
              million in 1999 compared with $71 million in 1998 and $10 million
              in 1997. In 1998, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. repaid
              advances made by Marathon in connection with the Sakhalin II
              project.

                  FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS (the net of commercial paper and
              revolving credit arrangements, debt borrowings and repayments on
              the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) increased $187 million
              in 1999, compared with an increase of $315 million in 1998 and a
              decrease of $734 million in 1997. The increase in 1999 reflects
              the net effects of net cash provided from operating activities,
              net cash used in investing activities, distributions to minority
              shareholder of MAP and dividends paid. The increase in 1998 was
              primarily the result of borrowings against revolving credit
              agreements to fund the acquisition of Tarragon. The decrease in
              financial obligations in 1997 primarily reflected cash flows
              provided from operating activities and asset sales in excess of
              cash used for capital expenditures and dividend payments (and
              with respect to 1997, in excess of $219 million of cash used for
              investments in affiliates).


U-44





                  Additions to long-term debt and the issuance of Trust
              Preferred Securities for each of the last three years is
              summarized in the following table:



              (a) In 1997, USX exchanged 3.9 million 6.75% Convertible
                  Quarterly Income Preferred Securities ("Trust Preferred
                  Securities") of USX Capital Trust I for an equivalent
                  number of shares of USX's 6.50% Cumulative Convertible
                  Preferred Stock. This was a noncash transaction. For
                  additional discussion, see Note 23 to the USX Consolidated
                  Financial Statements.
              (b) Issued to refinance an equivalent amount of environmental
                  improvement refunding bonds.

                  In the event of a change in control of USX, debt and lease
              obligations totaling $3,541 million at year-end 1999 may be
              declared immediately due and payable or required to be
              collateralized. See Notes 11 and 16 to the USX Consolidated
              Financial Statements.

                  DIVIDENDS PAID increased $12 million in 1999 compared with
              1998 and increased $26 million in 1998 compared with 1997. The
              increase in 1998 was due primarily to a two-cents-per-share
              increase in the quarterly Marathon Stock dividend rate effective
              January 1998.

              BENEFIT PLAN ACTIVITY

                  In 1999, USX contributed $20 million to the United
              Steelworkers of America ("USWA") VEBA. USX contributed $49
              million in 1997 to fund the U. S. Steel Group's principal
              pension plan for the 1996 plan year. Also in 1997, USX
              contributed $80 million for elective funding of retiree life
              insurance of union and nonunion participants, and $70 million
              to the VEBA. A total of $40 million of the $70 million VEBA
              contribution represented prefunding for the years 1998 and 1999.

              DEBT AND PREFERRED STOCK RATINGS

                  Standard & Poor's Corp. currently rates USX and Marathon
              senior debt as investment grade at BBB-. USX's subordinated debt
              and preferred stock are rated at BB+. Moody's Investors Services,
              Inc., following upgrades in June 1998, currently rates USX's and
              Marathon's senior debt as investment grade at Baa2, USX's
              subordinated debt at Baa3 and USX's preferred stock as Ba1. Duff
              & Phelps Credit Rating Co. currently rates USX's senior notes as

              LIQUIDITY

                  At December 31, 1999, USX had $300 million of borrowings
              against its $2,350 million long-term revolving credit agreements
              and commercial paper borrowings of $165 million. There were no
              borrowings against MAP revolving credit agreements at December 31,
              1999.

                  USX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf
              registration statement, which became effective October 20, 1999,
              that allows USX to offer and issue unsecured debt securities,
              common and preferred stock and warrants in an aggregate principal
              amount of up to $1 billion in one


                                                                           U-45






              or more separate offerings on terms to be determined at the time
              of sale. Including this shelf registration statement, USX had a
              total of $1.678 billion available under existing shelf
              registration statements at December 31, 1999.

                  USX management believes that its short-term and long-term
              liquidity is adequate to satisfy its obligations as of
              December 31, 1999, and to complete currently authorized capital
              spending programs. Future requirements for USX's business needs,
              including the funding of capital expenditures, debt maturities
              for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, and any amounts that may
              ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies (which are
              discussed in Note 27 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements), are expected to be financed by a combination of
              internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of stock,
              borrowings or other external financing sources.

                  USX management's opinion concerning liquidity and USX's
              ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options
              mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on
              currently available information. To the extent that this
              information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of
              financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the
              availability of financing include the performance of each Group
              (as indicated by levels of cash provided from operating
              activities and other measures), the state of the debt and equity
              markets, investor perceptions of past performance and
              expectations regarding future actions and performance, the
              overall U.S. financial climate, and, in particular, with respect
              to borrowings, levels of USX's outstanding debt and credit
              ratings by rating agencies. For a summary of long-term debt, see

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES


                  USX has incurred and will continue to incur substantial
              capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures
              as a result of environmental laws and regulations. To the extent
              these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
              reflected in the prices of USX's products and services, operating
              results will be adversely affected. USX believes that domestic
              competitors of the U. S. Steel Group and substantially all the
              competitors of the Marathon Group are subject to similar
              environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact
              on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors,
              including the age and location of its operating facilities,
              marketing areas, production processes and the specific products
              and services it provides.


U-46





                  The following table summarizes USX's environmental
              expenditures for each of the last three years(a):



              (a) Amounts for the Marathon Group are calculated based on
                  American Petroleum Institute survey guidelines. Amounts for
                  the U. S. Steel Group are based on previously established
                  U.S. Department of Commerce survey guidelines.
              (b) Amounts in 1999 and 1998 include 100% of MAP.
              (c) Amounts do not include noncash provisions recorded for
                  environmental remediation, but include spending charged
                  against such reserves, net of recoveries where permissible.

                  USX's environmental capital expenditures accounted for 5%,
              8% and 9% of total consolidated capital expenditures in 1999,
              1998 and 1997, respectively.

                  USX's environmental compliance expenditures averaged 1%, 1%
              and 2% of total consolidated costs in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
              respectively. Remediation spending primarily reflected ongoing
              clean-up costs for soil and groundwater contamination associated
              with underground storage tanks and piping at retail gasoline
              stations, and remediation activities at former and present
              operating locations.

                  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA")
              establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous
              wastes. Besides affecting current waste disposal practices, RCRA
              also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste
              disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation
              of storage tanks.

                  A significant portion of USX's currently identified
              environmental remediation projects relate to the remediation of
              former and present operating locations. These projects include
              continuing remediation at an IN SITU uranium mining operation,
              the remediation of former coke-making facilities, a closed and
              dismantled refinery site and the closure of permitted hazardous
              and non-hazardous waste landfills.

                  USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible
              party ("PRP") at 41 waste sites under the Comprehensive
              Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
              as of December 31, 1999. In addition, there are 20 sites where
              USX has received information requests or other indications that
              USX may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information
              is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability.
              There are also 142 additional sites, excluding retail gasoline
              stations, where remediation is being sought under other
              environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private
              parties are seeking remediation through discussions or
              litigation. Of these sites, 17 were associated with properties
              conveyed to MAP by Ashland for which Ashland has retained
              liability for all costs associated with remediation. At many of
              these sites, USX is one of a


                                                                           U-47





              number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as
              well as USX's share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the
              outcome of investigations and remedial studies. USX accrues for
              environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to
              remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
              reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation matters
              proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation
              obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued
              may be required. See Note 27 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements.

                  In October 1998, the National Enforcement Investigations
              Center and Region V of the United States Environmental Protection
              Agency ("EPA") conducted a multi-media inspection of MAP's
              Detroit refinery. Subsequently, in November 1998, Region V
              conducted a multi-media inspection of MAP's Robinson refinery.
              These inspections covered compliance with the Clean Air Act
              (New Source Performance Standards, Prevention of Significant
              Deterioration, and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous
              Air Pollutants for Benzene), the Clean Water Act (Permit
              exceedances for the Waste Water Treatment Plant), reporting
              obligations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to
              Know Act and the handling of process waste. Although MAP has been
              advised as to certain compliance issues regarding MAP's Detroit
              refinery, it is not known when complete findings on the results
              of the inspections will be issued. Thus far, MAP has been served
              with two Notices of Violation and three Findings of Violation in
              connection with the multi-media inspections at its Detroit
              refinery and one finding of violation at its Robinson refinery.
              The Detroit notices allege violations of the Michigan State
              Air Pollution Regulations, the EPA New Source Performance
              Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
              Pollutants for benzene. The Robinson notice alleges noncompliance
              with a general conduct provision as a result of acid-gas flaring
              since 1994. The Robinson refinery is alleged to have routine acid
              gas flaring arising from a failure to properly operate and
              maintain the sulfur recovery plant and amine units. MAP can
              contest the factual and legal basis for the allegations prior to
              the EPA taking enforcement action. At this time, it is not known
              when complete findings on the results of these multi-media
              inspections will be issued.

                  In 1998, USX entered into a consent decree with the EPA
              which resolved alleged violations of the Clean Water Act
              National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit
              at Gary Works and provides for a sediment remediation project
              for a section of the Grand Calumet River that runs through Gary
              Works. Contemporaneously, USX entered into a consent decree
              with the public trustees which resolves potential liability for
              natural resource damages on the same section of the Grand Calumet
              River. In 1999, USX paid civil penalties of $2.9 million for the
              alleged water act violations and $0.5 million in natural resource
              damages assessment costs. In addition, USX will pay the public
              trustees $1 million at the end of the remediation project for
              future monitoring costs and USX is obligated to purchase and
              restore several parcels of property that have been or will be
              conveyed to the trustees. During the negotiations leading up
              to the settlement with EPA, capital improvements were made to
              upgrade plant systems to comply with the NPDES requirements. The
              sediment remediation project is an approved final interim measure
              under the corrective action program for Gary Works and is
              expected to cost approximately $30 million over the next six
              years. Estimated remediation and monitoring costs for this
              project have been accrued.

                  New or expanded environmental requirements, which could
              increase USX's environmental costs, may arise in the future.
              USX intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the
              environment, but since many of them are not fixed or presently
              determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be
              affected by future legislation, it is not possible to predict
              accurately the ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation
              costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed.
              However, based on presently available information, and existing
              laws and regulations as currently implemented, USX does not
              anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures (including
              operating and maintenance and remediation) will materially
              increase in 2000. USX expects environmental capital expenditures
              in 2000 to be approximately $107 million, or approximately 6% of
              total estimated consolidated capital expenditures. Predictions
              beyond 2000 can


U-48





              only be broad-based estimates which have varied, and will
              continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific
              regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more
              stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies,
              among other matters. Based upon currently identified projects,
              USX anticipates that environmental capital expenditures in 2001
              will total approximately $71 million; however, actual
              expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental
              projects are revised as a result of improved technology or
              changes in regulatory requirements, and could increase if
              additional projects are identified or additional requirements
              are imposed.

                  USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
              threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving
              a variety of matters. The ultimate resolution of these
              contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be
              material to the consolidated financial statements. However,
              management believes that USX will remain a viable and competitive
              enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies
              could be resolved unfavorably.

              OUTLOOK AND YEAR 2000

                  For Outlook with respect to the Marathon Group and U. S.
              Steel Group, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of
              Operations by Group, herein.

                  For discussion of Year 2000 as it affects the Marathon Group
              and the U. S. Steel Group, see Management's Discussion and
              Analysis of Operations by Group, herein.

              ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
              Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting
              for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"(SFAS No. 133).
              This new Standard requires recognition of all derivatives as
              either assets or liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 133 may
              result in additional volatility in both current period earnings
              and other comprehensive income as a result of recording
              recognized and unrecognized gains and losses resulting from
              changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. The
              transition adjustment resulting from adoption of SFAS No. 133
              will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in
              accounting principle.

                  Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to designate
              certain derivative instruments as hedges even if the strategy
              qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. This approach would
              eliminate the administrative effort needed to measure
              effectiveness and monitor such instruments; however, this
              approach also may result in additional volatility in current
              period earnings.

                  USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adoption either
              on financial position or results of operations. It is not
              possible to estimate what effect this Statement will have on
              future results of operations, although greater period-to-period
              volatility is likely. USX plans to adopt the Standard effective
              January 1, 2001.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS BY GROUP

              THE MARATHON GROUP

                  The Marathon Group includes Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon")
              and certain other subsidiaries of USX Corporation ("USX"), which
              are engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil
              and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation
              of petroleum products primarily through Marathon Ashland
              Petroleum LLC ("MAP"), owned 62 percent by Marathon; and other
              energy related businesses. The Management's Discussion and
              Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Marathon Group's
              Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements.


                                                                           U-49





                  The Marathon Group's 1999 financial performance was primarily
              affected by the strong recovery in worldwide liquid hydrocarbon
              prices. During 1999, Marathon focused on the acquisition of
              assets with a strong strategic fit, the disposal of non-core
              properties and workforce reductions through a voluntary early
              retirement program. Marathon also achieved a significant
              milestone when oil production commenced from the
              Piltun-Astokhskoye field offshore Sakhalin Island in the Russian
              Far East region on July 5, 1999.

              Marathon Group REVENUES for each of the last three years are
              summarized in the following table:



              (a) Amounts in 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of MAP.
              (b) Includes domestic natural gas and crude oil marketing and
                  transportation, and power generation.
              (c) Represents in 1999 net losses on certain asset sales.

                  E&P segment revenues increased by $1,209 million in 1999
              from 1998 following a decrease of $44 million in 1998 from 1997.
              The increase in 1999 was primarily due to higher worldwide
              liquid hydrocarbon prices, increased domestic liquid hydrocarbon
              production and higher E&P crude oil buy/sell volumes. The
              decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower worldwide liquid
              hydrocarbon prices and lower domestic natural gas prices,
              partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes.

                  RM&T segment revenues increased by $1,068 million in 1999
              from 1998, mainly due to higher refined product prices,
              increased volumes of refined product sales and higher merchandise
              sales, partially offset by reduced crude oil sales revenues
              following the sale of Scurlock Permian LLC. Beginning in 1998,
              RM&T segment revenues include 100 percent of MAP revenues and
              are not comparable to prior periods.

                  Other energy related businesses segment revenues increased
              by $479 million in 1999 from 1998 following a decrease of $69
              million in 1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily
              due to increased crude oil and natural gas purchase and resale
              activity. The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower prices
              associated with natural gas resale activity.

              Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                  Marathon Group INCOME FROM OPERATIONS for each of the last
              three years is summarized in the following table:



              (a) Amounts in 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of MAP.
              (b) Includes the portion of the Marathon Group's administrative
                  costs not charged to the operating segments and the portion
                  of USX corporate general and administrative costs allocated
                  to the Marathon Group.
              (c) The inventory market valuation ("IMV") reserve reflects the
                  extent to which the recorded LIFO cost basis of crude oil and
                  refined products inventories exceeds net realizable value.

                  Marathon Group Financial Statements.
              (d) The gain on ownership change and one-time transition charges
                  in 1998 relate to the formation of MAP. For additional
                  discussion of the gain on ownership change in MAP, see Note 5
                  to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.
              (e) Represents in 1999 an impairment of certain domestic
                  properties. Represents in 1998 a write-off of certain
                  non-revenue producing international investments and several
                  exploratory wells which had encountered hydrocarbons, but had
                  been suspended pending further evaluation. It also includes
                  in 1998 a gain from the resolution of a contract dispute
                  with a purchaser of Marathon's natural gas production from
                  certain domestic properties.
              (f) This represents a loss on the sale of Scurlock Permian LLC,
                  certain domestic production properties, Carnegie Natural Gas
                  Company and affiliated subsidiaries and certain Egyptian
                  properties.
              (g) Represents a fourth quarter pension settlement gain and
                  various benefit accruals resulting from favorable net gains
                  on retirement plan settlements and the voluntary early
                  retirement program.


                                                                           U-51





                  Income for reportable segments increased by $83 million in
              1999 from 1998, mainly due to higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon
              prices, partially offset by lower refined product margins.
              Beginning in 1998, income from operations includes 100 percent of
              MAP, and Marathon Canada Limited (formerly known as Tarragon)
              results of operations commencing August 12, 1998. On an unaudited
              pro forma basis, assuming the acquisitions of Ashland's RM&T net
              assets and Tarragon's operations had occurred on January 1, 1997,
              income for reportable segments for 1997 would have been $1,728
              million. Income for reportable segments decreased by $521 million
              in 1998 from pro forma 1997, mainly due to lower worldwide liquid
              hydrocarbon prices, lower domestic natural gas prices and lower
              refining crack spreads, partially offset by higher liquid
              hydrocarbon production.

              AVERAGE VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES


              (a)  Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
              (b)  Represents equity tanker liftings, truck deliveries and
                   direct deliveries.
              (c)  Represents  Marathon's  equity  interest in Sakhalin
                   Energy  Investment  Company  Ltd. ("Sakhalin Energy") and
                   CLAM Petroleum B.V. ("CLAM").
              (d)  Represents gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale.
              (e)  Represents Marathon's equity interest in CLAM.
              (f)  Prices exclude gains/losses from hedging activities, equity
                   affiliates and purchase/resale gas.
              (g)  In 1999 and 1998, refined products sold and matching buy/sell
                   volumes include 100 percent of MAP and are not comparable to
                   prior periods.

                  DOMESTIC E&P income increased by $304 million in 1999 from
              1998 following a decrease of $310 million in 1998 from 1997. The
              increase in 1999 was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon
              and natural gas prices, increased liquid hydrocarbon volumes
              resulting from new production in the Gulf of Mexico and lower
              exploration expense.

                  The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower liquid
              hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased
              liquid hydrocarbon production and natural gas volumes. The 17
              percent, or 20,000 barrels per day ("bpd"), increase in liquid
              hydrocarbon production was mainly attributable to new production
              in the Gulf of Mexico, while the increase in natural gas volumes
              was mainly attributable to properties in east Texas.


U-52





                  INTERNATIONAL E&P income increased by $36 million in 1999
              from 1998 following a decrease of $185 million in 1998 from
              1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily due to higher liquid
              hydrocarbon prices, partially offset by lower liquid
              hydrocarbon and natural gas production in Europe and higher
              exploration expense.

                  The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower liquid
              hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and higher exploration and
              operating expenses. These items were partially offset by
              increased liquid hydrocarbon production and natural gas
              volumes. The 24 percent, or 12,000 bpd, increase in liquid
              hydrocarbon production was mainly attributable to the acquired
              production in Canada and new production in Gabon. The increase
              in natural gas volumes was mainly attributable to acquired
              production in Canada.

                  RM&T segment income decreased by $285 million in 1999 from
              1998, primarily due to lower refined product margins, partially
              offset by recognized mark-to-market derivative gains, increased
              refined product sales volumes, higher merchandise sales at
              Speedway SuperAmerica LLC and the realization of additional
              operating efficiencies as a result of forming MAP.

                  Beginning in 1998, RM&T segment income includes 100 percent
              of MAP. On an unaudited pro forma basis, assuming the
              acquisition of Ashland's RM&T net assets had occurred on
              January 1, 1997, income for the reportable segments of the
              combined downstream operations of Marathon and Ashland for 1997
              would have been $869 million. On this basis, 1998 RM&T segment
              income of $896 million was slightly higher than pro forma 1997
              RM&T segment income. During 1998, the effects of lower refining
              crack spreads were offset by strong performances from MAP's
              asphalt and retail operations, realization of operating
              efficiencies as a result of combining Marathon and Ashland's
              downstream operations and lower energy costs.

                  OTHER ENERGY RELATED BUSINESSES segment income increased by
              $28 million in 1999 from 1998 following a decrease of $15
              million in 1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily
              due to higher equity earnings as a result of increased pipeline
              throughput and a reversal of abandonment accruals of $10
              million in 1999. The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to a
              gain on the sale of an equity interest in a domestic pipeline
              company included in 1997 segment income.

                  ITEM NOT ALLOCATED TO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: IMV reserve
              adjustment - When U. S. Steel Corporation acquired Marathon Oil
              Company in March 1982, crude oil and refined product prices
              were at historically high levels. In applying the purchase
              method of accounting, the Marathon Group's crude oil and
              refined product inventories were revalued by reference to
              current prices at the time of acquisition, and this became the
              new LIFO cost basis of the inventories. Generally accepted
              accounting principles require that inventories be carried at
              lower of cost or market. Accordingly, the Marathon Group has
              established an IMV reserve to reduce the cost basis of its
              inventories to net realizable value. Quarterly adjustments to
              the IMV reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income
              from operations.

                  When Marathon acquired the crude oil and refined product
              inventories associated with Ashland's RM&T operations on
              January 1, 1998, the Marathon Group established a new LIFO cost
              basis for those inventories. The acquisition cost of these
              inventories lowered the overall average cost of the Marathon
              Group's combined RM&T inventories. As a result, the price
              threshold at which an IMV reserve will be recorded was also
              lowered.

                  These adjustments affect the comparability of financial
              results from period to period as well as comparisons with other
              energy companies, many of which do not have such adjustments.
              Therefore, the Marathon Group reports separately the effects of
              the IMV reserve adjustments on financial results. In
              management's opinion, the effects of such adjustments should be
              considered separately when evaluating operating performance.

                  In 1999, the IMV reserve adjustment resulted in a credit to
              income from operations of $551 million compared to a charge of
              $267 million in 1998, or a change of $818 million. The
              favorable 1999 IMV reserve adjustment, which is almost entirely
              recorded by MAP, was primarily due to the significant increase
              in refined product prices experienced during 1999. For
              additional discussion of the IMV reserve, see Note 20 to the
              Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                                                                          U-53



              OUTLOOK - MARATHON GROUP

                  The outlook regarding the Marathon Group's upstream
              revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and
              volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Prices have
              historically been volatile and have frequently been affected by
              unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from
              fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political
              developments in the world's major oil and gas producing and
              consuming areas. Any significant decline in prices could have a
              material adverse effect on the Marathon Group's results of
              operations. A prolonged decline in such prices could also
              adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas
              reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of
              capital available for exploration and development.

                  In 2000, worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production, including
              Marathon's share of equity affiliates, is expected to increase
              from 1999, to average approximately 210,000 bpd. Most of the
              increase is anticipated in the second half of the year. This
              primarily reflects projected new production from the start-up
              of Petronius in the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter of 2000
              and one full ice-free season of production from the
              Piltun-Astokhskoye ("P-A") field in Russia, partially offset by
              natural production declines of mature fields. In 2001,
              worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production is expected to increase
              further to approximately 230,000 bpd. In 2000 and 2001,
              worldwide natural gas volumes, including Marathon's share of
              equity affiliates, are expected to average approximately 1.3
              billion cubic feet per day ("bcfd") and 1.4 bcfd, respectively.
              These projections are based on known discoveries and do not
              assume any new discoveries, acquisitions or dispositions.

                  Progress continues on the Petronius development in the
              deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 1999, efforts focused on
              rebuilding the lost platform deck module, which was dropped
              during installation in 1998. Third party insurance has covered
              substantially all rebuilding costs associated with this
              incident. The platform module is scheduled to be completed in
              the first quarter of 2000 and offshore installation should
              occur in the second quarter of 2000 with first production
              expected in the third quarter of 2000.

                  In September 1999, production commenced from the Angus
              field, a three-well subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico.
              In January 2000, Marathon sold its 33.34 percent interest in
              the Angus development and will report a pre-tax gain of
              approximately $85 million in the first quarter of 2000.
              Marathon's worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production forecasts
              discussed previously exclude estimated 2000 and 2001 production
              from the Angus field.

                  On January 21, 2000, the Poseidon pipeline, a subsea
              pipeline that transports Marathon's production from Ewing Bank
              873, was damaged by a ship's anchor and had to be shut-in. The
              pipeline was inoperable for approximately three weeks for
              repairs and resulted in no production from Ewing Bank during
              this period. Marathon does not expect this incident to have a
              material impact on the current year's operations.

                  Marathon has increased its presence in the Gulf of Mexico
              through extensive acquisition and analysis of 3-D seismic.
              Plans are to drill eight deepwater exploratory wells in 2000.
              To support this increased drilling activity, Marathon has
              contracted two new deepwater rigs, capable of drilling in water
              depths beyond 6,500 feet.

                  Marathon holds a 37.5 percent interest in Sakhalin Energy
              Investment Company Ltd. ("Sakhalin Energy"), an incorporated
              joint venture company responsible for the overall management of
              the Sakhalin II project. This project includes development of
              the P-A oil field and the Lunskoye gas-condensate field, which
              are located 8-12 miles offshore Sakhalin Island in the Russian
              Far East Region. The Russian State Reserves Committee has
              approved estimated combined reserves for the P-A and Lunskoye
              fields of 1 billion gross barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 14
              trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

U-54



                  In July 1999, oil production commenced from the P-A field
              and the first lifting occurred on September 20, 1999. In late
              September, production was shut-in following a failure of the
              mooring system and resumed only for brief periods during
              October and November before operations ceased for the winter in
              early December. A re-designed mooring system is expected to be
              installed in the second quarter of 2000 and production is
              expected to resume in June 2000, the beginning of the ice-free
              season. In 2000, gross production is expected to average 36,000
              gross bpd (on an annualized basis). Marathon's equity share of
              reserves from primary production in the Astokh Feature is 80
              million barrels of oil.

                  Further development of the P-A field continues, including
              plans to drill two appraisal and eight production wells in 2000
              and to commence waterflood activity for the Astokh Feature.
              With respect to the Lunskoye field, appraisal work and efforts
              to secure long term gas sales markets continue. Commencement of
              gas production from the Lunskoye field, which will be
              contingent upon the conclusion of a gas sales contract, is
              anticipated to occur in 2006 or later.

                  At December 31, 1999, Marathon's net investment in the
              Sakhalin II project was approximately $400 million.

                  Other major upstream projects, which are currently underway
              or under evaluation and are expected to improve future income
              streams, include the Mississippi Canyon Block 348 in the Gulf
              of Mexico, the Tchatamba West field, located offshore Gabon,
              and various North American natural gas fields.

                  In 2000, Marathon launched an initiative that targets $150
              million in annual, repeatable pre-tax operating efficiencies by
              year-end 2001. This initiative focuses on gaining measurable,
              hard-dollar improvements in revenues or expenses. Besides a
              goal to constrain production costs, this initiative includes
              strategic management of Marathon's portfolio of properties,
              allocation of personnel and resources to assets and activities
              with the greatest opportunity for return and growth, and the
              adoption of enterprise-wide tools (computerization and other
              new technology) to elevate workforce productivity.

                  The above discussion includes forward-looking statements
              with respect to worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production
              (including Russia for 2000) and natural gas volumes for 2000
              and 2001, commencement of projects and dates of initial
              production, Gulf of Mexico and Russia drilling programs, and
              the amount and timing of operating efficiencies. These
              statements are based on a number of assumptions, including
              (among others) prices, amount of capital available for
              exploration and development, worldwide supply and demand for
              petroleum products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates,
              production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing
              production from new wells, timing and results of future
              development drilling, drilling rig availability, reserve
              replacement rates, other geological, operating and economic
              considerations, and the ability to identify sufficient
              initiatives in order to generate efficiencies. In addition,
              development of new production properties in countries outside
              the United States may require protracted negotiations with host
              governments and is frequently subject to political
              considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely
              affect the timing and economics of projects. To the extent
              these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or negotiations and
              other considerations are not satisfactorily resolved, actual
              results could be materially different than present expectations.

                  Downstream income of the Marathon Group is largely
              dependent upon refined product margins, which reflect the
              difference between the selling prices of refined products and
              the cost of raw materials refined and manufacturing costs.
              Refined product margins have been historically volatile and
              vary with the level of economic activity in the various
              marketing areas, the regulatory climate, crude oil costs,
              manufacturing costs and the available supply of crude oil and
              refined products.

                                                                          U-55

              Ohio. ORPL is a common carrier pipeline company and the
              pipeline will be an interstate common carrier pipeline. The
              pipeline is expected to initially move about 50,000 bpd of
              refined petroleum into the central Ohio region. Construction is
              currently expected to begin in late 2000. However, the
              construction schedule is largely dependent on obtaining the
              necessary rights-of-way, of which over 86 percent have been
              obtained to date, and final regulatory approvals.

                  MAP is constructing a delayed coker unit at its Garyville,
              LA refinery. This unit will allow for the use of heavier, lower
              cost crude and eliminate the production of heavy fuel oil. To
              supply this new unit, MAP reached an agreement with P.M.I.
              Comercio Internacional, S.A. de C.V., (PMI), an affiliate of
              Petroleos Mexicanos, (PEMEX), to purchase approximately 90,000
              bpd of heavy Maya crude oil. This is a multi-year contract,
              which will begin upon completion of the delayed coker unit
              which is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2001. In addition,
              a project to increase crude throughput and light product output
              is being undertaken at MAP's Robinson, IL refinery and is also
              expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001.

                  The above statements with respect to pipeline and refinery
              improvement projects are forward looking statements. Some
              factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ
              materially from present expectations include (among others) the
              price of petroleum products, levels of cash flow from
              operations, obtaining the necessary construction and
              environmental permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather
              conditions, obtaining the necessary rights-of-way and
              regulatory approval constraints.

              YEAR 2000

                  The Marathon Group encountered only minor problems during
              the rollover to the Year 2000, none of which impacted
              operations. Most problems were quickly corrected, while the
              remaining problems were addressed by utilizing contingency
              plans to prevent any business disruptions.

                  Essentially all business processes and systems have been
              successfully operated since the rollover to the Year 2000.
              However, the possibility for Year 2000 problems still exists.
              Therefore, the Marathon Group plans to continue monitoring its
              business processes and systems to ensure dates and date-related
              information continue to be processed correctly.

                  Total costs associated with Year 2000 readiness were $36
              million, including $18 million of incremental costs.

              THE U. S. STEEL GROUP

                  The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, which is
              engaged in the production and sale of steel mill products,
              coke, and taconite pellets; the management of mineral
              resources; domestic coal mining; real estate development; and
              engineering and consulting services. Certain business
              activities are conducted through joint ventures and partially
              owned companies, such as USS-POSCO Industries ("USS-POSCO"),
              PRO-TEC Coating Company ("PRO-TEC"), Transtar, Inc.
              ("Transtar"), Clairton 1314B Partnership, Republic Technologies
              International, LLC ("Republic") and VSZ U. S. Steel, s. r.o.
              Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in
              conjunction with the U. S. Steel Group's Financial Statements
              and Notes to Financial Statements.

                            In 1999, segment income for U. S. Steel
              operations decreased primarily due to lower average steel
              product prices, unfavorable product mix, and lower income from
              affiliates.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTINUED

                  U. S. Steel Group REVENUES for each of the last three years
              are summarized in the following table.


           (a) Includes revenue from the sale of steel production by-products,
               engineering and consulting services, real estate development
               and resource management.

                  Total revenues decreased by $969 million in 1999 from 1998
               primarily due to lower average realized prices and lower income
               from affiliates, which included a $47 million charge for the
               impairment of U. S. Steel's investment in USS/Kobe Steel
               Company. Net gain on disposal of assets in 1999 included a $22
               million charge representing the difference between the carrying
               value of the investment in RTI International Metals, Inc.
               ("RTI") and the carrying value of indexed debt (for additional
               information, see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
               Statements). Total revenues in 1998 decreased by $658 million
               from 1997 primarily due to lower average realized prices, lower
               steel shipment volumes, and lower income from affiliates.

                  U. S. Steel Group INCOME FROM OPERATIONS for the U. S.
               Steel Group for the last three years was:


           (a) Includes income from the production and sale of steel mill
               products, coke and taconite pellets; the management of mineral
               resources; domestic coal mining; real estate development; and
               engineering and consulting services.
           (b) Includes the portion of postretirement benefit costs and
               certain other expenses principally attributable to former
               business units of the U. S. Steel Group. Results in 1997
               included charges of $9 million related to environmental
               accruals and the adoption of SOP 96-1.
           (c) For further details, see Note 7 to the U. S. Steel Group
               Financial Statements.

           (d) For further details, see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group
               Financial Statements.

               SEGMENT INCOME FOR U. S. STEEL OPERATIONS

                  U. S. Steel operations recorded a segment loss of
               $128 million in 1999 versus segment income of $330 million in
               1998, a decrease of $458 million. The 1999 segment loss
               included a $10 million charge for certain environmental
               accruals, a $7 million charge for certain legal accruals and $7
               million in various non-recurring equity affiliate charges.
               Results in 1998 included a net favorable $30 million for an
               insurance litigation settlement and charges of $10 million
               related to a voluntary workforce reduction plan. In addition to
               the effects of these items, the decrease in segment income in
               1999 for U. S. Steel operations was primarily due to lower
               average steel prices, lower income from raw materials
               operations, unfavorable product mix, higher pension costs and
               lower income from affiliates.

                                                                          U-57



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTINUED


                  High levels of imports and weak tubular markets continued
              to negatively affect steel product prices and steel shipment
              levels in 1999 as they did in 1998. U. S. Steel's average
              realized price declined 10% in 1999 compared to 1998 from $469
              per ton to $420 per ton. In 1999, raw steel capability
              utilization averaged 94%, compared to 88% in 1998 and 97% in
              1997.

                  Segment income for U. S. Steel operations in 1998 decreased
              $288 million from 1997. Segment income in 1998 and 1997
              included insurance recoveries of $30 million and $40 million,
              respectively, due to blast furnace incidents in 1995 and 1996
              at Gary Works. Results in 1997 included a $15 million gain on
              the sale of the plate mill at U. S. Steel's former Texas Works.
              In addition to the effects of these items, the decrease in
              segment income in 1998 for U. S. Steel operations was primarily
              due to lower average steel prices, lower shipments, less
              efficient operating levels, the cost effects of a 10 day outage
              at Gary Works No. 13 blast furnace following a tap hole
              failure, and lower income from affiliates. These unfavorable
              items were partially offset by lower 1998 accruals for profit
              sharing.

                  Segment income for U. S. Steel operations included pension
              costs (which are primarily noncash) allocated to the ongoing
              operations of U. S. Steel of $219 million, $187 million, and
              $169 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Pension
              costs in 1998 included $10 million for termination benefits
              associated to a voluntary early retirement program.

                  ITEM NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENT: Pension credits associated
              with pension plan assets and liabilities allocated to pre-1987
              retirees and former businesses are not included in segment
              income for U. S. Steel operations. These pension credits, which
              are primarily noncash, totaled $447 million in 1999, compared
              to $373 million and $313 million in 1998 and 1997,
              respectively. Pension credits in 1999 included $35 million for
              a one-time favorable pension settlement primarily related to
              the voluntary early retirement program for salaried employees.

                  Pension credits, combined with pension costs included in
              segment income for U. S. Steel operations, resulted in net
              pension credits of $228 million in 1999, $186 million in 1998
              and $144 million in 1997. Net pension credits are expected to
              be approximately $270 million in 2000. Also in 2000, U. S.
              Steel's main pension plans' transition asset will be fully
              amortized, decreasing the pension credit by $69 million
              annually in future years for this component. Future net pension
              credits can vary depending upon the market performance of plan
              assets, changes in actuarial assumptions regarding such factors
              as the selection of a discount rate and rate of return on plan
              assets, changes in the amortization levels of transition
              amounts or prior period service costs, plan amendments
              affecting benefit payout levels and profile changes in the
              beneficiary populations being valued. Changes in any of these
              factors could cause net pension credits to change. To the
              extent net pension credits decline in the future, income from
              operations would be adversely affected. For additional
              information on pensions, see Note 11 to the U. S. Steel Group
              Financial Statements.

              OUTLOOK FOR 2000 - U. S. STEEL GROUP

                  U. S. Steel expects that shipment volumes and average steel
              product prices to be higher in 2000 compared to 1999. In recent
              years, demand for steel in the United States has been at high
              levels. Any weakness in the United States economy for capital
              goods or consumer durables could further adversely impact U. S.
              Steel Group's product prices and shipment level.

                  Income from equity affiliates will be negatively impacted
              by losses associated with Republic. Republic has stated that it
              expects to incur operating losses through 2000 and nonrecurring
              charges associated with the consolidation of the combined
              operations. U. S. Steel will recognize its share of any such
              losses under the equity method of accounting.

                  In August 1999, members of the USWA ratified a new
              five-year labor contract. The new labor contract, which
              includes $2.00 in hourly wage increases phased in over the term
              of the agreement beginning in 2000 as well as pension and other
              benefit improvements for active and retired employees

U-58



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTINUED


              and spouses, will result in higher labor and benefit costs for
              the U. S. Steel Group each year throughout the term of the
              contract. Management believes that this agreement is
              competitive with labor agreements reached by U. S. Steel's
              major domestic integrated competitors and thus does not believe
              that U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to such
              competitors will be materially affected.

                  Steel imports to the United States accounted for an
              estimated 26%, 30% and 24% of the domestic steel market for the
              years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Steel imports of hot
              rolled and cold rolled steel decreased 34% in 1999, compared to
              1998. Steel imports of plates decreased 52% compared to 1998.
              For most products, U. S. Steel's order books are strong and
              prices are increasing. The trade cases have had a positive
              impact, however, high import levels remain a problem and will
              continue to affect the industry throughout the year.

                  The preceding statements concerning anticipated steel
              demand, steel pricing, and shipment levels are forward-looking
              and are based upon assumptions as to future product prices and
              mix, and levels of steel production capability, production and
              shipments. These forward-looking statements can be affected by
              imports, domestic and international economies, domestic
              production capacity, and customer demand. In the event these
              assumptions prove to be inaccurate, actual results may differ
              significantly from those presently anticipated.

              YEAR 2000

                  U. S. Steel experienced only nominal problems during the
              year-end rollover to the Year 2000, none of which impacted
              production operations. After a planned short pause in
              operations over the year-end rollover, facilities were
              restarted on schedule and full production quickly resumed.
              To-date, no Year 2000 related problems have been encountered
              with third-parties.

                  Substantially all processes and systems have been run
              successfully in production mode after the rollover; but until
              this is complete, there is a potential for Year 2000 related
              problems, especially for business systems. Accordingly, U. S.
              Steel plans to continue to closely monitor the processes and
              systems to ensure that dates and date-related information are
              accurately represented and displayed on all output.

                  Total costs associated with Year 2000 project for U. S.
              Steel were $28 million, including $17 million of incremental
              costs.

              ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
              issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
              133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
              Activities". This new standard requires recognition of all
              derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value. SFAS
              No. 133 may result in additional volatility in both current
              period earnings and other comprehensive income as a result of
              recording recognized and unrecognized gains and losses
              resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative
              instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from adoption
              of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a
              change in accounting principle.

                  Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to designate
              certain derivative instruments as hedges even if the strategy
              qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. This approach would
              eliminate the administrative effort needed to measure
              effectiveness and monitor such instruments; however, this
              approach also may result in additional volatility in current
              period earnings.

                  USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adoption on
              either the financial position or results of operations. It is
              not possible to estimate what effect this Statement will have
              on future results of operations, although greater
              period-to-period volatility is likely. USX plans to adopt the
              Standard effective January 1, 2001.

                                                                      U-59




              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

              MANAGEMENT OPINION CONCERNING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
                  USX uses commodity-based and foreign currency derivative
              instruments to manage its price risk. Management has authorized
              the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage
              exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase,
              production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined products,
              nonferrous metals and electricity. For transactions that
              qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses are
              deferred and subsequently recognized in income from operations,
              in the same period as the underlying physical transaction.
              Derivative instruments used for trading and other activities
              are marked-to-market and the resulting gains or losses are
              recognized in the current period in income from operations.
              While USX's risk management activities generally reduce market
              risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for
              raw material purchases and products sold, such activities can
              also encompass strategies that assume price risk.

                  Management believes that use of derivative instruments
              along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls
              does not expose USX to material risk. The use of derivative
              instruments could materially affect USX's results of operations
              in particular quarterly or annual periods. However, management
              believes that use of these instruments will not have a material
              adverse effect on financial position or liquidity. For a
              summary of accounting policies related to derivative
              instruments, see Note 1 to the USX Consolidated Financial
              Statements.

              COMMODITY PRICE RISK AND RELATED RISKS

                  In the normal course of its business, USX is exposed to
              market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase,
              production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined products
              and steel products. To a lesser extent, USX is exposed to the
              risk of price fluctuations on coal, coke, natural gas liquids,
              electricity, petroleum feedstocks and certain nonferrous metals
              used as raw materials. USX is also exposed to effects of price
              fluctuations on the value of its commodity inventories.

                  USX's market risk strategy has generally been to obtain
              competitive prices for its products and services and allow
              operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by
              supply and demand. However, USX uses fixed-price contracts and
              derivative commodity instruments to manage a relatively small
              portion of its commodity price risk. USX uses fixed-price
              contracts for portions of its natural gas production to manage
              exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices. In addition,
              USX uses derivative commodity instruments such as
              exchange-traded futures contracts and options, and
              over-the-counter ("OTC") commodity swaps and options to manage
              exposure to market risk related to the purchase, production or
              sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined products, certain
              nonferrous metals and electricity. For transactions that
              qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses are
              deferred and subsequently recognized in income from operations,
              in the same period as the underlying physical transaction.
              Derivative instruments used for trading and other activities
              are marked-to-market and the resulting gains or losses are
              recognized in the current period in income from operations.
              However, certain derivative commodity instruments have the
              effect of restoring the equity portion of fixed-price sales of
              natural gas to variable market-based pricing. These instruments
              are used as part of USX's overall risk management programs.

                  Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pretax
              income of hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in commodity prices
              for open derivative commodity instruments as of December 31,
              1999 and December 31, 1998, are provided in the following
              table:(a)



           (a)Gains and losses on derivative commodity
              instruments are generally offset by price changes in the
              underlying commodity. Effects of these offsets are not
              reflected in the sensitivity analyses. Amounts reflect the
              estimated incremental effect on pretax income of hypothetical
              10% and 25% changes in closing commodity prices for each open
              contract position at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.
              Marathon Group and U. S. Steel Group management evaluates their
              portfolios of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing
              basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated
              market conditions and changes in risk profiles. Changes to the
              portfolios subsequent to December 31, 1999, would cause future
              pretax income effects to differ from those presented in the
              table.
           (b)The number of net open contracts varied throughout 1999, from a
              low of 107 contracts at July 14, to a high of 34,199 contracts
              at April 16, and averaged 14,462 for the year. The derivative
              commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken also
              varied throughout 1999, and will continue to vary in the
              future. Because of these variations in the composition of the
              portfolio over time, the number of open contracts, by itself,
              cannot be used to predict future income effects.
           (c)The calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes
              that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated.
              Gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic
              value only.
           (d)The direction of the price change used in calculating the
              sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would
              result in the largest incremental decrease in pretax income
              when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to
              hedge that commodity.

                  While derivative commodity instruments are generally used
              to reduce risks from unfavorable commodity price movements,
              they also may limit the opportunity to benefit from favorable
              movements. In total, Marathon's exploration and production
              operations recorded net pretax other than trading activity
              gains of $3 million in 1999, losses of $3 million in 1998 and
              losses of $3 million in 1997.

                                                                          U-61



                  Marathon's refining, marketing and transportation
              operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to
              lock-in costs of certain raw material purchases, to protect
              carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on
              fixed-price sales of refined products. Marathon's refining,
              marketing and transportation operations recorded net pretax
              other than trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority
              interest in MAP, of approximately $8 million in 1999, $28
              million in 1998, and $29 million in 1997. Beginning in 1999,
              Marathon's refining, marketing and transportation operations
              used derivative instruments for trading activities and recorded
              net pretax trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority
              interest in MAP, of $5 million.

                  The U. S. Steel Group uses OTC commodity swaps to manage
              exposure to market risk related to the purchase of natural gas,
              heating oil and certain nonferrous metals. The U. S. Steel
              Group recorded net pretax other than trading activity losses of
              $4 million in 1999, losses of $6 million in 1998 and gains of
              $5 million in 1997. These gains and losses were offset by
              changes in the realized prices of the underlying hedged
              commodities.

                  For additional quantitative information relating to
              derivative commodity instruments, including aggregate contract
              values and fair values, where appropriate, see Note 25 to the
              USX Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  USX is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect
              the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in
              derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of
              the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are
              frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary
              from prices experienced in local markets. For example, New York
              Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") contracts for natural gas are
              priced at Louisiana's Henry Hub, while the underlying
              quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the
              Western United States at prices that do not move in strict
              correlation with NYMEX prices. To the extent that commodity
              price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions,
              derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the
              expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk.
              These regional price differences could yield favorable or
              unfavorable results. OTC transactions are being used to manage
              exposure to a portion of basis risk.

                  USX is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays
              in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability
              to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting
              position. Due to the large number of active participants,
              liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded
              transactions.

              INTEREST RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations
              on certain of its non-derivative financial instruments. A
              sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a
              hypothetical 10% decrease in year-end 1999 and 1998 interest
              rates on the fair value of USX's non-derivative financial
              instruments, is provided in the following table:


              (a)Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes
                 payable, accounts payable and accrued interest, approximate
                 carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in
                 interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the
                 instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded
                 from the table.
              (b)See Note 26 to the USX Consolidated Financial Statements.
              (c)Reflects, by class of financial instrument, the estimated
                 incremental effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in
                 interest rates at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998,
                 on the fair value of USX's non-derivative financial
                 instruments. For financial liabilities, this assumes a 10%
                 decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of USX's
                 long-term debt at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.
              (d)For additional information, see Note 14 to the USX
                 Consolidated Financial Statements.
              (e)Includes amounts due within one year.
              (f)Fair value was based on market prices where available, or
                 current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms
                 and maturities. For additional information, see Note 16 to
                 the USX Consolidated Financial Statements.
              (g) See Note 23 to the USX Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  At December 31, 1999, USX's portfolio of long-term debt was
              comprised primarily of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the
              fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects
              of interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is illustrated
              by the $164 million increase in the fair value of long-term
              debt assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates.
              However, USX's sensitivity to interest rate declines and
              corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio
              would unfavorably affect USX's results and cash flows only to
              the extent that USX elected to repurchase or otherwise retire
              all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices
              above carrying value.

              FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to
              anticipated revenues and operating costs, firm commitments for
              capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities
              denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. USX has not
              generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk.
              However, USX has made limited use of forward currency contracts
              to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations. At
              December 31, 1999, USX had open Canadian dollar forward
              purchase contracts with a total carrying value of approximately
              $52 million compared to $36 million at December 31, 1998. A 10%
              increase in the December 31, 1999, Canadian dollar to U.S.
              dollar forward rate, would result in a charge to income of
              approximately $5 million. Last year, a 10% increase in the
              December 31, 1998, Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward rate,
              would have resulted in a charge to income of $3 million.

                                                                          U-63



              SAFE HARBOR

                  USX's quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
              risk include forward-looking statements with respect to
              management's opinion about risks associated with USX's use of
              derivative instruments. These statements are based on certain
              assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply
              of and demand for crude oil, refined products, steel products
              and certain raw materials. To the extent that these assumptions
              prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to USX's
              hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in
              the forward-looking statements.

                     INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, AND
                     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK






              MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

              The accompanying financial statements of the Marathon Group are
              the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX Corporation
              (USX) in conformity with accounting principles generally
              accepted in the United States. They necessarily include some
              amounts that are based on best judgments and estimates. The
              Marathon Group financial information displayed in other
              sections of this report is consistent with these financial
              statements.

                   USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
              financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
              organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate
              division of responsibility and by communications programs aimed
              at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
              throughout the organization.

                   USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
              accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
              that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are
              reliable. Appropriate management monitors the system for
              compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
              effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In
              addition, as part of their audit of the financial statements,
              USX's independent accountants, who are elected by the
              stockholders, review and test the internal accounting controls
              selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in
              determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be
              applied.

                   The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the
              area of financial reporting and internal accounting control
              through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed solely of
              nonmanagement directors, regularly meets (jointly and
              separately) with the independent accountants, management and
              internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of
              its responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls
              and the consolidated and group financial statements.




              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

              To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

              In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements appearing
              on pages M-2 through M-20 present fairly, in all material
              respects, the financial position of the Marathon Group at
              December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations
              and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
              ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
              principles generally accepted in the United States. These
              financial statements are the responsibility of USX's
              management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
              these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
              our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
              standards generally accepted in the United States, which
              require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
              assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
              material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
              basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
              financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
              and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
              the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
              our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
              above.

                   The Marathon Group is a business unit of USX Corporation
              (as described in Note 1, page M-5); accordingly, the financial
              statements of the Marathon Group should be read in connection
              with the consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation.

                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

              After the redemption of the USX - Delhi Group stock on
              January 26, 1998, USX Corporation (USX) has two classes of
              common stock: USX - Marathon Group Common Stock (Marathon
              Stock) and USX - U. S. Steel Group Common Stock (Steel Stock),
              which are intended to reflect the performance of the Marathon
              Group and the U. S. Steel Group, respectively.

                  The financial statements of the Marathon Group include the
              financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
              the businesses of Marathon Oil Company (Marathon) and certain
              other subsidiaries of USX, and a portion of the corporate
              assets and liabilities and related transactions which are not
              separately identified with ongoing operating units of USX. The
              Marathon Group financial statements are prepared using the
              amounts included in the USX consolidated financial statements.
              For a description of the Marathon Group's operating segments,
              see Note 10.

                  Although the financial statements of the Marathon Group and
              the U. S. Steel Group separately report the assets, liabilities
              (including contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity of
              USX attributed to each such Group, such attribution of assets,
              liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
              stockholders' equity between the Marathon Group and the U. S.
              Steel Group for the purpose of preparing their respective
              financial statements does not affect legal title to such assets
              or responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of Marathon
              Stock and Steel Stock are holders of common stock of USX and
              continue to be subject to all the risks associated with an
              investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
              Financial impacts arising from one Group that affect the
              overall cost of USX's capital could affect the results of
              operations and financial condition of the other Group. In
              addition, net losses of either Group, as well as dividends and
              distributions on any class of USX Common Stock or series of
              preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX Common
              Stock or series of preferred stock at prices in excess of par
              or stated value, will reduce the funds of USX legally available
              for payment of dividends on both classes of Common Stock.
              Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information should
              be read in connection with the Marathon Group financial
              information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

              PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION - These financial
              statements include the accounts of the businesses comprising
              the Marathon Group. The Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
              Group financial statements, taken together, comprise all of the
              accounts included in the USX consolidated financial statements.

                  Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures,
              undivided interest pipelines and jointly owned gas processing
              plants are consolidated on a pro rata basis.

                  Investments in entities over which the Marathon Group has
              significant influence are accounted for using the equity method
              of accounting and are carried at the Marathon Group's share of
              net assets plus loans and advances.

                  Investments in companies whose stock is publicly traded are
              carried at market value. The difference between the cost of
              these investments and market value is recorded in other
              comprehensive income (net of tax). Investments in companies
              whose stock has no readily determinable fair value are carried
              at cost.

              USE OF ESTIMATES - Generally accepted accounting principles
              require management to make estimates and assumptions that
              affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
              disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and
              the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
              Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions
              include the carrying value of long-lived assets; valuation
              allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax
              assets; environmental liabilities; liabilities for potential
              tax deficiencies and potential litigation claims and
              settlements; and assets and obligations related to employee
              benefits. Additionally, certain estimated liabilities are
              recorded when management commits to a plan to close an
              operating facility or to exit a business activity. Actual
              results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

                                                                           M-5



              REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenues principally include sales,
              dividend and affiliate income, gains or losses on the disposal
              of assets and gains or losses from changes in ownership
              interests.

                  SALES - Sales are recognized when products are shipped or
                  services are provided to customers. Consumer excise taxes
                  on petroleum products and merchandise and matching crude
                  oil and refined products buy/sell transactions settled in
                  cash are included in both revenues and costs and expenses,
                  with no effect on income.

                  DIVIDEND AND AFFILIATE INCOME - Dividend and affiliate
                  income includes the Marathon Group's proportionate share of
                  income from equity method investments and dividend income
                  from other investments. Dividend income is recognized when
                  dividend payments are received.

                  DISPOSAL OF ASSETS - When long-lived assets depreciated on
                  an individual basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any
                  gains or losses are reflected in income. Gains on disposal
                  of long-lived assets are recognized when earned, which is
                  generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is
                  expected, such losses are recognized when long-lived assets
                  are reclassified as assets held for sale. Proceeds from
                  disposal of long-lived assets depreciated on a group basis
                  are credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and
                  amortization with no immediate effect on income.

                  GAS BALANCING - The Marathon Group follows the sales method
                  of accounting for gas production imbalances and would
                  recognize a liability if the existing proved reserves were
                  not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation.

                  CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP INTEREST - Gains or losses from a
                  change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary or an
                  unconsolidated affiliate are recognized in revenues in the
                  period of change.

              CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents include
              cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid
              debt instruments with maturities generally of three months or
              less.

              INVENTORIES - Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
              market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the
              last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

              DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - The Marathon Group uses
              commodity-based and foreign currency derivative instruments to
              manage its exposure to price risk. Management is authorized to
              use futures, forwards, swaps and options related to the
              purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined
              products and electricity. While the Marathon Group's risk
              management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due
              to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material
              purchases and products sold, such activities can also encompass
              strategies which assume price risk.

                  COMMODITY-BASED HEDGING TRANSACTIONS - For transactions that
                  qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses
                  are deferred and subsequently recognized in income from
                  operations, as a component of sales or cost of sales, in
                  the same period as the underlying physical transaction. To
                  qualify for hedge accounting, derivative positions cannot
                  remain open if the underlying physical market risk has been
                  removed. If such derivative positions remain in place, they
                  would be marked-to-market and accounted for as trading or
                  other activities. Recorded deferred gains or losses are
                  reflected within other current and noncurrent assets or
                  accounts payable and deferred credits and other
                  liabilities, as appropriate.

                  COMMODITY-BASED TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES -Derivative
                  instruments used for trading and other activities are
                  marked-to-market and the resulting gains or losses are
                  recognized in the current period within income from
                  operations. This category also includes the use of
                  derivative instruments that have no offsetting underlying
                  physical market risk.

                  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS - The Marathon Group uses
                  forward exchange contracts to manage currency risks. Gains
                  or losses related to firm commitments are deferred and
                  recognized concurrent with the underlying transaction. All
                  other gains or losses are recognized in income in the
                  current period as sales, cost of sales, interest income or
                  expense, or other income, as appropriate. Forward exchange
                  contracts are recorded as receivables or payables, as
                  appropriate.

              EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT - The Marathon Group follows the
              successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
              exploration and development.

M-6



              LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas
              producing properties are computed using predetermined rates
              based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves applied on a
              units-of-production method. Other items of property, plant and
              equipment are depreciated principally by the straight-line
              method.

                  The Marathon Group evaluates impairment of its oil and gas
              producing assets primarily on a field-by-field basis using
              undiscounted cash flows based on total proved reserves. Other
              assets are evaluated on an individual asset basis or by logical
              groupings of assets. Assets deemed to be impaired are written
              down to their fair value, including any related goodwill, using
              discounted future cash flows and, if available, comparable
              market values.

              ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES - The Marathon Group provides for
              remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to
              remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
              reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of remediation
              accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
              the commitment to a formal plan of action. Remediation
              liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known
              environmental exposure and are discounted in certain instances.
              If recoveries of remediation costs from third parties are
              probable, a receivable is recorded. Estimated abandonment and
              dismantlement costs of offshore production platforms are
              accrued based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves on a
              units-of-production method.

              INSURANCE - The Marathon Group is insured for catastrophic
              casualty and certain property and business interruption
              exposures, as well as those risks required to be insured by law
              or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured losses are charged
              against income upon occurrence.

              RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications of prior years'
              data have been made to conform to 1999 classifications.

3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

              Effective January 1, 1997, USX adopted American Institute of
              Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. 96-1,
              "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP 96-1), which
              provides additional interpretation of existing accounting
              standards related to recognition, measurement and disclosure of
              environmental remediation liabilities. As a result of adopting
              SOP 96-1, the Marathon Group identified additional
              environmental remediation liabilities of $11 million. Estimated
              receivables for recoverable costs related to adoption of SOP
              96-1 were $4 million. The net unfavorable effect of adoption on
              the Marathon Group's income from operations at January 1, 1997,
              was $7 million.

                  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
              issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
              "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
              (SFAS No. 133). This new Standard requires recognition of all
              derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value. SFAS
              No. 133 may result in additional volatility in both current
              period earnings and other comprehensive income as a result of
              recording recognized and unrecognized gains and losses
              resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative
              instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from adoption
              of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a
              change in accounting principle.

                  Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to designate
              certain derivative instruments as hedges even if the strategy
              qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. This approach would
              eliminate the administrative effort needed to measure
              effectiveness and monitor such instruments; however, this
              approach also may result in additional volatility in current
              period earnings.

                  USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adoption on
              either the financial position or results of operations. It is
              not possible to estimate what effect this Statement will have
              on future results of operations, although greater
              period-to-period volatility is likely. USX plans to adopt the
              Standard effective January 1, 2001.

                                                                           M-7


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

              FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES - As a matter of policy, USX manages most
              financial activities on a centralized, consolidated basis. Such
              financial activities include the investment of surplus cash;
              the issuance, repayment and repurchase of short-term and
              long-term debt; the issuance, repurchase and redemption of
              preferred stock; and the issuance and repurchase of common
              stock. Transactions related primarily to invested cash,
              short-term and long-term debt (including convertible debt),
              related net interest and other financial costs, and preferred
              stock and related dividends are attributed to the Marathon
              Group, the U. S. Steel Group and, prior to November 1, 1997,
              the Delhi Group based upon the cash flows of each group for the
              periods presented and the initial capital structure of each
              group. Most financing transactions are attributed to and
              reflected in the financial statements of all groups. See Note
              9, for the Marathon Group's portion of USX's financial
              activities attributed to all groups. However, transactions such
              as leases, certain collaterized financings, certain indexed
              debt instruments, financial activities of consolidated entities
              which are less than wholly owned by USX and transactions
              related to securities convertible solely into any one class of
              common stock are or will be specifically attributed to and
              reflected in their entirety in the financial statements of the
              group to which they relate.

              CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS - Corporate general
              and administrative costs are allocated to the Marathon Group,
              the U. S. Steel Group and, prior to November 1, 1997, the Delhi
              Group based upon utilization or other methods management
              believes to be reasonable and which consider certain measures
              of business activities, such as employment, investments and
              sales. The costs allocated to the Marathon Group were $26
              million in 1999, $28 million in 1998 and $37 million in 1997,
              and primarily consist of employment costs including pension
              effects, professional services, facilities and other related
              costs associated with corporate activities.

              INCOME TAXES - All members of the USX affiliated group are
              included in the consolidated United States federal income tax
              return filed by USX. Accordingly, the provision for federal
              income taxes and the related payments or refunds of tax are
              determined on a consolidated basis. The consolidated provision
              and the related tax payments or refunds have been reflected in
              the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and, prior to
              November 1, 1997, the Delhi Group financial statements in
              accordance with USX's tax allocation policy. In general, such
              policy provides that the consolidated tax provision and related
              tax payments or refunds are allocated among the Marathon Group,
              the U. S. Steel Group and, prior to November 1, 1997, the Delhi
              Group, for group financial statement purposes, based
              principally upon the financial income, taxable income, credits,
              preferences and other amounts directly related to the
              respective groups.

                  For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax benefits
              resulting from attributes (principally net operating losses and
              various tax credits), which cannot be utilized by one of the
              groups on a separate return basis but which can be utilized on
              a consolidated basis in that year or in a carryback year, are
              allocated to the group that generated the attributes. To the
              extent that one of the groups is allocated a consolidated tax
              attribute which, as a result of expiration or otherwise, is not
              ultimately utilized on the consolidated tax return, the prior
              years' allocation of such attribute is adjusted such that the
              effect of the expiration is borne by the group that generated
              the attribute. Also, if a tax attribute cannot be utilized on a
              consolidated basis in the year generated or in a carryback
              year, the prior years' allocation of such consolidated tax
              effects is adjusted in a subsequent year to the extent
              necessary to allocate the tax benefits to the group that would
              have realized the tax benefits on a separate return basis. As a
              result, the allocated group amounts of taxes payable or
              refundable are not necessarily comparable to those that would
              have resulted if the groups had filed separate tax returns.

5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

              In August 1998, Marathon acquired Tarragon Oil and Gas Limited
              (Tarragon), a Canadian oil and gas exploration and production
              company. Securityholders of Tarragon received, at their
              election, Cdn$14.25 for each Tarragon share, or the economic
              equivalent in Exchangeable Shares of an indirect Canadian
              subsidiary of Marathon, which are exchangeable solely on a
              one-for-one basis into Marathon Stock. The purchase price
              included cash payments of $686 million, issuance of 878,074
              Exchangeable Shares valued at $29 million and the assumption of
              $345 million in debt.

                  The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of
              the holder at any time and automatically redeemable on August
              11, 2003 (and, in certain circumstances, as early as August 11,
              2001). The holders of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to
              receive declared dividends equivalent to dividends declared
              from time to time by USX on Marathon Stock.

                  Marathon accounted for the acquisition using the purchase
              method of accounting. The 1998 results of operations include
              the operations of Marathon Canada Limited, formerly known as
              Tarragon, commencing August 12, 1998.

M-8



                  During 1997, Marathon and Ashland Inc. (Ashland) agreed to
              combine the major elements of their refining, marketing and
              transportation (RM&T) operations. On January 1, 1998, Marathon
              transferred certain RM&T net assets to Marathon Ashland
              Petroleum LLC (MAP), a new consolidated subsidiary. Also on
              January 1, 1998, Marathon acquired certain RM&T net assets from
              Ashland in exchange for a 38% interest in MAP. The acquisition
              was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
              purchase price was determined to be $1.9 billion, based upon an
              external valuation. The change in Marathon's ownership interest
              in MAP resulted in a gain of $245 million, which is included in
              1998 revenues. In accordance with MAP closing agreements,
              Marathon and Ashland made capital contributions to MAP for
              environmental improvements. The closing agreements stipulate
              that ownership interests in MAP will not be adjusted as a
              result of such contributions. Accordingly, Marathon recognized
              a gain on ownership change of $17 million in 1999.

                  In connection with the formation of MAP, Marathon and
              Ashland entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement
              dated January 1, 1998 (the LLC Agreement). The LLC Agreement
              provides for an initial term of MAP expiring on December 31,
              2022 (25 years from its formation). The term will automatically
              be extended for ten-year periods, unless a termination notice
              is given by either party.

                  Also in connection with the formation of MAP, the parties
              entered into a Put/Call, Registration Rights and Standstill
              Agreement (the Put/Call Agreement). The Put/Call Agreement
              provides that at any time after December 31, 2004, Ashland will
              have the right to sell to Marathon all of Ashland's ownership
              interest in MAP, for an amount in cash and/or Marathon or USX
              debt or equity securities equal to the product of 85% (90% if
              equity securities are used) of the fair market value of MAP at
              that time, multiplied by Ashland's percentage interest in MAP.
              Payment could be made at closing, or at Marathon's option, in
              three equal annual installments, the first of which would be
              payable at closing. At any time after December 31, 2004,
              Marathon will have the right to purchase all of Ashland's
              ownership interests in MAP, for an amount in cash equal to the
              product of 115% of the fair market value of MAP at that time,
              multiplied by Ashland's percentage interest in MAP.

                  The following unaudited pro forma data for the Marathon
              Group includes the results of operations of Tarragon for 1998
              and 1997, and the Ashland RM&T net assets for 1997, giving
              effect to the acquisitions as if they had been consummated at
              the beginning of the years presented. The pro forma data is
              based on historical information and does not necessarily
              reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it
              necessarily indicative of future results of operations.



             (a) Excluding the pro forma inventory market valuation
                 adjustment, pro forma net income would have been $383
                 million in 1998 and $619 million in 1997. Reported net
                 income, excluding the reported inventory market valuation
                 adjustment, would have been $414 million in 1998 and $635
                 million in 1997.

6. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MAP AND ASHLAND

              At December 31, 1999 and 1998, MAP had current receivables from
              Ashland of $26 million and $22 million, respectively, and
              current payables to Ashland of $2 million at December 31, 1999,
              and at December 31, 1998, $106 million, including distributions
              payable.

                   At December 31, 1998, MAP's cash and cash equivalents
              included a $103 million demand note invested with Ashland,
              which was repaid in January 1999.

                   MAP has a $190 million short-term revolving credit
              agreement with Ashland. Interest on borrowings is based on the
              Federal Funds Rate in effect each day during the period plus
              0.30 of 1%. At December 31, 1999, there were no borrowings
              against this facility.

                   During 1999 and 1998, MAP's sales to Ashland consisting
              primarily of petroleum products, were $198 million and $185
              million, respectively, and MAP's purchases of products and
              services from Ashland were $25 million and $45 million,
              respectively. These transactions were conducted under terms
              comparable to those with unrelated parties.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. SEGMENT INFORMATION

              The Marathon Group's operations consist of three reportable
              operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production - explores
              for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide
              basis; 2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation - refines,
              markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products,
              primarily in the Midwest and southeastern United States through
              MAP; and 3) Other Energy Related Businesses. Other Energy
              Related Businesses is an aggregation of two segments which fall
              below the quantitative reporting thresholds: 1) Natural Gas and
              Crude Oil Marketing and Transportation - markets and transports
              its own and third-party natural gas and crude oil in the United
              States; and 2) Power Generation - develops, constructs and
              operates independent electric power projects worldwide.

                        (a)See Note 16, to the USX consolidated financial
                           statements for details of interest rates, maturities

14. PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

                        The Marathon Group has noncontributory defined benefit
                        pension plans covering substantially all employees.
                        Benefits under these plans are based primarily upon
                        years of service and final average pensionable earnings.
                        Certain subsidiaries provide benefits for employees
                        covered by other plans based primarily upon employees'
                        service and career earnings.
                             The Marathon Group also has defined benefit retiree
                        health and life insurance plans (other benefits)
                        covering most employees upon their retirement. Health
                        benefits are provided through comprehensive hospital,
                        surgical and major medical benefit provisions or through
                        health maintenance organizations, both subject to
                        various cost sharing features. Life insurance benefits
                        are provided to certain nonunion and most union
                        represented retiree beneficiaries primarily based on
                        employees' annual base salary at retirement. Other
                        benefits have not been prefunded.





                        (a)Includes 1999 voluntary early retirement program.

M-14




                             For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of
                        increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
                        benefits was assumed for 2000. The rate was assumed to
                        decrease gradually to 5% for 2006 and remain at that
                        level thereafter.
                             A one-percentage-point change in assumed health
                        care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

15. DIVIDENDS

                        In accordance with the USX Restated Certificate of
                        Incorporation, dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel
                        Stock are limited to the legally available funds of USX.
                        Net losses of either Group, as well as dividends and
                        distributions on any class of USX Common Stock or series
                        of preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX
                        Common Stock or series of preferred stock at prices in
                        excess of par or stated value, will reduce the funds of
                        USX legally available for payment of dividends on both
                        classes of Common Stock. Subject to this limitation, the
                        Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends
                        on the Marathon Stock based on the financial condition
                        and results of operations of the Marathon Group,
                        although it has no obligation under Delaware law to do
                        so. In making its dividend decisions with respect to
                        Marathon Stock, the Board of Directors considers among
                        other things, the long-term earnings and cash flow
                        capabilities of the Marathon Group as well as the
                        dividend policies of similar publicly traded energy
                        companies.

16. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT



                             Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 1999,
                        includes gross assets acquired under capital leases of
                        $20 million with no related amounts in accumulated
                        depreciation, depletion and amortization.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



                        (a) See page U-7 of the USX consolidated financial
                           statements relative to the annual activity of these
                           adjustments and gains (losses). Total comprehensive
                           income for the Marathon Group for the years 1999,
                           1998 and 1997 was $660 million, $306 million and $457
                           million, respectively.

                                                                          M-15

18. INCOME TAXES

                        Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities
                        attributed to the Marathon Group are determined in
                        accordance with the USX group tax allocation policy
                        (Note 4).
                             Provisions (credits) for estimated income taxes
                             were:



                             A reconciliation of federal statutory tax rate
                             (35%) to total provisions follows:



                             Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from
                             the following:



                        (a)USX expects to generate sufficient future taxable
                           income to realize the benefit of the Marathon Group's
                           deferred tax assets. In addition, the ability to
                           realize the benefit of foreign tax credits is based
                           upon certain assumptions concerning future operating
                           conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil
                           prices), income generated from foreign sources and
                           USX's tax profile in the years that such credits may
                           be claimed.
                             The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years
                        1990 through 1997 are under various stages of audit and
                        administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has
                        made adequate provision for income taxes and interest
                        which may become payable for years not yet settled.
                             Pretax income (loss) included $66 million, $(75)
                        million and $250 million attributable to foreign sources
                        in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
                             Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated
                        foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 1999, amounted to
                        $150 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
                        taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because the
                        Marathon Group intends to permanently reinvest such
                        earnings in those foreign operations. If such earnings
                        were not permanently reinvested, a deferred tax
                        liability of $53 million would have been required.

19. INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES



                             Summarized financial information of affiliates
                        accounted for by the equity method of accounting
                        follows:



                             Dividends and partnership  distributions  received
                        from equity  affiliates were $44 million in 1999, $23
                        million in 1998 and $21 million in 1997.
                             Marathon Group purchases from equity affiliates
                        totaled $50 million, $64 million and $37 million in
                        1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Marathon Group sales
                        to USX equity affiliates were $22 million in 1999 and
                        1998 and $36 million in 1997.

20. INVENTORIES



                             Inventories of crude oil and refined products are
                        valued by the LIFO method. The LIFO method accounted for
                        90% and 88% of total inventory value at December 31,
                        1999 and 1998, respectively. Current acquisition costs
                        were estimated to exceed the above inventory values at
                        December 31, 1999, by approximately $200 million.
                             The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the
                        extent that the recorded LIFO cost basis of crude oil
                        and refined products inventories exceeds net realizable
                        value. The reserve is decreased to reflect increases in
                        market prices and inventory turnover and increased to
                        reflect decreases in market prices. Changes in the
                        inventory market valuation reserve result in noncash
                        charges or credits to costs and expenses.

21. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AND STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

                        USX Stock-Based Compensation Plans and Stockholder
                        Rights Plan are discussed in Note 19, and Note 21,
                        respectively, to the USX consolidated financial
                        statements.
                             The Marathon Group's actual stock-based
                        compensation expense (credit) was $(4) million in 1999,
                        $(3) million in 1998 and $20 million in 1997.
                        Incremental compensation expense, as determined under a
                        fair value model, was not material ($.02 or less per
                        share for all years presented). Therefore, pro forma net
                        income and earnings per share data have been omitted.

                                                                          M-17

22. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                        The method of calculating net income per share for the
                        Marathon Stock, the Steel Stock and, prior to November
                        1, 1997, the Delhi Stock reflects the USX Board of
                        Directors' intent that the separately reported earnings
                        and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group
                        and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                        USX Restated Certificate of Incorporation, are available
                        for payment of dividends to the respective classes of
                        stock, although legally available funds and liquidation
                        preferences of these classes of stock do not necessarily
                        correspond with these amounts.
                             Basic net income per share is based on the weighted
                        average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net
                        income per share assumes conversion of convertible
                        securities for the applicable periods outstanding and
                        assumes exercise of stock options, provided in each
                        case, the effect is not antidilutive.

23. INTERGROUP TRANSACTIONS

                        SALES AND PURCHASES - Marathon Group sales to other
                        groups totaled $41 million, $21 million and $105 million
                        in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Marathon Group
                        purchases from other groups totaled $17 million in 1999,
                        $2 million in 1998 and $18 million in 1997. At December
                        31, 1999 and 1998, Marathon Group receivables included
                        $5 million and $3 million, respectively, related to
                        transactions with the U. S. Steel Group. These
                        transactions were conducted under terms comparable to
                        those with unrelated parties. Since October 31, 1997,
                        transactions with the Delhi Companies are third-party
                        transactions.

                        INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE FROM/PAYABLE TO THE U. S. STEEL
                        GROUP - At December 31, 1999 and 1998, amounts
                        receivable or payable for income taxes were included in
                        the balance sheet as follows:


                             These amounts have been determined in accordance
                        with the tax allocation policy described in Note 4.
                        Amounts classified as current are settled in cash in the
                        year succeeding that in which such amounts are accrued.
                        Noncurrent amounts represent estimates of intergroup tax
                        effects of certain issues for years that are still under
                        various stages of audit and administrative review. Such
                        tax effects are not settled between the groups until the
                        audit of those respective tax years is closed. The
                        amounts ultimately settled for open tax years will be
                        different than recorded noncurrent amounts based on the
                        final resolution of all of the audit issues for those
                        years.

24. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

                        The Marathon Group remains at risk for possible changes
                        in the market value of the derivative instrument;
                        however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes
                        in the underlying hedged item. The Marathon Group is
                        also exposed to credit risk in the event of
                        nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness
                        of counterparties is subject to continuing review,
                        including the use of master netting agreements to the
                        extent practical, and full performance is anticipated.
                             The following table sets forth quantitative
                        information by class of derivative instrument:

M-18



(a) The fair value amounts for OTC positions are based on various indices or
    dealer quotes. The fair value amounts for currency contracts are based on
    dealer quotes of forward prices covering the remaining duration of the
    forward exchange contract. The exchange-traded futures contracts and certain
    option contracts do not have a corresponding fair value since changes in the
    market prices are settled on a daily basis.
(b) The aggregate average fair value of all trading activities for the period
    ending December 31, 1999, was $3 million. Detail by class of instrument was
    not available.
(c) Contract or notional amounts do not quantify risk exposure, but are used in
    the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts. The contract or
    notional amounts do not reflect the extent to which positions may offset one
    another.
(d) Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $11
    million and $23 million and for liabilities of $(17) million and $(20)
    million, respectively.
(e) The OTC swap arrangements vary in duration with certain contracts extending
    into 2008.
(f) Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $8
    million and $29 million and for liabilities of $(5) million and $(31)
    million, respectively.
(g) Includes fair values as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, for assets of $5
    million and for liabilities of $(1) million and $(2) million, respectively.
(h) The forward exchange contracts relating to USX's foreign operations have
    various maturities ending in December 2000.

25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                        Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein
                        is not necessarily representative of the amount that
                        could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value
                        amount consider the tax consequences of realization or
                        settlement. The following table summarizes financial
                        instruments, excluding derivative financial instruments
                        disclosed in Note 24, by individual balance sheet
                        account. As described in Note 4, the Marathon Group's
                        specifically attributed financial instruments and the
                        Marathon Group's portion of USX's financial instruments
                        attributed to all groups are as follows:


                                                                           M-19



                             Fair value of financial instruments classified as
                        current assets or liabilities approximates carrying
                        value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
                        Fair value of investments and long-term receivables was
                        based on discounted cash flows or other specific
                        instrument analysis. Fair value of preferred stock of
                        subsidiary was based on market prices. Fair value of
                        long-term debt instruments was based on market prices
                        where available or current borrowing rates available for
                        financings with similar terms and maturities.

                             The Marathon Group's unrecognized financial
                        instruments consist of financial guarantees. It is not
                        practicable to estimate the fair value of these forms of
                        financial instrument obligations because there are no
                        quoted market prices for transactions which are similar
                        in nature. For details relating to financial guarantees,
                        see Note 26.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

                        USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending
                        or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                        commitments relating to the Marathon Group involving a
                        variety of matters, including laws and regulations
                        relating to the environment. Certain of these matters
                        are discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these
                        contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                        be material to the Marathon Group financial statements.
                        However, management believes that USX will remain a
                        viable and competitive enterprise even though it is
                        possible that these contingencies could be resolved
                        unfavorably to the Marathon Group.

                        ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -

                             The Marathon Group is subject to federal, state,
                        local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
                        environment. These laws generally provide for control of
                        pollutants released into the environment and require
                        responsible parties to undertake remediation of
                        hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed
                        for noncompliance. At December 31, 1999 and 1998,
                        accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $69 million
                        and $48 million, respectively. It is not presently
                        possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all
                        remediation costs that might be incurred or the
                        penalties that may be imposed. Receivables for
                        recoverable costs from certain states, under programs to
                        assist companies in cleanup efforts related to
                        underground storage tanks at retail marketing outlets,
                        were $52 million at December 31, 1999, and $41 million
                        at December 31, 1998.

                             For a number of years, the Marathon Group has made
                        substantial capital expenditures to bring existing
                        facilities into compliance with various laws relating to
                        the environment. In 1999 and 1998, such capital
                        expenditures totaled $46 million and $83 million,
                        respectively. The Marathon Group anticipates making
                        additional such expenditures in the future; however, the
                        exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
                        uncertain because of the continuing evolution of
                        specific regulatory requirements.

                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, accrued liabilities
                        for platform abandonment and dismantlement totaled $152
                        million and $141 million, respectively.

                        GUARANTEES -

                             Guarantees by USX and its consolidated subsidiaries
                        of the liabilities of affiliated entities of the
                        Marathon Group totaled $131 million at December 31, 1999
                        and 1998. As of December 31, 1999, the largest guarantee
                        for a single affiliate was $131 million.

                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Marathon Group's
                        pro rata share of obligations of LOOP LLC and various
                        pipeline affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency
                        agreements totaled $146 million and $164 million,
                        respectively. Under the agreements, the Marathon Group
                        is required to advance funds if the affiliates are
                        unable to service debt. Any such advances are
                        prepayments of future transportation charges.

                        COMMITMENTS -

                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Marathon Group's
                        contract commitments to acquire property, plant and
                        equipment and long-term investments totaled $485 million
                        and $624 million, respectively.

                             The Marathon Group is a party to a 15-year
                        transportation services agreement with a natural gas
                        transmission company. The contract requires the Marathon
                        Group to pay a minimum annual demand charge of
                        approximately $5 million starting in the year 2000 and
                        concluding in the year 2014. The payments are required
                        even if the transportation facility is not utilized.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                            The Marathon Group includes Marathon Oil Company
                        ("Marathon") and certain other subsidiaries of USX
                        Corporation ("USX"), which are engaged in worldwide
                        exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas;
                        domestic refining, marketing and transportation of
                        petroleum products primarily through Marathon Ashland
                        Petroleum LLC ("MAP"), owned 62 percent by Marathon; and
                        other energy related businesses. The Management's
                        Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction
                        with the Marathon Group's Financial Statements and Notes
                        to Financial Statements.

                            The Marathon Group's 1999 financial performance was
                        primarily affected by the strong recovery in worldwide
                        liquid hydrocarbon prices. During 1999, Marathon focused
                        on the acquisition of assets with a strong strategic
                        fit, the disposal of non-core properties and workforce
                        reductions through a voluntary early retirement program.
                        Marathon also achieved a significant milestone when oil
                        production commenced from the Piltun-Astokhskoye field
                        offshore Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East region
                        on July 5, 1999.

                            Certain sections of Management's Discussion and
                        Analysis include forward-looking statements concerning
                        trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of
                        the Marathon Group. These statements typically contain
                        words such as "anticipates", "believes", "estimates",
                        "expects", "targets" or similar words indicating that
                        future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance with "safe
                        harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
                        Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by
                        cautionary language identifying important factors,
                        though not necessarily all such factors, that could
                        cause future outcomes to differ materially from those
                        set forth in forward-looking statements. For additional

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME AND OPERATIONS

                        REVENUES for each of the last three years are summarized
                        in the following table:



                        Items included in both revenues and costs and expenses,
                        resulting in no effect on income:


                        (a) Amounts in 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of MAP.
                        (b) Includes domestic natural gas and crude oil
                            marketing and transportation, and power generation.
                        (c) Represents in 1999 net losses on certain asset
                            sales.



                                                                           M-25


                            E&P segment revenues increased by $1,209 million in
                        1999 from 1998 following a decrease of $44 million in
                        1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily due
                        to higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices, increased
                        domestic liquid hydrocarbon production and higher E&P
                        crude oil buy/sell volumes. The decrease in 1998 was
                        primarily due to lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon
                        prices and lower domestic natural gas prices, partially
                        offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes.

                            RM&T segment revenues increased by $1,068 million in
                        1999 from 1998, mainly due to higher refined product
                        prices, increased volumes of refined product sales and
                        higher merchandise sales, partially offset by reduced
                        crude oil sales revenues following the sale of Scurlock
                        Permian LLC. Beginning in 1998, RM&T segment revenues
                        include 100 percent of MAP revenues and are not
                        comparable to prior periods.

                            Other energy related businesses segment revenues
                        increased by $479 million in 1999 from 1998 following a
                        decrease of $69 million in 1998 from 1997. The increase
                        in 1999 was primarily due to increased crude oil and
                        natural gas purchase and resale activity. The decrease
                        in 1998 was primarily due to lower prices associated
                        with natural gas resale activity.

                            For additional discussion of revenues, see Note 10
                        to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                            INCOME FROM OPERATIONS for each of the last three
                        years is summarized in the following table:


                       (a) Amounts in 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of MAP.
                       (b) Includes the portion of the Marathon Group's
                           administrative costs not charged to the operating
                           segments and the portion of USX corporate general and
                           administrative costs allocated to the Marathon Group.
                       (c) The inventory market valuation ("IMV") reserve
                           reflects the extent to which the recorded LIFO cost
                           basis of crude oil and refined products inventories
                           exceeds net realizable value. For additional
                           discussion of the IMV, see Note 20 to the Marathon
                           Group Financial Statements.
                       (d) The gain on ownership change and one-time transition
                           charges in 1998 relate to the formation of MAP. For
                           additional discussion of the gain on ownership change
                           in MAP, see Note 5 to the Marathon Group Financial
                           Statements.
                       (e) Represents in 1999 an impairment of certain domestic
                           properties. Represents in 1998 a write-off of certain
                           non-revenue producing international investments and
                           several exploratory wells which had encountered
                           hydrocarbons, but had been suspended pending further
                           evaluation. It also includes in 1998 a gain from the
                           resolution of a contract dispute with a purchaser of
                           Marathon's natural gas production from
                           certain domestic properties.
                       (f) This represents a loss on the sale of Scurlock
                           Permian LLC, certain domestic production properties,
                           Carnegie Natural Gas Company and affiliated
                           subsidiaries and certain Egyptian properties.
                       (g) Represents a fourth quarter pension settlement gain
                           and various benefit accruals resulting from favorable
                           net gains on retirement plan settlements and the
                           voluntary early retirement program.

                            Income for reportable segments increased by $83
                        million in 1999 from 1998, mainly due to higher
                        worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices, partially offset by
                        lower refined product margins. Beginning in 1998, income
                        from operations includes 100 percent of MAP, and
                        Marathon Canada Limited (formerly known as Tarragon)
                        results of operations commencing August 12, 1998. On an
                        unaudited pro forma basis, assuming the acquisitions of
                        Ashland's RM&T net assets and Tarragon's operations had
                        occurred on January 1, 1997, income for reportable
                        segments for 1997 would have been $1,728 million. Income
                        for reportable segments decreased by $521 million in
                        1998 from pro forma 1997, mainly due to lower worldwide
                        liquid hydrocarbon prices, lower domestic natural gas
                        prices and lower refining crack spreads, partially
                        offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon production.


                        (a) Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas
                            liquids.
                        (b) Represents equity tanker liftings, truck deliveries
                            and direct deliveries.
                        (c) Represents  Marathon's  equity  interest in
                            Sakhalin  Energy  Investment  Company  Ltd.
                            ("Sakhalin Energy") and CLAM Petroleum B.V.
                            ("CLAM").
                        (d) Represents gas acquired for injection and
                            subsequent resale.
                        (e) Represents Marathon's equity interest in CLAM.
                        (f) Prices exclude gains/losses from hedging
                            activities, equity affiliates and purchase/resale
                            gas.
                        (g) In 1999 and 1998, refined products sold and
                            matching buy/sell volumes include 100 percent of
                            MAP and are not comparable to prior periods.

                            DOMESTIC E&P income increased by $304 million in
                        1999 from 1998 following a decrease of $310 million in
                        1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily due
                        to higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices,
                        increased liquid hydrocarbon volumes resulting from new
                        production in the Gulf of Mexico and lower exploration
                        expense.

                            The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower
                        liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, partially
                        offset by increased liquid hydrocarbon production and
                        natural gas volumes. The 17 percent, or 20,000 barrels
                        per day ("bpd"), increase in liquid hydrocarbon
                        production was mainly attributable to new production in
                        the Gulf of Mexico, while the increase in natural gas
                        volumes was mainly attributable to properties in east
                        Texas.

                            INTERNATIONAL E&P income increased by $36 million in
                        1999 from 1998 following a decrease of $185 million in
                        1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was primarily due
                        to higher liquid hydrocarbon prices, partially offset by
                        lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production in
                        Europe and higher exploration expense.

                                                                           M-27


                            The decrease in 1998 was primarily due to lower
                        liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and higher
                        exploration and operating expenses. These items were
                        partially offset by increased liquid hydrocarbon
                        production and natural gas volumes. The 24 percent, or
                        12,000 bpd, increase in liquid hydrocarbon production
                        was mainly attributable to the acquired production in
                        Canada and new production in Gabon. The increase in
                        natural gas volumes was mainly attributable to acquired
                        production in Canada.

                            RM&T segment income decreased by $285 million in
                        1999 from 1998, primarily due to lower refined product
                        margins, partially offset by recognized mark-to-market
                        derivative gains, increased refined product sales
                        volumes, higher merchandise sales at Speedway
                        SuperAmerica LLC and the realization of additional
                        operating efficiencies as a result of forming MAP.

                            Beginning in 1998, RM&T segment income includes 100
                        percent of MAP. On an unaudited pro forma basis,
                        assuming the acquisition of Ashland's RM&T net assets
                        had occurred on January 1, 1997, income for the
                        reportable segments of the combined downstream
                        operations of Marathon and Ashland for 1997 would have
                        been $869 million. On this basis, 1998 RM&T segment
                        income of $896 million was slightly higher than pro
                        forma 1997 RM&T segment income. During 1998, the effects
                        of lower refining crack spreads were offset by strong
                        performances from MAP's asphalt and retail operations,
                        realization of operating efficiencies as a result of
                        combining Marathon and Ashland's downstream operations
                        and lower energy costs.

                            OTHER ENERGY RELATED BUSINESSES segment income
                        increased by $28 million in 1999 from 1998 following a
                        decrease of $15 million in 1998 from 1997. The increase
                        in 1999 was primarily due to higher equity earnings as a
                        result of increased pipeline throughput and a reversal
                        of abandonment accruals of $10 million in 1999. The
                        decrease in 1998 was primarily due to a gain on the sale
                        of an equity interest in a domestic pipeline company
                        included in 1997 segment income.

                            ITEM NOT ALLOCATED TO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: IMV
                        RESERVE ADJUSTMENT - When U. S. Steel Corporation
                        acquired Marathon Oil Company in March 1982, crude oil
                        and refined product prices were at historically high
                        levels. In applying the purchase method of accounting,
                        the Marathon Group's crude oil and refined product
                        inventories were revalued by reference to current prices
                        at the time of acquisition, and this became the new LIFO
                        cost basis of the inventories. Generally accepted
                        accounting principles require that inventories be
                        carried at lower of cost or market. Accordingly, the
                        Marathon Group has established an IMV reserve to reduce
                        the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable
                        value. Quarterly adjustments to the IMV reserve result
                        in noncash charges or credits to income from operations.

                            When Marathon acquired the crude oil and refined
                        product inventories associated with Ashland's RM&T
                        operations on January 1, 1998, the Marathon Group
                        established a new LIFO cost basis for those inventories.
                        The acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the
                        overall average cost of the Marathon Group's combined
                        RM&T inventories. As a result, the price threshold at
                        which an IMV reserve will be recorded was also lowered.

                            These adjustments affect the comparability of
                        financial results from period to period as well as
                        comparisons with other energy companies, many of which
                        do not have such adjustments. Therefore, the Marathon
                        Group reports separately the effects of the IMV reserve
                        adjustments on financial results. In management's
                        opinion, the effects of such adjustments should be
                        considered separately when evaluating operating
                        performance.

                            In 1999, the IMV reserve adjustment resulted in a
                        credit to income from operations of $551 million
                        compared to a charge of $267 million in 1998, or a
                        change of $818 million. The favorable 1999 IMV reserve
                        adjustment, which is almost entirely recorded by MAP,
                        was primarily due to the significant increase in refined
                        product prices experienced during 1999. For additional
                        discussion of the IMV reserve, see Note 20 to the
                        Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                            NET INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS increased by
                        $51 million in 1999 from 1998, following a decrease of
                        $23 million in 1998 from 1997. The increase in 1999 was
                        primarily due to lower interest income and lower
                        capitalized interest on upstream projects. The decrease
                        in 1998 was primarily due to increased interest income
                        and higher capitalized interest on upstream projects,
                        partially offset by higher interest and other financial
                        costs resulting from the debt incurred for the Tarragon
                        acquisition. For additional details, see Note 8 to the
                        Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            The MINORITY INTEREST IN INCOME OF MAP, which
                        represents Ashland's 38 percent ownership interest,
                        increased by $198 million in 1999 from 1998, primarily
                        due to the favorable effects of the IMV reserve
                        adjustment as discussed above, partially offset by lower
                        RM&T segment income, also discussed above.

                            The PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES of $324
                        million in 1999 included a $23 million favorable
                        adjustment to deferred federal income taxes related to
                        the outcome of a United States Tax Court case. The 1998
                        income tax provision included $24 million of favorable
                        income tax accrual adjustments relating to foreign
                        operations. For additional discussion of income taxes,
                        see Note 18 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                            NET INCOME increased by $344 million in 1999 from
                        1998, following a decrease of $146 million in 1998 from
                        1997, primarily reflecting the factors discussed above.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND
LIQUIDITY

                            CURRENT ASSETS increased $1,126 million from
                        year-end 1998, primarily due to an increase in
                        receivables and inventories. The accounts receivable and
                        inventory increases were mainly due to higher year-end
                        commodity prices.

                            CURRENT LIABILITIES increased $539 million from
                        year-end 1998, primarily due to an increase in accounts
                        payable due to higher year-end commodity prices and the
                        recording of an inter-group income tax payable,
                        partially offset by a decrease in notes payable and
                        distribution payable to the minority shareholder of MAP.

                            NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT decreased $136
                        million from year-end 1998, primarily due to the sale of
                        certain domestic and international production
                        properties, the sale of Scurlock Permian LLC,
                        reclassifications to assets held for disposal, and the
                        sale of Carnegie Natural Gas Company and affiliated
                        subsidiaries. This was partially offset by 1999 capital
                        expenditures including the acquisition of certain
                        Ultramar Diamond Shamrock ("UDS") assets in Michigan.
                        Net property, plant and equipment for each of the last
                        three years is summarized in the following table:


                        (a) Amounts for 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of
                            MAP.
                        (b) Includes other energy related businesses and other
                            miscellaneous corporate net property, plant and
                            equipment.

                            TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December
                        31, 1999 were $3,368 million, a decrease of $279 million
                        from year-end 1998. This decrease is mainly due to a
                        decrease in the debt attributed to the Marathon Group
                        because of higher cash flow provided from operating
                        activities, and a decrease in notes payable. Virtually
                        all of the debt is a direct obligation of, or is
                        guaranteed by, USX.

                            NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES totaled
                        $2,016 million in 1999, compared with $1,642 million in
                        1998 and $1,246 million in 1997. Operating cash flow in
                        1997 included the impact of terminating Marathon's
                        participation in an accounts receivable sales program,
                        resulting in a cash outflow of $340 million. Excluding
                        the effect of this item, net cash from operating
                        activities increased by $374 million in 1999 from 1998
                        and increased by $56 million in 1998 from 1997. The
                        increase in 1999 mainly reflected favorable working
                        capital changes. The increase in 1998 mainly reflected
                        improved net income (excluding the IMV reserve
                        adjustment and other noncash items), partially offset by
                        unfavorable working capital changes.


                                                                           M-29


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            CAPITAL EXPENDITURES for each of the last three
                       years are summarized in the following table:


                        (a) Amount for 1998 excludes the Tarragon acquisition.
                        (b) Amounts for 1999 and 1998 include 100 percent of
                            MAP.
                        (c) Includes other energy related businesses and other
                            miscellaneous corporate capital expenditures.

                            During 1999, domestic E&P capital spending mainly
                        included the completion of Green Canyon Blocks 112 and
                        113 ("Angus") and additional development at South Pass
                        89 in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas developments in
                        East Texas and other gas basins throughout the western
                        United States. International E&P projects included the
                        completion of the Tchatamba South development, located
                        offshore Gabon, and oil and natural gas developments in
                        Canada. RM&T spending by MAP primarily consisted of the
                        acquisition of certain UDS assets in Michigan, upgrades
                        and expansions of retail marketing outlets, refinery
                        modifications and expansion and enhancement of logistic
                        systems.

                            Capital expenditures in 2000 are expected to be
                        approximately $1.4 billion, which is consistent with
                        1999 levels. Domestic E&P projects planned for 2000
                        include completion of the Petronius development in the
                        Gulf of Mexico, various producing property acquisitions
                        and continued natural gas developments in East Texas and
                        other gas basins throughout the western United States.
                        International E&P projects include the Tchatamba West
                        development, located offshore Gabon, and continued oil
                        and natural gas developments in Canada. RM&T spending by
                        MAP will primarily consist of upgrades and expansions of
                        retail marketing outlets, refinery improvements,
                        including the delayed coker unit project at the
                        Garyville refinery and expansion and enhancement of
                        logistic systems.

                            INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES were $59 million in 1999,
                        compared with $42 million in 1998. The 1999 amount
                        mainly reflected development spending for the Sakhalin
                        II project in Russia. The 1998 amount mainly reflected
                        MAP's acquisition of an interest in Southcap Pipe Line
                        Company for $22 million and continued investment in
                        pipeline and power projects.

                            LOANS AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES were $70 million in
                        1999, compared with $103 million in 1998. Cash outflows
                        in both periods primarily reflected funding provided to
                        equity affiliates for capital projects, primarily the
                        Sakhalin II project.

                            REPAYMENTS OF LOANS AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES were
                        $1 million in 1999, compared with $71 million in 1998.
                        The 1998 amount primarily was a result of repayments by
                        Sakhalin Energy of advances made by Marathon in
                        conjunction with the Sakhalin II project.

                            In 2000, net investments in affiliates are expected
                        to be approximately $52 million, primarily reflecting
                        continued development spending for the Sakhalin II
                        project.

                            Contract commitments for property, plant and
                        equipment acquisitions and long-term investments at
                        year-end 1999 were $485 million, compared with $624
                        million at year-end 1998.

                            The above statements with respect to future capital
                        expenditures and investments are forward-looking
                        statements, reflecting management's best estimates,
                        based on information currently available. To the extent
                        this information proves to be inaccurate, the timing and
                        levels of future spending could differ materially from
                        those included in the forward-looking statements.
                        Factors that could cause future capital expenditures and
                        investments to differ materially from present
                        expectations include price volatility, worldwide supply
                        and demand for petroleum products, general worldwide
                        economic conditions, levels of cash flow from
                        operations, available business opportunities, unforeseen
                        hazards such as weather conditions, and/or by delays in
                        obtaining government or partner approvals.

                            The ACQUISITION OF TARRAGON OIL AND GAS LIMITED in
                        1998 included cash payments of $686 million. For further
                        discussion of Tarragon, see Note 5 to the Marathon Group
                        Financial Statements.

                            CASH FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS was $356 million in
                        1999, compared with $65 million in 1998 and $60 million
                        in 1997. Proceeds in 1999 were mainly from the sales of
                        Scurlock Permian LLC, over 150 non-strategic domestic
                        and international production properties and Carnegie
                        Natural Gas Company and affiliated subsidiaries.
                        Proceeds in 1998 were mainly from the sales of domestic
                        production properties and equipment. Proceeds in 1997
                        were mainly from the sales of interests in various
                        domestic upstream properties, certain investments and an
                        interest in a domestic pipeline company.

                            The net change in RESTRICTED CASH was a net
                        withdrawal of $1 million in 1999 compared to a net
                        deposit of $21 million in 1998. The 1998 amount
                        represents cash deposited from the sales of domestic
                        production properties and equipment, partially offset by
                        cash withdrawn for the purchase of offshore production
                        leases.

                            FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, which consist of the Marathon
                        Group's portion of USX debt and preferred stock of a
                        subsidiary attributed to both groups, as well as debt
                        specifically attributed to the Marathon Group, decreased
                        by $299 million in 1999. Financial obligations decreased
                        primarily because cash from operating activities and
                        asset sales exceeded capital expenditures, distributions
                        to the minority shareholder of MAP and dividend
                        payments. For further details, see Management's
                        Discussion and Analysis of USX Consolidated Financial

                            DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDER OF MAP were
                        $400 million in 1999, compared with $211 million in
                        1998. The increase was primarily due to a distribution
                        of $103 million in the first quarter 1999, which related
                        to fourth quarter 1998 MAP activity.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

                            The Marathon Group has incurred and will continue to
                        incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance,
                        and remediation expenditures as a result of
                        environmental laws and regulations. To the extent these
                        expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
                        reflected in the prices of the Marathon Group's products
                        and services, operating results will be adversely
                        affected. The Marathon Group believes that substantially
                        all of its competitors are subject to similar
                        environmental laws and regulations. However, the
                        specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on
                        a number of factors, including the age and location of
                        its operating facilities, marketing areas, production
                        processes and whether or not it is engaged in the
                        petrochemical business, power business or the marine
                        transportation of crude oil and refined products.

                            Marathon Group environmental expenditures for each
                        of the last three years were(a):


                        (a) Amounts are determined based on American Petroleum
                            Institute survey guidelines.
                        (b) Amounts for 1999 and 1998 include 100% of MAP.
                        (c) Reclassified to conform to 1999 classifications.
                        (d) These amounts include spending charged against such
                            reserves, net of recoveries, where permissible, but
                            do not include noncash provisions recorded for
                            environmental remediation.


                                                                           M-31


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            The Marathon Group's environmental capital
                        expenditures accounted for three percent of total
                        capital expenditures in 1999, seven percent in 1998
                        (excluding the acquisition of Tarragon) and six percent
                        in 1997.

                            During 1997 through 1999, compliance expenditures
                        represented one percent of the Marathon Group's total
                        operating costs. Remediation spending during this period
                        was primarily related to retail marketing outlets which
                        incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil and groundwater
                        contamination associated with underground storage tanks
                        and piping.

                            USX has been notified that it is a potentially
                        responsible party ("PRP") at 15 waste sites related to
                        the Marathon Group under the Comprehensive Environmental
                        Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as
                        of December 31, 1999. In addition, there are 8 sites
                        related to the Marathon Group where USX has received
                        information requests or other indications that USX may
                        be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information
                        is not presently available to confirm the existence of
                        liability.

                            There are also 110 additional sites, excluding
                        retail marketing outlets, related to the Marathon Group
                        where remediation is being sought under other
                        environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where
                        private parties are seeking remediation through
                        discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 17 were
                        associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland
                        for which Ashland has retained liability for all costs
                        associated with remediation.

                            At many of these sites, USX is one of a number of
                        parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as
                        well as USX's share thereof, is frequently dependent
                        upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies.
                        The Marathon Group accrues for environmental remediation
                        activities when the responsibility to remediate is
                        probable and the amount of associated costs is
                        reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation
                        matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as
                        additional remediation obligations arise, charges in
                        excess of those previously accrued may be required. See
                        Note 26 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

                            New or expanded environmental requirements, which
                        could increase the Marathon Group's environmental costs,
                        may arise in the future. USX intends to comply with all
                        legal requirements regarding the environment, but since
                        many of them are not fixed or presently determinable
                        (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by
                        future legislation, it is not possible to predict
                        accurately the ultimate cost of compliance, including
                        remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties
                        which may be imposed. However, based on presently
                        available information, and existing laws and regulations
                        as currently implemented, the Marathon Group does not
                        anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures
                        (including operating and maintenance and remediation)
                        will materially increase in 2000. The Marathon Group's
                        environmental capital expenditures are expected to be
                        approximately $80 million in 2000. Predictions beyond
                        2000 can only be broad-based estimates which have
                        varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
                        evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the
                        possible imposition of more stringent requirements and
                        the availability of new technologies, among other
                        matters. Based upon currently identified projects, the
                        Marathon Group anticipates that environmental capital
                        expenditures will be approximately $55 million in 2001;
                        however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and
                        scope of environmental projects are revised as a result
                        of improved technology or changes in regulatory
                        requirements and could increase if additional projects
                        are identified or additional requirements are imposed.

                            In October 1998, the National Enforcement
                        Investigations Center and Region V of the United States
                        Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") conducted a
                        multi-media inspection of MAP's Detroit refinery.
                        Subsequently, in November 1998, Region V conducted a
                        multi-media inspection of MAP's Robinson refinery. These
                        inspections covered compliance with the Clean Air Act
                        (New Source Performance Standards, Prevention of
                        Significant Deterioration, and the National Emission
                        Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Benzene), the
                        Clean Water Act (Permit exceedances for the Waste Water
                        Treatment Plant), reporting obligations under the
                        Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and
                        the handling of process waste. Although MAP has been
                        advised as to certain compliance issues regarding MAP's
                        Detroit refinery, it is not known when complete findings
                        on the

M-32


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                        results of the inspections will be issued. Thus far, MAP
                        has been served with two Notices of Violation and three
                        Findings of Violation in connection with the multi-media
                        inspections at its Detroit refinery. The Detroit notices
                        allege violations of the Michigan State Air Pollution
                        Regulations, the EPA New Source Performance Standards
                        and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
                        Pollutants for benzene. The Robinson notice alleges
                        noncompliance with a general conduct provision as a
                        result of acid-gas flaring since 1994. The Robinson
                        refinery is alleged to have routine acid gas flaring
                        arising from a failure to properly operate and maintain
                        the sulfur recovery plant and amine units. MAP can
                        contest the factual and legal basis for the allegations
                        prior to the EPA taking enforcement action. At this
                        time, it is not known when complete findings on the
                        results of these multi-media inspections will be issued.

                            During 1999 an EPA advisory panel on oxygenate use
                        in gasoline issued recommendations to the EPA, calling
                        for the improved protection of drinking water from
                        methyl tertiary butyl ether ("MTBE") impacts, a
                        substantial reduction in the use of MTBE, and action by
                        Congress to remove the oxygenate requirements for
                        reformulated gasoline under the Clean Air Act. The panel
                        reviewed public health and environmental issues that
                        have been raised by the use of MTBE in gasoline, and
                        specifically by the discovery of MTBE in water supplies.
                        State and federal environmental regulatory agencies
                        could implement the majority of the recommendations,
                        while some would require Congressional legislative
                        action. California has acted to ban MTBE use by December
                        31, 2002 and has requested a waiver from the EPA of
                        California state oxygenate requirements. Other states
                        are also assessing whether to continue the use of MTBE
                        in gasoline.

                            Marathon has a non-material investment in MTBE units
                        at its Robinson, Catlettsburg and Detroit refineries.
                        Approximately eight percent of Marathon's refinery
                        gasoline production includes MTBE. Potential phase-outs
                        or restrictions on the use of MTBE would not be expected
                        to have a material impact on Marathon and its
                        operations, although it is not possible to reach any
                        conclusions until federal or further state actions, if
                        any, are taken.

                            USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of
                        pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                        commitments relating to the Marathon Group involving a
                        variety of matters, including laws and regulations
                        relating to the environment, certain of which are
                        discussed in Note 26 to the Marathon Group Financial
                        Statements. The ultimate resolution of these
                        contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                        be material to the Marathon Group financial statements.
                        However, management believes that USX will remain a
                        viable and competitive enterprise even though it is
                        possible that these contingencies could be resolved
                        unfavorably to the Marathon Group. See Management's
                        Discussion and Analysis of USX Consolidated Financial
                        Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity.

                        OUTLOOK

                            The outlook regarding the Marathon Group's upstream
                        revenues and income is largely dependent upon future
                        prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural
                        gas. Prices have historically been volatile and have
                        frequently been affected by unpredictable changes in
                        supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in
                        worldwide economic activity and political developments
                        in the world's major oil and gas producing and consuming
                        areas. Any significant decline in prices could have a
                        material adverse effect on the Marathon Group's results
                        of operations. A prolonged decline in such prices could
                        also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and
                        natural gas reserves that can be economically produced
                        and the amount of capital available for exploration and
                        development.

                            In 2000, worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production,
                        including Marathon's share of equity affiliates, is
                        expected to increase from 1999, to average approximately
                        210,000 bpd. Most of the increase is anticipated in the
                        second half of the year. This primarily reflects
                        projected new production from the start-up of Petronius
                        in the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter of 2000 and
                        one full ice-free season of production from the
                        Piltun-Astokhskoye ("P-A") field in Russia, partially
                        offset by natural production declines of mature fields.
                        In 2001, worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production is
                        expected to increase further to approximately 230,000
                        bpd. In 2000 and 2001, worldwide natural gas volumes,
                        including Marathon's share of equity affiliates, are
                        expected to average approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet
                        per day ("bcfd") and 1.4 bcfd, respectively. These
                        projections are based on known discoveries and do not
                        assume any new discoveries, acquisitions or
                        dispositions.

                                                                           M-33


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            Progress continues on the Petronius development in
                        the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 1999, efforts focused
                        on rebuilding the lost platform deck module, which was
                        dropped during installation in 1998. Third party
                        insurance has covered substantially all rebuilding costs
                        associated with this incident. The platform module is
                        scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2000
                        and offshore installation should occur in the second
                        quarter of 2000 with first production expected in the
                        third quarter of 2000.

                            In September 1999, production commenced from the
                        Angus field, a three-well subsea development in the Gulf
                        of Mexico. In January 2000, Marathon sold its 33.34
                        percent interest in the Angus development and will
                        report a pre-tax gain of approximately $85 million in
                        the first quarter of 2000. Marathon's worldwide liquid
                        hydrocarbon production forecasts discussed previously
                        exclude estimated 2000 and 2001 production from the
                        Angus field.

                            On January 21, 2000, the Poseidon pipeline, a subsea
                        pipeline that transports Marathon's production from
                        Ewing Bank 873, was damaged by a ship's anchor and had
                        to be shut-in. The pipeline was inoperable for
                        approximately three weeks for repairs and resulted in no
                        production from Ewing Bank during this period. Marathon
                        does not expect this incident to have a material impact
                        on the current year's operations.

                            Marathon has increased its presence in the Gulf of
                        Mexico through extensive acquisition and analysis of 3-D
                        seismic. Plans are to drill eight deepwater exploratory
                        wells in 2000. To support this increased drilling
                        activity, Marathon has contracted two new deepwater
                        rigs, capable of drilling in water depths beyond 6,500
                        feet.

                            Marathon holds a 37.5 percent interest in Sakhalin
                        Energy Investment Company Ltd. ("Sakhalin Energy"), an
                        incorporated joint venture company responsible for the
                        overall management of the Sakhalin II project. This
                        project includes development of the P-A oil field and
                        the Lunskoye gas-condensate field, which are located
                        8-12 miles offshore Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far
                        East Region. The Russian State Reserves Committee has
                        approved estimated combined reserves for the P-A and
                        Lunskoye fields of 1 billion gross barrels of liquid
                        hydrocarbons and 14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

                            In July 1999, oil production commenced from the P-A
                        field and the first lifting occurred on September 20,
                        1999. In late September, production was shut-in
                        following a failure of the mooring system and resumed
                        only for brief periods during October and November
                        before operations ceased for the winter in early
                        December. A re-designed mooring system is expected to be
                        installed in the second quarter of 2000 and production
                        is expected to resume in June 2000, the beginning of the
                        ice-free season. In 2000, gross production is expected
                        to average 36,000 gross bpd (on an annualized basis).
                        Marathon's equity share of reserves from primary
                        production in the Astokh Feature is 80 million barrels
                        of oil.

                            Further development of the P-A field continues,
                        including plans to drill two appraisal and eight
                        development wells in 2000 and to commence waterflood
                        activity for the Astokh Feature. With respect to the
                        Lunskoye field, appraisal work and efforts to secure
                        long term gas sales markets continue. Commencement of
                        gas production from the Lunskoye field, which will be
                        contingent upon the conclusion of a gas sales contract,
                        is anticipated to occur in 2006 or later.

                            At December 31, 1999, Marathon's net investment in
                        the Sakhalin II project was approximately $400 million.

                            Other major upstream projects, which are currently
                        underway or under evaluation and are expected to improve
                        future income streams, include the Mississippi Canyon
                        Block 348 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Tchatamba West
                        field, located offshore Gabon, and various North
                        American natural gas fields.

                            In 2000, Marathon launched an initiative that
                        targets $150 million in annual, repeatable pre-tax
                        operating efficiencies by year-end 2001. This initiative
                        focuses on gaining measurable, hard-dollar improvements
                        in revenues or expenses. Besides a goal to constrain
                        production costs, this initiative includes strategic
                        management of Marathon's portfolio of properties,
                        allocation of personnel and resources to assets and
                        activities with the greatest opportunity for return and
                        growth, and the adoption of enterprise-wide tools
                        (computerization and other new technology) to elevate
                        workforce productivity.

                                                                           M-34


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            The above discussion includes forward-looking
                        statements with respect to worldwide liquid hydrocarbon
                        production (including Russia for 2000) and natural gas
                        volumes for 2000 and 2001, commencement of projects and
                        dates of initial production, Gulf of Mexico and Russia
                        drilling programs, and the amount and timing of
                        operating efficiencies. These statements are based on a
                        number of assumptions, including (among others) prices,
                        amount of capital available for exploration and
                        development, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum
                        products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates,
                        production decline rates of mature fields, timing of
                        commencing production from new wells, timing and results
                        of future development drilling, drilling rig
                        availability, reserve replacement rates, other
                        geological, operating and economic considerations, and
                        the ability to identify sufficient initiatives in order
                        to generate efficiencies. In addition, development of
                        new production properties in countries outside the
                        United States may require protracted negotiations with
                        host governments and is frequently subject to political
                        considerations, such as tax regulations, which could
                        adversely affect the timing and economics of projects.
                        To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or
                        negotiations and other considerations are not
                        satisfactorily resolved, actual results could be
                        materially different than present expectations.

                            Downstream income of the Marathon Group is largely
                        dependent upon refined product margins, which reflect
                        the difference between the selling prices of refined
                        products and the cost of raw materials refined and
                        manufacturing costs. Refined product margins have been
                        historically volatile and vary with the level of
                        economic activity in the various marketing areas, the
                        regulatory climate, crude oil costs, manufacturing costs
                        and the available supply of crude oil and refined
                        products.

                            MAP's subsidiary, Ohio River Pipe Line LLC ("ORPL"),
                        plans to build a pipeline from Kenova, West Virginia to
                        Columbus, Ohio. ORPL is a common carrier pipeline
                        company and the pipeline will be an interstate common
                        carrier pipeline. The pipeline is expected to initially
                        move about 50,000 bpd of refined petroleum into the
                        central Ohio region. Construction is currently expected
                        to begin in late 2000. However, the construction
                        schedule is largely dependent on obtaining the necessary
                        rights-of-way, of which over 86 percent have been
                        obtained to date, and final regulatory approvals.

                            MAP is constructing a delayed coker unit at its
                        Garyville, LA refinery. This unit will allow for the use
                        of heavier, lower cost crude and eliminate the
                        production of heavy fuel oil. To supply this new unit,
                        MAP reached an agreement with P.M.I. Comercio
                        Internacional, S.A. de C.V., (PMI), an affiliate of
                        Petroleos Mexicanos, (PEMEX), to purchase approximately
                        90,000 bpd of heavy Maya crude oil. This is a multi-year
                        contract, which will begin upon completion of the
                        delayed coker unit which is scheduled in the fourth
                        quarter of 2001. In addition, a project to increase
                        crude throughput and light product output is being
                        undertaken at MAP's Robinson, IL refinery and is also
                        expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001.

                            The above statements with respect to pipeline and
                        refinery improvement projects are forward looking
                        statements. Some factors that could potentially cause
                        actual results to differ materially from present
                        expectations include (among others) the price of
                        petroleum products, levels of cash flow from operations,
                        obtaining the necessary construction and environmental
                        permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions,
                        obtaining the necessary rights-of-way and regulatory
                        approval constraints.

                        YEAR 2000

                            The Marathon Group encountered only minor problems
                        during the rollover to the Year 2000, none of which
                        impacted operations. Most problems were quickly
                        corrected, while the remaining problems were addressed
                        by utilizing contingency plans to prevent any business
                        disruptions.

                            Essentially all business processes and systems have
                        been successfully operated since the rollover to the
                        Year 2000. However, the possibility for Year 2000
                        problems still exists. Therefore, the Marathon Group
                        plans to continue monitoring its business processes and
                        systems to ensure dates and date-related information
                        continue to be processed correctly.

                            Total costs associated with Year 2000 readiness
                        were $36 million, including $18 million of incremental
                        costs.

                                                                           M-35


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                        ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                            In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
                        Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                        No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
                        Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"). This new standard
                        requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets
                        or liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 133 may result in
                        additional volatility in both current period earnings
                        and other comprehensive income as a result of recording
                        recognized and unrecognized gains and losses resulting
                        from changes in the fair value of derivative
                        instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from
                        adoption of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a
                        cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

                            Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to
                        designate certain derivative instruments as hedges even
                        if the strategy qualifies for hedge accounting
                        treatment. This approach would eliminate the
                        administrative effort needed to measure effectiveness
                        and monitor such instruments; however, this approach
                        also may result in additional volatility in current
                        period earnings.

                            USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of
                        adoption on either the financial position or results of
                        operations. It is not possible to estimate what effect
                        this Statement will have on future results of
                        operations, although greater period-to-period volatility
                        is likely. USX plans to adopt the Standard effective
                        January 1, 2001.

              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK



              MANAGEMENT OPINION CONCERNING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

                  USX uses commodity-based and foreign currency derivative
              instruments to manage its price risk. Management has authorized
              the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage
              exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase,
              production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined products,
              nonferrous metals and electricity. For transactions that
              qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses are
              deferred and subsequently recognized in income from operations,
              in the same period as the underlying physical transaction.
              Derivative instruments used for trading and other activities
              are marked-to-market and the resulting gains or losses are
              recognized in the current period in income from operations.
              While USX's risk management activities generally reduce market
              risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for
              raw material purchases and products sold, such activities can
              also encompass strategies that assume price risk.

                  Management believes that use of derivative instruments
              along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls
              does not expose the Marathon Group to material risk. The use of
              derivative instruments could materially affect the Marathon
              Group's results of operations in particular quarterly or annual
              periods. However, management believes that use of these
              instruments will not have a material adverse effect on
              financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting
              policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 2 to the
              Marathon Group Financial Statements.

              COMMODITY PRICE RISK AND RELATED RISKS

                  In the normal course of its business, the Marathon Group is
              exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the
              purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas and
              refined products. To a lesser extent, the Marathon Group is
              exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas
              liquids, electricity and petroleum feedstocks used as raw
              materials. The Marathon Group is also exposed to effects of
              price fluctuations on the value of its commodity inventories.

                  The Marathon Group's market risk strategy has generally
              been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services
              and allow operating results to reflect market price movements
              dictated by supply and demand. However, the Marathon Group uses
              fixed-price contracts and derivative commodity instruments to
              manage a relatively small portion of its commodity price risk.
              The Marathon Group uses fixed-price contracts for portions of
              its natural gas production to manage exposure to fluctuations
              in natural gas prices. In addition, the Marathon Group uses
              derivative commodity instruments such as exchange-traded
              futures contracts and options, and over-the-counter ("OTC")
              commodity swaps and options to manage exposure to market risk
              related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil,
              natural gas, refined products and electricity. For transactions
              that qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or
              losses are deferred and subsequently recognized in income from
              operations, in the same period as the underlying physical
              transaction. Derivative instruments used for trading and other
              activities are marked-to-market and the resulting gains or
              losses are recognized in the current period in income from
              operations. However, certain derivative commodity instruments
              have the effect of restoring the equity portion of fixed-price
              sales of natural gas to variable market-based pricing. These
              instruments are used as part of the Marathon Group's overall
              risk management programs.

                                                                          M-37


              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

                  Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pretax
              income of hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in commodity prices
              for open derivative commodity instruments for the Marathon
              Group as of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, are
              provided in the following table(a):



             (a) Gains and losses on derivative commodity instruments are
                 generally offset by price changes in the underlying
                 commodity. Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the
                 sensitivity analyses. Amounts reflect the estimated
                 incremental effect on pretax income of hypothetical 10% and
                 25% changes in closing commodity prices for each open
                 contract position at December 31, 1999 and December 31,
                 1998. Marathon Group management evaluates their portfolio of
                 derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and
                 adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market
                 conditions and changes in risk profiles. Changes to the
                 portfolio subsequent to December 31, 1999, would cause
                 future pretax income effects to differ from those presented
                 in the table.

             (b) The number of net open contracts varied throughout 1999,
                 from a low of 107 contracts at July 14, to a high of 34,199
                 contracts at April 16, and averaged 14,462 for the year. The
                 derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions
                 taken also varied throughout 1999, and will continue to vary
                 in the future. Because of these variations in the
                 composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open
                 contracts, by itself, cannot be used to predict future
                 income effects.

             (c) The calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps
                 assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly
                 correlated. Gains and losses on options are based on changes
                 in intrinsic value only.

             (d) The direction of the price change used in calculating the
                 sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which
                 would result in the largest incremental decrease in pretax
                 income when applied to the derivative commodity instruments
                 used to hedge that commodity.

                  While derivative commodity instruments are generally used
              to reduce risks from unfavorable commodity price movements,
              they also may limit the opportunity to benefit from favorable
              movements. In total, Marathon's exploration and production
              operations recorded net pretax other than trading activity
              gains of $3 million in 1999, losses of $3 million in 1998 and
              losses of $3 million in 1997.

                  Marathon's refining, marketing and transportation
              operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to
              lock-in costs of certain raw material purchases, to protect
              carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on
              fixed-price sales of refined products. Marathon's refining,
              marketing and transportation recorded net pretax other than
              trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority interest in
              MAP, of approximately $8 million in 1999, $28 million in 1998,
              and $29 million in 1997. Beginning in 1999, Marathon's
              refining, marketing and transportation operations used
              derivative instruments for trading activities and recorded net
              pretax trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority interest
              in MAP, of $5 million. For additional quantitative information
              relating to derivative commodity instruments, including
              aggregate contract values and fair values, where appropriate,

              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

                  The Marathon Group is subject to basis risk, caused by
              factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures
              prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the
              cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas
              transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference
              prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets.
              For example, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") contracts
              for natural gas are priced at Louisiana's Henry Hub, while the
              underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold
              in the Western United States at prices that do not move in
              strict correlation with NYMEX prices. To the extent that
              commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in
              other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer
              provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to
              basis risk. These regional price differences could yield
              favorable or unfavorable results. OTC transactions are being
              used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk.

                  The Marathon Group is subject to liquidity risk, caused by
              timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a
              potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to
              accept an offsetting position. Due to the large number of
              active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low
              for exchange-traded transactions.

              INTEREST RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations
              on certain of its non-derivative financial instruments. A
              sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a
              hypothetical 10% decrease in year-end 1999 and 1998 interest
              rates on the fair value of the Marathon Group's specifically
              attributed non-derivative financial instruments and the
              Marathon Group's portion of USX's non-derivative financial
              instruments attributed to both groups, is provided in the
              following table:



             (a) Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes
                 payable, accounts payable and accrued interest, approximate
                 carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in
                 interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the
                 instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded
                 from the table.

             (b) See Note 25 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

             (c) Reflects, by class of financial instrument, the estimated
                 incremental effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in
                 interest rates at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998 on
                 the fair value of non-derivative financial instruments. For
                 financial liabilities, this assumes a 10% decrease in the
                 weighted average yield to maturity of USX's long-term debt
                 at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.

             (d) For additional information, see Note 19 to the Marathon
                 Group Financial Statements.

             (e) Includes amounts due within one year.

             (f) Fair value was based on market prices where available, or
                 current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms
                 and maturities. For additional information, see Note 12 to
                 the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

             (g) See Note 23 to the USX Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  At December 31, 1999, USX's portfolio of long-term debt was
              comprised primarily of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the
              fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects
              of interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is illustrated
              by the $144 million increase in the fair value of long-term
              debt assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates.
              However, USX's sensitivity to interest rate declines and
              corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio
              would unfavorably affect USX's results and cash flows only to
              the extent that USX elected to repurchase or otherwise retire
              all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices
              above carrying value.

                                                                          M-39


              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

              FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to
              anticipated revenues and operating costs, firm commitments for
              capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities
              denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. USX has not
              generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk.
              However, USX has made limited use of forward currency contracts
              to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations. At
              December 31, 1999, USX had open Canadian dollar forward
              purchase contracts with a total carrying value of approximately
              $52 million compared to $36 million at December 31, 1998. A 10%
              increase in the December 31, 1999, Canadian dollar to U.S.
              dollar forward rate would result in a charge to income of
              approximately $5 million. Last year, a 10% increase in the
              December 31, 1998 Canadian dollar to U. S. dollar forward rate
              would have resulted in a charge to income of $3 million. The
              entire amount of these contracts is attributed to the Marathon
              Group.

              EQUITY PRICE RISK

                  At December 31, 1999, the Marathon Group had no material
              exposure to equity price risk.

              SAFE HARBOR

                  The Marathon Group's quantitative and qualitative
              disclosures about market risk include forward-looking
              statements with respect to management's opinion about risks
              associated with the Marathon Group's use of derivative
              instruments. These statements are based on certain assumptions
              with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand
              for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. To the extent
              that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes
              with respect to the Marathon Group's hedging programs may
              differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking
              statements.

              recognized in the current period in income from operations.
              While USX's risk management activities generally reduce market
              risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for
              raw material purchases and products sold, such activities can

              operations. However, certain derivative commodity instruments
              have the effect of restoring the equity portion of fixed-price
              sales of natural gas to variable market-based pricing. These
              instruments are used as part of the Marathon Group's overall
              risk management programs.

                                                                          M-37


              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

                  Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pretax
              income of hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in commodity prices
              for open derivative commodity instruments for the Marathon
              Group as of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, are
              provided in the following table(a):



             (a) Gains and losses on derivative commodity instruments are
                 generally offset by price changes in the underlying
                 commodity. Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the
                 sensitivity analyses. Amounts reflect the estimated
                 incremental effect on pretax income of hypothetical 10% and
                 25% changes in closing commodity prices for each open
                 contract position at December 31, 1999 and December 31,
                 1998. Marathon Group management evaluates their portfolio of
                 derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and
                 adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market
                 conditions and changes in risk profiles. Changes to the
                 portfolio subsequent to December 31, 1999, would cause
                 future pretax income effects to differ from those presented
                 in the table.

             (b) The number of net open contracts varied throughout 1999,
                 from a low of 107 contracts at July 14, to a high of 34,199
                 contracts at April 16, and averaged 14,462 for the year. The
                 derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions
                 taken also varied throughout 1999, and will continue to vary
                 in the future. Because of these variations in the
                 composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open
                 contracts, by itself, cannot be used to predict future
                 income effects.

             (c) The calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps
                 assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly
                 correlated. Gains and losses on options are based on changes
                 in intrinsic value only.

             (d) The direction of the price change used in calculating the
                 sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which
                 would result in the largest incremental decrease in pretax
                 income when applied to the derivative commodity instruments
                 used to hedge that commodity.

                  While derivative commodity instruments are generally used
              to reduce risks from unfavorable commodity price movements,
              they also may limit the opportunity to benefit from favorable
              movements. In total, Marathon's exploration and production
              operations recorded net pretax other than trading activity
              gains of $3 million in 1999, losses of $3 million in 1998 and
              losses of $3 million in 1997.

                  Marathon's refining, marketing and transportation
              operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to
              lock-in costs of certain raw material purchases, to protect
              carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on
              fixed-price sales of refined products. Marathon's refining,
              marketing and transportation recorded net pretax other than
              trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority interest in
              MAP, of approximately $8 million in 1999, $28 million in 1998,
              and $29 million in 1997. Beginning in 1999, Marathon's
              refining, marketing and transportation operations used
              derivative instruments for trading activities and recorded net
              pretax trading activity gains, net of the 38% minority interest
              in MAP, of $5 million. For additional quantitative information
              relating to derivative commodity instruments, including
              aggregate contract values and fair values, where appropriate,
              see Note 24 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

                  The Marathon Group is subject to basis risk, caused by
              factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures
              prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the
              cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas
              transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference
              prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets.
              For example, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") contracts
              for natural gas are priced at Louisiana's Henry Hub, while the
              underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold
              in the Western United States at prices that do not move in
              strict correlation with NYMEX prices. To the extent that
              commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in
              other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer
              provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to
              basis risk. These regional price differences could yield
              favorable or unfavorable results. OTC transactions are being
              used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk.

                  The Marathon Group is subject to liquidity risk, caused by
              timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a
              potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to
              accept an offsetting position. Due to the large number of
              active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low
              for exchange-traded transactions.

              INTEREST RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations
              on certain of its non-derivative financial instruments. A
              sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a
              hypothetical 10% decrease in year-end 1999 and 1998 interest
              rates on the fair value of the Marathon Group's specifically
              attributed non-derivative financial instruments and the
              Marathon Group's portion of USX's non-derivative financial
              instruments attributed to both groups, is provided in the
              following table:



             (a) Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes
                 payable, accounts payable and accrued interest, approximate
                 carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in
                 interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the
                 instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded
                 from the table.

             (b) See Note 25 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

             (c) Reflects, by class of financial instrument, the estimated
                 incremental effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in
                 interest rates at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998 on
                 the fair value of non-derivative financial instruments. For
                 financial liabilities, this assumes a 10% decrease in the
                 weighted average yield to maturity of USX's long-term debt
                 at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.

             (d) For additional information, see Note 19 to the Marathon
                 Group Financial Statements.

             (e) Includes amounts due within one year.

             (f) Fair value was based on market prices where available, or
                 current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms
                 and maturities. For additional information, see Note 12 to
                 the Marathon Group Financial Statements.

             (g) See Note 23 to the USX Consolidated Financial Statements.

                  At December 31, 1999, USX's portfolio of long-term debt was
              comprised primarily of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the
              fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects
              of interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is illustrated
              by the $144 million increase in the fair value of long-term
              debt assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates.
              However, USX's sensitivity to interest rate declines and
              corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio
              would unfavorably affect USX's results and cash flows only to
              the extent that USX elected to repurchase or otherwise retire
              all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices
              above carrying value.

                                                                          M-39


              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
              (CONTINUED)

              FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

                  USX is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to
              anticipated revenues and operating costs, firm commitments for
              capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities
              denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. USX has not
              generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk.
              However, USX has made limited use of forward currency contracts
              to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations. At
              December 31, 1999, USX had open Canadian dollar forward
              purchase contracts with a total carrying value of approximately
              $52 million compared to $36 million at December 31, 1998. A 10%
              increase in the December 31, 1999, Canadian dollar to U.S.
              dollar forward rate would result in a charge to income of
              approximately $5 million. Last year, a 10% increase in the
              December 31, 1998 Canadian dollar to U. S. dollar forward rate
              would have resulted in a charge to income of $3 million. The
              entire amount of these contracts is attributed to the Marathon
              Group.

              EQUITY PRICE RISK

                  At December 31, 1999, the Marathon Group had no material
              exposure to equity price risk.

              SAFE HARBOR

                  The Marathon Group's quantitative and qualitative
              disclosures about market risk include forward-looking
              statements with respect to management's opinion about risks
              associated with the Marathon Group's use of derivative
              instruments. These statements are based on certain assumptions
              with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand
              for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. To the extent
              that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes
              with respect to the Marathon Group's hedging programs may
              differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking
              statements.

              INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,
              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, AND QUANTITATIVE AND
              QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

The accompanying financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group are the
responsibility of and have been prepared by USX Corporation (USX) in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best
judgments and estimates. The U. S. Steel Group financial information
displayed in other sections of this report is consistent with these financial
statements.
     USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial
records by careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements
that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by communications
programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
     USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting
controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
and that financial records are reliable. Appropriate management monitors the
system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In addition, as
part of their audit of the financial statements, USX's independent
accountants, who are elected by the stockholders, review and test the
internal accounting controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance
thereon in determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be
applied.
     The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of
financial reporting and internal accounting control through its Audit
Committee. This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement directors,
regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants,
management and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of
its responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls and the
consolidated and group financial statements.





REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements appearing on pages S-2
through S-20 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the U. S. Steel Group at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.
     The U. S. Steel Group is a business unit of USX Corporation (as
described in Note 1, page S-5); accordingly, the financial statements of the
U. S. Steel Group should be read in connection with the consolidated
financial statements of USX Corporation.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

                        After the redemption of the USX - Delhi Group stock on
                        January 26, 1998, USX Corporation (USX) has two classes
                        of common stock: USX - U. S. Steel Group Common Stock
                        (Steel Stock) and USX - Marathon Group Common Stock
                        (Marathon Stock), which are intended to reflect the
                        performance of the U. S. Steel Group and the Marathon
                        Group, respectively.
                             The financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group
                        include the financial position, results of operations
                        and cash flows for all businesses of USX other than the
                        businesses, assets and liabilities included in the
                        Marathon Group, and a portion of the corporate assets
                        and liabilities and related transactions which are not
                        separately identified with ongoing operating units of
                        USX. The U. S. Steel Group financial statements are
                        prepared using the amounts included in the USX
                        consolidated financial statements. For a description of
                        the U. S. Steel Group's operating segment, see Note 7.
                             Although the financial statements of the U. S.
                        Steel Group and the Marathon Group separately report the
                        assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities)
                        and stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such
                        Group, such attribution of assets, liabilities
                        (including contingent liabilities) and stockholders'
                        equity between the U. S. Steel Group and the Marathon
                        Group for the purpose of preparing their respective
                        financial statements does not affect legal title to such
                        assets or responsibility for such liabilities. Holders
                        of Steel Stock and Marathon Stock are holders of common
                        stock of USX, and continue to be subject to all the
                        risks associated with an investment in USX and all of
                        its businesses and liabilities. Financial impacts
                        arising from one Group that affect the overall cost of
                        USX's capital could affect the results of operations and
                        financial condition of the other Group. In addition, net
                        losses of either Group, as well as dividends and
                        distributions on any class of USX Common Stock or series
                        of preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX
                        Common Stock or series of preferred stock at prices in
                        excess of par or stated value, will reduce the funds of
                        USX legally available for payment of dividends on both
                        classes of Common Stock. Accordingly, the USX
                        consolidated financial information should be read in
                        connection with the U. S. Steel Group financial
                        information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                        PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION - These financial
                        statements include the accounts of the U. S. Steel
                        Group. The U. S. Steel Group and the Marathon Group
                        financial statements, taken together, comprise all of
                        the accounts included in the USX consolidated financial
                        statements.
                             Investments in entities over which the U. S. Steel
                        Group has significant influence are accounted for using
                        the equity method of accounting and are carried at the
                        U. S. Steel Group's share of net assets plus loans and
                        advances.
                             Investments in companies whose stock is publicly
                        traded are carried at market value. The difference
                        between the cost of these investments and market value
                        is recorded in other comprehensive income (net of tax).
                        Investments in companies whose stock has no readily
                        determinable fair value are carried at cost.

                        USE OF ESTIMATES - Generally accepted accounting
                        principles require management to make estimates and
                        assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
                        and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
                        liabilities at year-end and the reported amounts of
                        revenues and expenses during the year. Significant items
                        subject to such estimates and assumptions include the
                        carrying value of long-lived assets; valuation
                        allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred
                        income tax assets; environmental liabilities;
                        liabilities for potential tax deficiencies and potential
                        litigation claims and settlements; and assets and
                        obligations related to employee benefits. Additionally,
                        certain estimated liabilities are recorded when
                        management commits to a plan to close an operating
                        facility or to exit a business activity. Actual results
                        could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

                        REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenues principally include
                        sales, dividend and affiliate income, gains or losses on
                        the disposal of assets and gains or losses from changes
                        in ownership interests.
                             Sales are recognized when products are shipped or
                        services are provided to customers. Income from
                        affiliates includes the U. S. Steel Group's
                        proportionate share of income from equity method
                        investments.
                             When long-lived assets depreciated on an individual
                        basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or
                        losses are reflected in income. Gains on disposal of
                        long-lived assets are recognized when earned, which is
                        generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal
                        is expected, such losses are recognized when long-lived
                        assets are reclassified as assets held for sale.
                        Proceeds from disposal of long-lived assets depreciated
                        on a group basis are credited to accumulated
                        depreciation, depletion and amortization with no
                        immediate effect on income.
                             Gains or losses from a change in ownership of an
                        unconsolidated affiliate are recognized in revenues in
                        the period of change.

                                                                            S-5



                        CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents
                        include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid
                        debt instruments with maturities generally of three
                        months or less.

                        INVENTORIES - Inventories are carried at lower of cost
                        or market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily
                        under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

                        DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - The U. S. Steel Group uses
                        commodity-based derivative instruments to manage its
                        exposure to price risk. Management is authorized to use
                        futures, forwards, swaps and options related to the
                        purchase of natural gas, refined products and nonferrous
                        metals used in steel operations. For transactions that
                        qualify for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or
                        losses are deferred and subsequently recognized in
                        income from operations, as a component of sales or cost
                        of sales, in the same period as the underlying physical
                        transaction. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative
                        positions cannot remain open if the underlying physical
                        market risk has been removed. Recorded deferred gains or
                        losses are reflected within other current and noncurrent
                        assets or accounts payable and deferred credits and
                        other liabilities, as appropriate.

                        LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Depreciation is generally computed
                        using a modified straight-line method based upon
                        estimated lives of assets and production levels. The
                        modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a
                        production level below 81% of capability, to a maximum
                        of 105% for a 100% production level. No modification is
                        made at the 95% production level, considered the normal
                        long-range level.
                             Depletion of mineral properties is based on rates
                        which are expected to amortize cost over the estimated
                        tonnage of minerals to be removed.
                             The U. S. Steel Group evaluates impairment of its
                        long-lived assets on an individual asset basis or by
                        logical groupings of assets. Assets deemed to be
                        impaired are written down to their fair value, including
                        any related goodwill, using discounted future cash flows
                        and, if available, comparable market values.

                        ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - The U. S. Steel Group
                        provides for remediation costs and penalties when the
                        responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount
                        of associated costs is reasonably determinable.
                        Generally, the timing of remediation accruals coincides
                        with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment
                        to a formal plan of action. Remediation liabilities are
                        accrued based on estimates of known environmental
                        exposure and are discounted in certain instances.

                        POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - The U. S. Steel Group
                        recognizes an obligation to provide postemployment
                        benefits, primarily for disability-related claims
                        covering indemnity and medical payments. The obligation
                        for these claims and the related periodic costs are
                        measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions,
                        including an appropriate discount rate, analogous to the
                        required methodology for measuring pension and other
                        postretirement benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and
                        losses are deferred and amortized over future periods.

                        INSURANCE - The U. S. Steel Group is insured for
                        catastrophic casualty and certain property and business
                        interruption exposures, as well as those risks required
                        to be insured by law or contract. Costs resulting from
                        noninsured losses are charged against income upon
                        occurrence.

                        RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications of prior
                        years' data have been made to conform to 1999
                        classifications.

3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                        Effective January 1, 1997, USX adopted American
                        Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
                        Position No. 96-1, "Environmental Remediation
                        Liabilities" (SOP 96-1), which provides additional
                        interpretation of existing accounting standards related
                        to recognition, measurement and disclosure of
                        environmental remediation liabilities. As a result of
                        adopting SOP 96-1, the U. S. Steel Group identified
                        additional environmental remediation liabilities of $35
                        million, of which $28 million was discounted to a
                        present value of $13 million and $7 million was not
                        discounted. Assumptions used in the calculation of the
                        present value amount included an inflation factor of 2%
                        and an interest rate of 7% over a range of 22 to 30
                        years. The net unfavorable effect of adoption on the
                        U. S. Steel Group's income from operations at January 1,
                        1997, was $20 million.
                             In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
                        Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                        No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
                        Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133). This new Standard
                        requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets
                        or liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 133 may result in
                        additional volatility in both current period earnings
                        and other comprehensive income as a result of recording
                        recognized and unrecognized gains and losses resulting
                        from changes in the fair value of derivative
                        instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from
                        adoption of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a
                        cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
                             Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to
                        designate certain derivative instruments as hedges even
                        if the strategy qualifies for hedge accounting
                        treatment. This approach would eliminate the
                        administrative effort needed to measure effectiveness
                        and monitor such instruments; however, this approach
                        also may result in additional volatility in current
                        period earnings.
                             USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of
                        adoption on either the financial position or results of
                        operations. It is not possible to estimate what effect
                        this Statement will have on future results of
                        operations, although greater period-to-period volatility
                        is likely. USX plans to adopt the Standard effective
                        January 1, 2001.

4. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

                        FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES - As a matter of policy, USX
                        manages most financial activities on a centralized,
                        consolidated basis. Such financial activities include
                        the investment of surplus cash; the issuance, repayment
                        and repurchase of short-term and long-term debt; the
                        issuance, repurchase and redemption of preferred stock;
                        and the issuance and repurchase of common stock.
                        Transactions related primarily to invested cash,
                        short-term and long-term debt (including convertible
                        debt), related net interest and other financial costs,
                        and preferred stock and related dividends are attributed
                        to the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and, prior
                        to November 1, 1997, the Delhi Group based upon the cash
                        flows of each group for the periods presented and the
                        initial capital structure of each group. Most financing
                        transactions are attributed to and reflected in the
                        financial statements of the groups. See Note 9, for the
                        U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX's financial
                        activities attributed to the groups. However,
                        transactions such as leases, certain collateralized
                        financings, certain indexed debt instruments, financial
                        activities of consolidated entities which are less than
                        wholly owned by USX and transactions related to
                        securities convertible solely into any one class of
                        common stock are or will be specifically attributed to
                        and reflected in their entirety in the financial
                        statements of the group to which they relate.

                        CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS - Corporate
                        general and administrative costs are allocated to the
                        U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and, prior to
                        November 1, 1997, the Delhi Group based upon utilization
                        or other methods management believes to be reasonable
                        and which consider certain measures of business
                        activities, such as employment, investments and sales.
                        The costs allocated to the U. S. Steel Group were $17
                        million in 1999, $24 million in 1998 and $33 million in
                        1997, and primarily consist of employment costs
                        including pension effects, professional services,
                        facilities and other related costs associated with
                        corporate activities.

                        INCOME TAXES - All members of the USX affiliated group
                        are included in the consolidated United States federal
                        income tax return filed by USX. Accordingly, the
                        provision for federal income taxes and the related
                        payments or refunds of tax are determined on a
                        consolidated basis. The consolidated provision and the
                        related tax payments or refunds have been reflected in
                        the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and, prior to
                        November 1, 1997, the Delhi Group financial statements
                        in accordance


                                                                            S-7



                        with USX's tax allocation policy. In general, such
                        policy provides that the consolidated tax provision and
                        related tax payments or refunds are allocated among the
                        U. S. Steel Group, Marathon Group and, prior to November
                        1, 1997, the Delhi Group, for group financial statement
                        purposes, based principally upon the financial income,
                        taxable income, credits, preferences and other amounts
                        directly related to the respective groups.
                             For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax
                        benefits resulting from attributes (principally net
                        operating losses and various tax credits), which cannot
                        be utilized by one of the groups on a separate return
                        basis but which can be utilized on a consolidated basis
                        in that year or in a carryback year, are allocated to
                        the group that generated the attributes. To the extent
                        that one of the groups is allocated a consolidated tax
                        attribute which, as a result of expiration or otherwise,
                        is not ultimately utilized on the consolidated tax
                        return, the prior years' allocation of such attribute is
                        adjusted such that the effect of the expiration is borne
                        by the group that generated the attribute. Also, if a
                        tax attribute cannot be utilized on a consolidated basis
                        in the year generated or in a carryback year, the prior
                        years' allocation of such consolidated tax effects is
                        adjusted in a subsequent year to the extent necessary to
                        allocate the tax benefits to the group that would have
                        realized the tax benefits on a separate return basis. As
                        a result, the allocated group amounts of taxes payable
                        or refundable are not necessarily comparable to those
                        that would have resulted if the groups had filed
                        separate tax returns.

5. EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES

                        In 1999, USX irrevocably deposited with a trustee the
                        entire 5.5 million common shares it owned in RTI
                        International Metals, Inc. (RTI). The deposit of the
                        shares resulted in the satisfaction of USX's obligation
                        under its 6 3/4% Exchangeable Notes (indexed debt) due
                        February 1, 2000. Under the terms of the indenture, the
                        trustee exchanged one RTI share for each note at
                        maturity. All shares were required for satisfaction of
                        the indexed debt; therefore, none reverted back to USX.
                             As a result of the above transaction, USX recorded
                        in 1999 an extraordinary loss of $5 million, net of a $3
                        million income tax benefit, representing prepaid
                        interest expense and the write-off of unamortized debt
                        issue costs, and a pretax charge of $22 million,
                        representing the difference between the carrying value
                        of the investment in RTI and the carrying value of the
                        indexed debt, which is included in net gains on disposal
                        of assets.
                             In December 1996, USX had issued $117 million of
                        notes indexed to the common share price of RTI. At
                        maturity, USX would have been required to exchange the
                        notes for shares of RTI common stock, or redeem the
                        notes for the equivalent amount of cash. Since USX's
                        investment in RTI was attributed to the U. S. Steel
                        Group, the indexed debt was also attributed to the U. S.
                        Steel Group. USX had a 26% investment in RTI and
                        accounted for its investment using the equity method of
                        accounting.
                             Republic Technologies International, LLC, an equity
                        method affiliate of USX, recorded in 1999 an
                        extraordinary loss related to the early extinguishment
                        of debt. As a result, the U. S. Steel Group recorded an
                        extraordinary loss of $2 million, net of a $1 million
                        income tax benefit, representing its share of the
                        extraordinary loss.

                                    costs. These costs primarily consist of
                                    employment costs including pension effects,
                                    professional services, facilities and other
                                    related costs associated with corporate

9. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ATTRIBUTED TO GROUPS

                        The following is the portion of USX financial activities
                        attributed to the U. S. Steel Group. These amounts
                        exclude amounts specifically attributed to the U. S.
                        Steel Group.


                        (a) For details of USX long-term debt and preferred
                            stock of subsidiary, see Notes 16 and 23,
                            respectively, to the USX consolidated financial
                            statements.
                        (b) The U. S. Steel Group's net interest and other
                            financial costs reflect weighted average effects of
                            all financial activities attributed to all groups.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. LONG-TERM DEBT

                        The U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX's consolidated
                        long-term debt is as follows:


                        (a) See Note 16, to the USX consolidated financial
                            statements for details of interest rates, maturities
                            and other terms of long-term debt.
                        (b) As described in Note 4, certain financial activities
                            are specifically attributed only to the U. S. Steel
                            Group and the Marathon Group.
                        (c) Most long-term debt activities of USX Corporation
                            and its wholly owned subsidiaries are attributed
                            to all groups (in total,  but not with respect to
                            specific debt issues) based on their respective cash
                            flows (Notes 4, 8 and 9).

                                                                            S-11



- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

                        The U. S. Steel Group has noncontributory defined
                        benefit pension plans covering substantially all
                        employees. Benefits under these plans are based upon
                        years of service and final average pensionable earnings,
                        or a minimum benefit based upon years of service,
                        whichever is greater. In addition, pension benefits are
                        also provided to most salaried employees based upon a
                        percent of total career pensionable earnings. Certain of
                        these plans provide benefits to USX corporate employees,
                        and the related costs or credits for such employees are
                        allocated to all groups (Note 4). The U. S. Steel Group
                        also participates in multiemployer plans, most of which
                        are defined benefit plans associated with coal
                        operations.
                             The U. S. Steel Group also has defined benefit
                        retiree health and life insurance plans (other benefits)
                        covering most employees upon their retirement. Health
                        benefits are provided through comprehensive hospital,
                        surgical and major medical benefit provisions or through
                        health maintenance organizations, both subject to
                        various cost sharing features. Life insurance benefits
                        are provided to nonunion retiree beneficiaries primarily
                        based on employees' annual base salary at retirement.
                        These plans provide benefits to USX corporate employees,
                        and the related costs for such employees are allocated
                        to all groups (Note 4). For union retirees, benefits are
                        provided for the most part based on fixed amounts
                        negotiated in labor contracts with the appropriate
                        unions. Except for certain life insurance benefits paid
                        from reserves held by insurance carriers and benefits
                        required to be funded by union contracts, most other
                        benefits have not been prefunded.


                        (a) Results primarily from a new five-year labor
                            contract with the United Steelworkers of America
                            ratified in August 1999.
                        (b) Represents transfers of excess pension assets to
                            fund retiree health care benefits accounts under
                            Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code.
                        (c) Includes several plans that have accumulated
                              benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

                        (d)  Additional minimum liability recorded was offset by
                             the following:


S-12




                        (a) Represents payments to a multiemployer health care
                            benefit plan created by the Coal Industry Retiree
                            Health Benefit Act of 1992 based on assigned
                            beneficiaries receiving benefits. The present value
                            of this unrecognized obligation is broadly estimated
                            to be $90 million, including the effects of future
                            medical inflation, and this amount could increase if
                            additional beneficiaries are assigned.
                        (b) Relates primarily to the 1998 voluntary early
                            retirement program.


                             For measurement purposes, a 7.5% annual rate of
                        increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
                        benefits was assumed for 2000. The rate was assumed to
                        decrease gradually to 5% for 2005 and remain at that
                        level thereafter.
                             A one-percentage-point change in assumed health
                        care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

12. INTERGROUP TRANSACTIONS

                        SALES AND PURCHASES - U. S. Steel Group sales to the
                        Marathon Group totaled $17 million in 1999 and $2
                        million in 1998. U. S. Steel Group purchases from the
                        Marathon Group totaled $41 million, $21 million and $29
                        million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At
                        December 31, 1999 and 1998, U. S. Steel Group accounts
                        payable included $5 million and $3 million,
                        respectively, related to transactions with the Marathon
                        Group. These transactions were conducted under terms
                        comparable to those with unrelated parties.

                        INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE FROM/PAYABLE TO THE MARATHON
                        GROUP - At December 31, 1999 and 1998, amounts
                        receivable or payable for income taxes were included in
                        the balance sheet as follows:


                             These amounts have been determined in accordance
                        with the tax allocation policy described in Note 4.
                        Amounts classified as current are settled in cash in the
                        year succeeding that in which such amounts are accrued.
                        Noncurrent amounts represent estimates of intergroup tax
                        effects of certain issues for years that are still under
                        various stages of audit and administrative review. Such
                        tax effects are not settled between the groups until the
                        audit of those respective tax years is closed. The
                        amounts ultimately settled for open tax years will be
                        different than recorded noncurrent amounts based on the
                        final resolution of all of the audit issues for those
                        years.

                                                                            S-13

13. INVENTORIES



                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, the
                        LIFO method accounted for 93% and 94% of total inventory
                        value. Current acquisition costs were estimated to
                        exceed the above inventory values at December 31 by
                        approximately $370 million and $310 million in 1999 and
                        1998, respectively.

14. INCOME TAXES

                        Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities
                        attributed to the U. S. Steel Group are determined in
                        accordance with the USX group tax allocation policy
                        (Note 4).
                             Provisions (credits) for estimated income taxes
                        were:



                             A reconciliation of federal statutory tax rate
                        (35%) to total provisions follows:


                             Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from
                        the following:

                        (a) USX expects to generate  sufficient future taxable
                            income to realize the benefit of the U. S. Steel
                            Group's deferred tax assets.

                             The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years
                        1990 through 1997 are under various stages of audit and
                        administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has
                        made adequate provision for income taxes and interest
                        which may become payable for years not yet settled.

15. INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES



                             Summarized financial information of affiliates
                        accounted for by the equity method of accounting
                        follows:


                             In 1999, USX and Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe Steel)
                        completed a transaction that combined the steelmaking
                        and bar producing assets of USS/Kobe Steel Company
                        (USS/Kobe) with companies controlled by Blackstone
                        Capital Partners II. The combined entity was named
                        Republic Technologies International, LLC (Republic). In
                        addition, USX made a $15 million equity investment in
                        Republic. USX owned 50% of USS/Kobe and now owns 16% of
                        Republic. USX accounts for its investment in Republic
                        under the equity method of accounting. Income (loss)
                        from affiliates in 1999 includes $47 million in charges
                        related to the impairment of the carrying value of USX's
                        investment in USS/Kobe and costs related to the
                        formation of Republic. The seamless pipe business of
                        USS/Kobe was excluded from this transaction. That
                        business, now known as Lorain Tubular Company, LLC,
                        became a wholly owned subsidiary of USX at the close of
                        business on December 31, 1999.
                             Dividends and partnership distributions received
                        from equity affiliates were $2 million in 1999, $19
                        million in 1998 and $13 million in 1997.
                             U. S. Steel Group purchases of transportation
                        services and semi-finished steel from equity affiliates
                        totaled $361 million, $331 million and $424 million in
                        1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At December 31, 1999
                        and 1998, U. S. Steel Group payables to these affiliates
                        totaled $22 million and $15 million, respectively. U. S.
                        Steel Group sales of steel and raw materials to equity
                        affiliates totaled $831 million, $725 million and $802
                        million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At
                        December 31, 1999 and 1998, U. S. Steel Group
                        receivables from these affiliates were $177 million.
                        Generally, these transactions were conducted under
                        long-term, market-based contractual arrangements.

16. LEASES

                        Future minimum commitments for capital leases (including
                        sale-leasebacks accounted for as financings) and for
                        operating leases having remaining noncancelable lease
                        terms in excess of one year are as follows:



                                                                            S-15



                             Operating lease rental expense:



                             The U. S. Steel Group leases a wide variety of
                        facilities and equipment under operating leases,
                        including land and building space, office equipment,
                        production facilities and transportation equipment. Most
                        long-term leases include renewal options and, in certain
                        leases, purchase options. In the event of a change in
                        control of USX, as defined in the agreements, or certain
                        other circumstances, lease obligations totaling
                        $1 million may be declared immediately due and payable.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT



                             Amounts in accumulated depreciation, depletion and
                        amortization for assets acquired under capital leases
                        (including sale-leasebacks accounted for as financings)
                        were $81 million and $77 million at December 31, 1999
                        and 1998, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

                        In 1997, USX exchanged approximately 3.9 million 6.75%
                        Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (Trust
                        Preferred Securities) of USX Capital Trust I, a Delaware
                        statutory business trust (Trust), for an equivalent
                        number of shares of its 6.50% Cumulative Convertible
                        Preferred Stock (6.50% Preferred Stock) (Exchange). The
                        Exchange resulted in the recording of Trust Preferred
                        Securities at a fair value of $182 million and a noncash
                        credit to Retained Earnings of $10 million.
                             USX owns all of the common securities of the Trust,
                        which was formed for the purpose of the Exchange. (The
                        Trust Common Securities and the Trust Preferred
                        Securities are together referred to as the Trust
                        Securities.) The Trust Securities represent undivided
                        beneficial ownership interests in the assets of the
                        Trust, which consist solely of USX 6.75% Convertible
                        Junior Subordinated Debentures maturing March 31, 2037
                        (Debentures), having an aggregate principal amount equal
                        to the aggregate initial liquidation amount ($50.00 per
                        security and $203 million in total) of the Trust
                        Securities issued by the Trust. Interest and principal
                        payments on the Debentures will be used to make
                        quarterly distributions and to pay redemption and
                        liquidation amounts on the Trust Preferred Securities.
                        The quarterly distributions, which accumulate at the
                        rate of 6.75% per annum on the Trust Preferred
                        Securities and the accretion from fair value to the
                        initial liquidation amount, are charged to income and
                        included in net interest and other financial costs.
                             Under the terms of the Debentures, USX has the
                        right to defer payment of interest for up to 20
                        consecutive quarters and, as a consequence, monthly
                        distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will be
                        deferred during such period. If USX exercises this
                        right, then, subject to limited exceptions, it may not
                        pay any dividend or make any distribution with respect
                        to any shares of its capital stock.

S-16



                             The Trust Preferred Securities are convertible at
                        any time prior to the close of business on March 31,
                        2037 (unless such right is terminated earlier under
                        certain circumstances) at the option of the holder, into
                        shares of Steel Stock at a conversion price of $46.25
                        per share of Steel Stock (equivalent to a conversion
                        ratio of 1.081 shares of Steel Stock for each Trust
                        Preferred Security), subject to adjustment in certain
                        circumstances.
                             The Trust Preferred Securities may be redeemed at
                        any time at the option of USX, at a premium of 102.60%
                        of the initial liquidation amount through March 31,
                        2000, and thereafter, declining annually to the initial
                        liquidation amount on April 1, 2003, and thereafter.
                        They are mandatorily redeemable at March 31, 2037, or
                        earlier under certain circumstances.
                             Payments related to quarterly distributions and to
                        the payment of redemption and liquidation amounts on the
                        Trust Preferred Securities by the Trust are guaranteed
                        by USX on a subordinated basis. In addition, USX
                        unconditionally guarantees the Trust's Debentures. The
                        obligations of USX under the Debentures, and the related
                        indenture, trust agreement and guarantee constitute a
                        full and unconditional guarantee by USX of the Trust's
                        obligations under the Trust Preferred Securities.

19. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



                       (a) See page U-7 of the USX consolidated financial
                           statements relative to the annual activity of these
                           adjustments. Total comprehensive income for the U. S.
                           Steel Group for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $59
                           million, $357 million and $444 million, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. DIVIDENDS

                        In accordance with the USX Restated Certificate of
                        Incorporation, dividends on the Steel Stock and Marathon
                        Stock are limited to the legally available funds of USX.
                        Net losses of either Group, as well as dividends and
                        distributions on any class of USX Common Stock or series
                        of preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX
                        Common Stock or series of preferred stock at prices in
                        excess of par or stated value, will reduce the funds of
                        USX legally available for payment of dividends on both
                        classes of Common Stock. Subject to this limitation, the
                        Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends
                        on the Steel Stock based on the financial condition and
                        results of operations of the U. S. Steel Group, although
                        it has no obligation under Delaware law to do so. In
                        making its dividend decisions with respect to Steel
                        Stock, the Board of Directors considers, among other
                        things, the long-term earnings and cash flow
                        capabilities of the U. S. Steel Group as well as the
                        dividend policies of similar publicly traded steel
                        companies.
                             Dividends on the Steel Stock are further limited to
                        the Available Steel Dividend Amount. At December 31,
                        1999, the Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least
                        $3,300 million. The Available Steel Dividend Amount will
                        be increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect
                        U. S. Steel Group net income, dividends, repurchases or
                        issuances with respect to the Steel Stock and preferred
                        stock attributed to the U. S. Steel Group and certain
                        other items.

                                                                            S-17

21. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                        The method of calculating net income per share for the
                        Steel Stock, the Marathon Stock and, prior to November
                        1, 1997, the Delhi Stock reflects the USX Board of
                        Directors' intent that the separately reported earnings
                        and surplus of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group
                        and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                        USX Restated Certificate of Incorporation, are available
                        for payment of dividends to the respective classes of
                        stock, although legally available funds and liquidation
                        preferences of these classes of stock do not necessarily
                        correspond with these amounts.
                             Basic net income per share is calculated by
                        adjusting net income for dividend requirements of
                        preferred stock and, in 1997, the noncash credit on
                        exchange of preferred stock and is based on the weighted
                        average number of common shares outstanding.
                             Diluted net income per share assumes conversion of
                        convertible securities for the applicable periods
                        outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options,
                        provided in each case, the effect is not antidilutive.



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AND STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

                        USX Stock-Based Compensation Plans and Stockholder
                        Rights Plan are discussed in Note 19, and Note 21,
                        respectively, to the USX consolidated financial
                        statements.
                             The U. S. Steel Group's actual stock-based
                        compensation expense was $1 million in 1999, none in
                        1998 and $8 million in 1997. Incremental compensation
                        expense, as determined under a fair value model, was not
                        material ($.02 or less per share for all years
                        presented). Therefore, pro forma net income and earnings
                        per share data have been omitted.

23. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

                        The U. S. Steel Group remains at risk for possible
                        changes in the market value of the derivative
                        instrument; however, such risk should be mitigated by
                        price changes in the underlying hedged item. The U. S.
                        Steel Group is also exposed to credit risk in the event
                        of nonperformance by counterparties. The credit
                        worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing
                        review, including the use of master netting agreements
                        to the extent practical, and full performance is
                        anticipated.

                             The following table sets forth quantitative
                        information by class of derivative instrument:



                        (a) The fair value amounts are based on exchange-traded
                            index prices and dealer quotes.
                        (b) Contract or notional amounts do not quantify risk
                            exposure, but are used in the calculation of cash
                            settlements under the contracts.
                        (c) The OTC swap arrangements vary in duration with
                            certain contracts extending into 2000.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                        Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein
                        is not necessarily representative of the amount that
                        could be realized or settled, nor does the fair value
                        amount consider the tax consequences of realization or
                        settlement. The following table summarizes financial
                        instruments, excluding derivative financial instruments
                        disclosed in Note 23, by individual balance sheet
                        account. As described in Note 4, the U. S. Steel Group's
                        specifically attributed financial instruments and the U.
                        S. Steel Group's portion of USX's financial instruments
                        attributed to all groups are as follows:



                             Fair value of financial instruments classified as
                        current assets or liabilities approximates carrying
                        value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
                        Fair value of investments and long-term receivables was
                        based on discounted cash flows or other specific
                        instrument analysis. Fair value of preferred stock of
                        subsidiary and trust preferred securities was based on
                        market prices. Fair value of long-term debt instruments
                        was based on market prices where available or current
                        borrowing rates available for financings with similar
                        terms and maturities.

                             The U. S. Steel Group's unrecognized financial
                        instruments consist of receivables sold in 1998 and
                        financial guarantees. It is not practicable to estimate
                        the fair value of these forms of financial instrument
                        obligations because there are no quoted market prices
                        for transactions which are similar in nature. For
                        details relating to financial guarantees, see Note 25.

25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

                        USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending
                        or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                        commitments relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving
                        a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
                        relating to the environment. Certain of these matters
                        are discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these
                        contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                        be material to the U. S. Steel Group financial
                        statements. However, management believes that USX will
                        remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though
                        it is possible that these contingencies could be
                        resolved unfavorably to the U. S. Steel Group.

                        ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -

                             The U. S. Steel Group is subject to federal, state,
                        and local laws and regulations relating to the
                        environment. These laws generally provide for control of
                        pollutants released into the environment and require
                        responsible parties to undertake remediation of
                        hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed
                        for noncompliance. Accrued liabilities for remediation
                        totaled $101 million and $97 million at December 31,
                        1999 and 1998, respectively. It is not presently
                        possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all
                        remediation costs that might be incurred or the
                        penalties that may be imposed.

                             For a number of years, the U. S. Steel Group has
                        made substantial capital expenditures to bring existing
                        facilities into compliance with various laws relating to
                        the environment. In 1999 and 1998, such capital
                        expenditures totaled $32 million and $49 million,
                        respectively. The U. S. Steel Group anticipates making
                        additional such expenditures in the future; however, the
                        exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
                        uncertain because of the continuing evolution of
                        specific regulatory requirements.

                        GUARANTEES -

                             Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated
                        entities of the U. S. Steel Group totaled $88 million at
                        December 31, 1999, and $81 million at December 31, 1998.
                        In the event that any defaults of guaranteed liabilities
                        occur, USX has access to its interest in the assets of
                        the affiliates to reduce potential U. S. Steel Group
                        losses resulting from these guarantees. As of December
                        31, 1999, the largest guarantee for a single affiliate
                        was $61 million.

                        COMMITMENTS -

                             At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the U. S. Steel
                        Group's contract commitments to acquire property, plant
                        and equipment totaled $83 million and $188 million,
                        respectively.

                             USX entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
                        in 1993, which requires the U. S. Steel Group to accept
                        pulverized coal each month or pay a minimum monthly
                        charge of approximately $1 million. Charges for
                        deliveries of pulverized coal totaled $23 million in
                        both 1999 and 1998. If USX elects to terminate the
                        contract early, a maximum termination payment of $102
                        million, which declines over the duration of the
                        agreement, may be required.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                            The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, which is
                        engaged in the production and sale of steel mill
                        products, coke, and taconite pellets; the management of
                        mineral resources; domestic coal mining; real estate
                        development; and engineering and consulting services.
                        Certain business activities are conducted through joint
                        ventures and partially owned companies, such as
                        USS-POSCO Industries ("USS-POSCO"), PRO-TEC Coating
                        Company ("PRO-TEC"), Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar"),
                        Clairton 1314B Partnership, Republic Technologies
                        International, LLC ("Republic") and VSZ U. S. Steel,
                        s.r.o. Management's Discussion and Analysis should be
                        read in conjunction with the U. S. Steel Group's
                        Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements.

                            In 1999, segment income for U. S. Steel operations
                        decreased primarily due to lower average steel product
                        prices, unfavorable product mix, and lower income from
                        affiliates.

                            Certain sections of Management's Discussion and
                        Analysis include forward-looking statements concerning
                        trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of
                        the U. S. Steel Group. These statements typically
                        contain words such as "anticipates," "believes,"
                        "estimates," "expects" or similar words indicating that
                        future outcomes are not known with certainty and subject
                        to risk factors that could cause these outcomes to
                        differ significantly from those projected. In accordance
                        with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities
                        Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are
                        accompanied by cautionary language identifying important
                        factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that
                        could cause future outcomes to differ materially from
                        those set forth in forward-looking statements. For
                        additional risk factors affecting the businesses of the

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

                            REVENUES for each of the last three years are
                       summarized in the following table.


                        (a) Includes revenue from the sale of steel production
                            by-products, engineering and consulting services,
                            real estate development and resource management.

                            Total revenues decreased by $969 million in 1999
                        from 1998 primarily due to lower average realized prices
                        and lower income from affiliates, which included a $47
                        million charge for the impairment of U. S. Steel's
                        investment in USS/Kobe Steel Company. Net gain on
                        disposal of assets in 1999 included a $22 million charge
                        representing the difference between the carrying value
                        of the investment in RTI International Metals, Inc.
                        ("RTI") and the carrying value of indexed debt (for
                        additional information, see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel
                        Group Financial Statements). Total revenues in 1998
                        decreased by $658 million from 1997 primarily due to
                        lower average realized prices, lower steel shipment
                        volumes, and lower income from affiliates.

                                                                           S-25


                            INCOME FROM OPERATIONS for the U. S. Steel Group for
                       the last three years was:


                        (a) Includes income from the production and sale of
                            steel mill products, coke and taconite pellets; the
                            management of mineral resources; domestic coal
                            mining; real estate development; and engineering and
                            consulting services.
                        (b) Includes the portion of postretirement benefit costs
                            and certain other expenses principally attributable
                            to former business units of the U. S. Steel Group.
                            Results in 1997 included charges of $9 million
                            related to environmental accruals and the adoption
                            of SOP 96-1.

                            SEGMENT INCOME FOR U. S. STEEL OPERATIONS

                            U. S. Steel operations recorded a segment loss of
                        $128 million in 1999 versus segment income of $330
                        million in 1998, a decrease of $458 million. The 1999
                        segment loss included a $10 million charge for certain
                        environmental accruals, a $7 million charge for certain
                        legal accruals and $7 million in various non-recurring
                        equity affiliate charges. Results in 1998 included a net
                        favorable $30 million for an insurance litigation
                        settlement and charges of $10 million related to a
                        voluntary workforce reduction plan. In addition to the
                        effects of these items, the decrease in segment income
                        in 1999 for U. S. Steel operations was primarily due to
                        lower average steel prices, lower income from raw
                        materials operations, unfavorable product mix, higher
                        pension costs and lower income from affiliates.

                            High levels of imports and weak tubular markets
                        continued to negatively affect steel product prices and
                        steel shipment levels in 1999 as they did in 1998. U. S.
                        Steel's average realized price declined 10% in 1999
                        compared to 1998 from $469 per ton to $420 per ton. In
                        1999, raw steel capability utilization averaged 94%,
                        compared to 88% in 1998 and 97% in 1997.

                            Segment income for U. S. Steel operations in 1998
                        decreased $288 million from 1997. Segment income in 1998
                        and 1997 included insurance recoveries of $30 million
                        and $40 million, respectively, due to blast furnace
                        incidents in 1995 and 1996 at Gary Works. Results in
                        1997 included a $15 million gain on the sale of the
                        plate mill at U. S. Steel's former Texas Works. In
                        addition to the effects of these items, the decrease in
                        segment income in 1998 for U. S. Steel operations was
                        primarily due to lower average steel prices, lower
                        shipments, less efficient operating levels, the cost
                        effects of a 10 day outage at Gary Works No. 13 blast
                        furnace following a tap hole failure, and lower income
                        from affiliates. These unfavorable items were partially
                        offset by lower 1998 accruals for profit sharing.

                            Segment income for U. S. Steel operations included
                        pension costs (which are primarily noncash) allocated to
                        the ongoing operations of U. S. Steel of $219 million,
                        $187 million, and $169 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                        respectively. Pension costs in 1998 included $10 million
                        for termination benefits associated to a voluntary early
                        retirement program.

                            ITEM NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENT: Pension credits
                        associated with pension plan assets and liabilities
                        allocated to pre-1987 retirees and former businesses are
                        not included in segment income for U. S. Steel
                        operations. These pension credits, which are primarily
                        noncash, totaled $447 million in 1999, compared to $373
                        million and $313 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
                        Pension credits in 1999 included $35 million for a
                        one-time favorable pension settlement primarily related
                        to the voluntary early retirement program for salaried
                        employees.

                            Pension credits, combined with pension costs
                        included in segment income for U. S. Steel operations,
                        resulted in net pension credits of $228 million in 1999,
                        $186 million in 1998 and $144 million in 1997. Net
                        pension credits are expected to be approximately $270
                        million in 2000. Also in 2000, U. S. Steel's main
                        pension plans' transition asset will be fully amortized,
                        decreasing the pension credit by $69 million annually in
                        future years for this component. Future net pension
                        credits can vary depending upon the market performance
                        of plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions
                        regarding such factors as the selection of a discount
                        rate and rate of return on plan assets, changes in the
                        amortization levels of transition amounts or prior
                        period service costs, plan amendments affecting benefit
                        payout levels and profile changes in the beneficiary
                        populations being valued. Changes in any of these
                        factors could cause net pension credits to change. To
                        the extent net pension credits decline in the future,
                        income from operations would be adversely affected. For
                        additional information on pensions, see Note 11 to the
                        U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                            NET INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS for each of
                        the last three years are summarized in the following
                        table:


                       (a) In December 1996, USX issued $117 million of 6-3/4%
                           Exchangeable Notes Due February 1, 2000 ("Indexed
                           Debt") indexed to the price of RTI common stock. The
                           carrying value of Indexed Debt was adjusted quarterly
                           to settlement value, based on changes in the value of
                           RTI common stock. Any resulting adjustment was
                           credited to income and included in interest and other
                           financial costs. For further discussion of Indexed
                           Debt, see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
                           Statements.

                            Adjusted net interest and other financial costs were
                        $87 million in 1999 as compared with $86 million in
                        1998. Adjusted net interest and other financial costs
                        decreased by $11 million in 1998 as compared with 1997,
                        due primarily to a lower average debt level.

                            The PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1999
                        decreased compared to 1998 due to a decline in income
                        from operations. The provision for estimated income
                        taxes in 1998 decreased compared to 1997 due to a
                        decline in income from operations and a $9 million
                        favorable foreign tax adjustment in 1998 as a result of
                        a favorable resolution of foreign tax litigation. For
                        further discussion on income taxes, see Note 14 to the
                        U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                            The EXTRAORDINARY LOSS on extinguishment of debt of
                        $7 million, net of income tax benefit, in 1999 includes
                        a $5 million loss resulting from the satisfaction of the
                        indexed debt and a $2 million loss that was U. S.
                        Steel's share of Republic's extraordinary loss related
                        to the early extinguishment of debt. For additional
                        information, see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group
                        Financial Statements.

                                                                           S-27


                            NET INCOME in 1999 was $44 million, compared with
                        $364 million in 1998 and $452 million in 1997. Net
                        income decreased $320 million in 1999 from 1998, and
                        decreased $88 million in 1998 from 1997. The decreases
                        in net income primarily reflect the factors discussed
                        above.

                            NONCASH CREDIT FROM EXCHANGE OF PREFERRED STOCK
                        totaled $10 million in 1997. On May 16, 1997, USX
                        exchanged approximately 3.9 million 6.75% Convertible
                        Quarterly Income Preferred Securities ("Trust Preferred
                        Securities") of USX Capital Trust I, for an equivalent
                        number of shares of its outstanding 6.50% Cumulative
                        Convertible Preferred Stock ("6.50% Preferred Stock").
                        The noncash credit from exchange of preferred stock
                        represents the difference between the carrying value of
                        the 6.50% Preferred Stock ($192 million) and the fair
                        value of the Trust Preferred Securities of USX Capital
                        Trust I ($182 million), at the date of the exchange. For
                        additional discussion on the exchange, see Note 18 to
                        the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND
LIQUIDITY

                            CURRENT ASSETS at year-end 1999 increased $706
                        million from year-end 1998 primarily due to higher trade
                        receivables (including the effects of the expiration in
                        1999 of a program to sell accounts receivables), higher
                        deferred income taxes, the recording of an inter-group
                        income tax receivable and the purchase of Kobe Steel,
                        Ltd.'s 50% membership interest and consolidation of
                        Lorain Tubular Company, LLC.

                            CURRENT LIABILITIES in 1999 increased $250 million
                        from 1998 primarily due to increased accounts payable
                        impacted by costs associated with higher production
                        levels in the latter part of 1999 compared with the same
                        1998 period, and the purchase of Kobe Steel, Ltd.'s 50%
                        membership interest and consolidation in 1999 of Lorain
                        Tubular Company, LLC.

                            TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December
                        31, 1999 of $915 million was $426 million higher than
                        year-end 1998. This increase was largely due to the
                        replacement of a $350 million accounts receivable
                        program, which was accounted for as a sale of accounts
                        receivable, with a facility of the same size now
                        accounted for as a secured borrowing. For additional
                        discussion on the facility, see Note 16 to the USX
                        Corporation Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding
                        the impact of the replacement of the receivables
                        program, the increase in debt was primarily due to lower
                        cash flow provided from operating activities partially
                        offset by reduced net cash used in investing activities
                        and the satisfaction of indexed debt. For further
                        discussion of indexed debt, see Note 5 to the U. S.
                        Steel Group Financial Statements. Virtually all of the
                        debt is a direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by,
                        USX.

                            NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES in 1999 was
                        $80 million including a net payment of $320 million upon
                        the expiration of the accounts receivable program
                        discussed above and a payment of $20 million to the
                        United Steelworkers of America ("USWA") Voluntary
                        Employee Benefit Association Trust ("VEBA"). Net cash
                        provided from operating activities was $380 million in
                        1998 and included proceeds of $38 million for the
                        insurance litigation settlement pertaining to the 1995
                        Gary Works No. 8 blast furnace explosion and the payment
                        of $30 million for the repurchase of sold accounts
                        receivable. Excluding these non-recurring items in both
                        years, net cash provided from operating activities
                        decreased $112 million in 1999 due mainly to decreased
                        profitability.

S-28


                            The U. S. Steel Group's net cash provided from
                        operating activities in 1997 included payments of $80
                        million in elective funding of retiree life insurance of
                        union and nonunion participants, $70 million to the USWA
                        VEBA, $49 million to fund the U. S. Steel Group's
                        principal pension plan for the 1996 plan year and
                        receipts of $40 million in insurance recoveries related
                        to the 1996 Gary Works No. 13 hearth breakout. Excluding
                        these items, net cash provided from operating activities
                        decreased $263 million in 1998 due mainly to decreased
                        profitability and unfavorable working capital changes.

                            CAPITAL EXPENDITURES in 1999 included the completion
                        of the new 64" pickle line at Mon Valley Works; the
                        replacement of three coilers at the Gary hot strip mill,
                        one of which was installed in 1999; an upgrade to the
                        Mon Valley cold rolling mill; replacement of coke
                        battery thruwalls at Gary Works; several projects at
                        Gary Works allowing for production of specialized high
                        strength steels, primarily for the automotive market;
                        and completion of the conversion of the Fairfield
                        pipemill to use rounds instead of square blooms. Capital
                        expenditures in 1998 included a reline of the Gary Works
                        No. 6 blast furnace, an upgrade to the galvanizing line
                        at Fairless Works, replacement of coke battery thruwalls
                        at Gary Works, conversion of the Fairfield pipemill to
                        use rounds and additional environmental expenditures
                        primarily at Fairfield Works and Gary Works. Capital
                        expenditures in 1997 included a blast furnace reline at
                        Mon Valley Works, a new heat treat line for plates at
                        Gary Works and additional environmental expenditures
                        primarily at Gary Works. Contract commitments for
                        capital expenditures at year-end 1999 were $83 million,
                        compared with $188 million at year-end 1998.

                            Capital expenditures for 2000 are expected to be
                        approximately $230 million including continued coke
                        battery thruwall repairs at Gary Works, installation of
                        the remaining two coilers at Gary's hot strip mill, a
                        blast furnace stove replacement at Gary Works and a Mon
                        Valley cold mill upgrade.

                            The preceding statement concerning expected 2000
                        capital expenditures is a forward-looking statement.
                        This forward-looking statement is based on assumptions,
                        which can be affected by (among other things) levels of
                        cash flow from operations, whether or not assets are
                        purchased or financed by operating leases, unforeseen
                        hazards such as weather conditions, explosions or fires,
                        and delays in obtaining government or partner approval,
                        which could delay the timing of completion of particular
                        capital projects. Accordingly, actual results may differ
                        materially from current expectations in the
                        forward-looking statement.

                            INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES in 1999 of $15 million was
                        an investment in Republic. Investments in affiliates in
                        1998 of $73 million mainly reflects funding for entry
                        into a joint venture in the Slovak Republic with VSZ
                        a.s. ("VSZ"). Investments in affiliates in 1997 of $26
                        million included funding of equity affiliate capital
                        projects (mainly the construction of a second
                        galvanizing line at PRO-TEC).

                            CASH FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS totaled $10 million in
                        1999, compared with $21 million in 1998 and $420 million
                        in 1997. The 1997 proceeds included $361 million from
                        U. S. Steel's entry into a strategic partnership with
                        two limited partners to acquire an interest in three
                        coke batteries at its Clairton Works and $15 million
                        from the sale of the plate mill at the U. S. Steel
                        Group's former Texas Works.

                                                                           S-29


                            FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS increased by $486 million and
                        $9 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively, and decreased
                        $567 million in 1997. Financial obligations consist of
                        the U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX debt and
                        preferred stock of a subsidiary attributed to both
                        groups as well as debt and financing agreements
                        specifically attributed to the U. S. Steel Group. The
                        increase in 1999 primarily reflected the net effects of
                        cash used in operating and investing activities and
                        dividend payments. The decrease in 1997 primarily
                        reflected the net effects of cash from operating
                        activities, asset sales and capital expenditures. For a

                        PENSION ACTIVITY

                            USX contributed $49 million in 1997 to fund the
                        U.S. Steel Group's principal pension plan for the 1996
                        plan year.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

                            The U. S. Steel Group has incurred and will continue
                        to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance,
                        and remediation expenditures as a result of
                        environmental laws and regulations. In recent years,
                        these expenditures have been mainly for process changes
                        in order to meet Clean Air Act obligations, although
                        ongoing compliance costs have also been significant. To
                        the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are
                        not ultimately reflected in the prices of the U. S.
                        Steel Group's products and services, operating results
                        will be adversely affected. The U. S. Steel Group
                        believes that all of its domestic competitors are
                        subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.
                        However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
                        depending on a number of factors, including the age and
                        location of its operating facilities, marketing areas,
                        production processes and the specific products and
                        services it provides. To the extent that competitors are
                        not required to undertake equivalent costs in their
                        operations, the competitive position of the U. S. Steel
                        Group could be adversely affected.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                            The U. S. Steel Group's environmental expenditures
                       for the last three years were(a):


                        (a) Based on previously established U. S. Department of
                            Commerce survey guidelines.
                        (b) These amounts include spending charged against such
                            reserves, net of recoveries where permissible, but
                            do not include noncash provisions recorded for
                            environmental remediation.

                            The U. S. Steel Group's environmental capital
                        expenditures accounted for 11%, 16% and 16% of total
                        capital expenditures in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                        respectively.

                            Compliance expenditures represented 4% of the U. S.
                        Steel Group's total costs and expenses in 1999, 1998 and
                        1997. Remediation spending during 1997 to 1999 was
                        mainly related to remediation activities at former and
                        present operating locations. These projects include
                        continuing remediation at an IN SITU uranium mining
                        operation and former coke-making facilities and the
                        closure of permitted hazardous and non-hazardous waste
                        landfills.

                            The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA")
                        establishes standards for the management of solid and
                        hazardous wastes. Besides affecting current waste
                        disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the
                        environmental effects of certain past waste disposal
                        operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation
                        of storage tanks.

                            The U. S. Steel Group is in the study phase of RCRA
                        corrective action programs at its Fairless Works and its
                        former Geneva Works. A RCRA corrective action program
                        has been initiated at its Gary Works and its Fairfield
                        Works. Until the studies are completed at these
                        facilities, USX is unable to estimate the total cost of
                        remediation activities that will be required.

                            USX has been notified that it is a potential
                        responsible party ("PRP") at 26 waste sites related to
                        the U. S. Steel Group under the Comprehensive
                        Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
                        ("CERCLA") as of December 31, 1999. In addition, there
                        are 12 sites related to the U. S. Steel Group where USX
                        has received information requests or other indications
                        that USX may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient
                        information is not presently available to confirm the
                        existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
                        amount thereof. There are also 32 additional sites
                        related to the U. S. Steel Group where remediation is
                        being sought under other environmental statutes, both
                        federal and state, or where private parties are seeking
                        remediation through discussions or litigation. At many
                        of these sites, USX is one of a number of parties
                        involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as
                        USX's share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the
                        outcome of investigations and remedial studies. The
                        U.S. Steel Group accrues for environmental remediation
                        activities when the responsibility to remediate is
                        probable and the amount of associated costs is
                        reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation
                        matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as
                        additional remediation obligations arise, charges in
                        excess of those previously accrued may be required. See
                        Note 25 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                                                                           S-31


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                            In 1998, USX entered into a consent decree with the
                        Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") which resolved
                        alleged violations of the Clean Water Act National
                        Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit
                        at Gary Works and provides for a sediment remediation
                        project for a section of the Grand Calumet River that
                        runs through Gary Works. Contemporaneously, USX entered
                        into a consent decree with the public trustees which
                        resolves potential liability for natural resource
                        damages on the same section of the Grand Calumet River.
                        In 1999, USX paid civil penalties of $2.9 million for
                        the alleged water act violations and $0.5 million in
                        natural resource damages assessment costs. In addition,
                        USX will pay the public trustees $1 million at the end
                        of the remediation project for future monitoring costs
                        and USX is obligated to purchase and restore several
                        parcels of property that have been or will be conveyed
                        to the trustees. During the negotiations leading up to
                        the settlement with EPA, capital improvements were made
                        to upgrade plant systems to comply with the NPDES
                        requirements. The sediment remediation project is an
                        approved final interim measure under the corrective
                        action program for Gary Works and is expected to cost
                        approximately $30 million over the next six years.
                        Estimated remediation and monitoring costs for this
                        project have been accrued.

                            In addition, remediation of contaminated sediments
                        in the Gary Vessel Slip has been implemented as an
                        interim measure under the corrective action program. The
                        work is completed and is expected to cost $2.5 million.

                            New or expanded environmental requirements, which
                        could increase the U. S. Steel Group's environmental
                        costs, may arise in the future. USX intends to comply
                        with all legal requirements regarding the environment,
                        but since many of them are not fixed or presently
                        determinable (even under existing legislation) and may
                        be affected by future legislation, it is not possible to
                        predict accurately the ultimate cost of compliance,
                        including remediation costs which may be incurred and
                        penalties which may be imposed. However, based on
                        presently available information, and existing laws and
                        regulations as currently implemented, the U. S. Steel
                        Group does not anticipate that environmental compliance
                        expenditures (including operating and maintenance and
                        remediation) will materially increase in 2000. The U. S.
                        Steel Group's capital expenditures for environmental are
                        expected to be approximately $27 million in 2000 and are
                        expected to be spent on projects primarily at Gary Works
                        and Fairfield Works. Predictions beyond 2000 can only be
                        broad-based estimates which have varied, and will
                        continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of
                        specific regulatory requirements, the possible
                        imposition of more stringent requirements and the
                        availability of new technologies to remediate sites,
                        among other matters. Based upon currently identified
                        projects, the U. S. Steel Group anticipates that
                        environmental capital expenditures will be approximately
                        $16 million in 2001; however, actual expenditures may
                        vary as the number and scope of environmental projects
                        are revised as a result of improved technology or
                        changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if
                        additional projects are identified or additional
                        requirements are imposed.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                            USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of
                        pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                        commitments relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving
                        a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
                        relating to the environment, certain of which are
                        discussed in Note 25 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
                        Statements. The ultimate resolution of these
                        contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                        be material to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
                        Statements. However, management believes that USX will
                        remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though
                        it is possible that these contingencies could be
                        resolved unfavorably to the U. S. Steel Group.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

                            In 1999, average realized steel prices and steel
                        shipments continued to be negatively impacted by the
                        ongoing effects of steel imports and weak plate and
                        tubular markets.

                            Average realized steel prices were 10.4% lower in
                        1999 versus 1998 due primarily to U. S. Steel realizing
                        lower prices on most products. In 1999, average realized
                        steel prices on sheet products were 7.8% lower versus
                        1998.

                            Steel shipments were 10.6 million tons in 1999, 10.7
                        million tons in 1998, and 11.6 million tons in 1997.
                        U.S. Steel Group shipments comprised approximately
                        10.1% of the domestic steel market in 1999. In 1999 and
                        1998, U. S. Steel shipments were negatively affected by
                        an increase in imports and weak tubular markets.
                        Exports accounted for approximately 3% of U. S. Steel
                        Group shipments in 1999 and 4% in both 1998 and 1997.

                            Raw steel production was 12.0 million tons in 1999,
                        compared with 11.2 million tons in 1998 and 12.3 million
                        tons in 1997. Raw steel production averaged 94% of
                        capability in 1999, compared with 88% of capability in
                        1998 and 97% of capability in 1997. In 1998, raw steel
                        production was negatively affected by a planned reline
                        at Gary Works No. 6 blast furnace, an unplanned blast
                        furnace outage at the Gary Works No. 13 blast furnace,
                        and the idling of certain facilities as a result of the
                        increase in imports. Because of market conditions, U. S.
                        Steel Group curtailed its production by keeping the Gary
                        Works No. 6 blast furnace out of service until February
                        1999, after a scheduled reline was completed in
                        mid-August 1998. In addition, raw steel production was
                        cut back at Mon Valley Works and Fairfield Works during
                        1998. U. S. Steel's stated annual raw steel production
                        capability was 12.8 million tons in 1999, 1998 and 1997.

                            On September 30, 1998, U. S. Steel joined with 11
                        other producers, the USWA and the Independent
                        Steelworkers Union ("ISU") to file trade cases against
                        hot-rolled carbon steel products from Japan, Russia, and
                        Brazil. A final antidumping ("AD") order against Japan
                        was issued on June 23, 1999. In the cases against
                        Brazil, on July 7, 1999, the U. S. Department of
                        Commerce ("Commerce") announced final countervailing
                        ("CVD") and AD duty determinations and,
                        contemporaneously, announced that it had entered into
                        agreements with Brazil to suspend the investigations. In
                        the case against Russia, on July 13, 1999, Commerce
                        announced final AD duty determinations and,
                        contemporaneously, announced that it had entered into an
                        agreement with Russia to suspend the investigation. In
                        addition, Commerce announced that it had also entered
                        into a comprehensive agreement concerning all steel
                        product imports from Russia except for plate products

                                                                           S-33


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                        and hot-rolled products. Plate products from Russia are
                        subject to a suspension agreement signed in 1997. On
                        August 16, 1999, U. S. Steel, along with four other
                        integrated domestic producers, filed appeals with the
                        U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the
                        hot-rolled carbon steel suspension agreements with
                        Brazil and Russia.

                            On February 16, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with four
                        other producers and the USWA to file trade cases against
                        eight countries (Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia,
                        Macedonia, the Czech Republic, France, and Italy)
                        concerning imports of cut-to-length plate products. AD
                        cases were filed against all the countries and CVD duty
                        cases were filed against all of the countries except
                        Japan and the Czech Republic. On April 2, 1999, the
                        U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") determined
                        that the volume of imports from Macedonia and the Czech
                        Republic were negligible thereby terminating the
                        investigations as to those countries. On February 11,
                        2000, final AD orders were issued against all the
                        remaining countries, and final CVD orders were issued in
                        all of the remaining CVD cases.

                            On June 2, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with eight other
                        producers, the USWA and the ISU to file trade cases
                        against twelve countries (Argentina, Brazil, China,
                        Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Slovakia,
                        Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela) concerning
                        imports of cold-rolled sheet products. AD cases were
                        filed against all the countries and CVD duty cases were
                        filed against Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and
                        Venezuela. On July 19, 1999, the ITC issued its
                        preliminary determination that the domestic industry was
                        being injured or threatened with injury as the result of
                        imports from all of the countries. It decided, however,
                        to discontinue the investigations of subsidies on
                        imports from Indonesia, Thailand, and Venezuela. After
                        having found preliminary margins against each of the
                        countries in each of the remaining cases, Commerce has
                        announced final AD margins against Argentina, Brazil,
                        Japan, Russia, South Africa, and Thailand, and final CVD
                        margins against Brazil. Final decisions from Commerce as
                        to the remaining countries are expected in the first
                        half of 2000. Commerce has announced that it has entered
                        into an agreement with Russia to suspend the
                        investigation. After a final injury hearing, on March
                        3, 2000, the ITC determined that the imports from
                        Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Russia, South Africa, and
                        Thailand were not causing material injury to the
                        domestic industry, terminating the cases against
                        these countries. The ITC's final injury determination
                        for the remaining six countries is still pending.

                            On June 30, 1999, U. S. Steel joined with four other
                        producers and the USWA to file trade cases against five
                        countries (the Czech Republic, Japan, Mexico, Romania,
                        and South Africa) concerning imports of large and small
                        diameter carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure
                        pipe. On August 13, 1999, the ITC issued its preliminary
                        determination that the domestic industry was being
                        injured or threatened with injury as the result of
                        imports from all of the countries and Commerce has
                        announced preliminary duty determinations in each of the
                        cases. These cases are subject to further investigation
                        by both the ITC and Commerce.

                            U. S. Steel intends to file additional anti-dumping
                        and countervailing duty petitions if unfairly traded
                        imports adversely impact, or threaten to adversely
                        impact, the results of the U. S. Steel Group. For
                        additional information regarding levels of imported
                        steel, see discussion of "Outlook for 2000" below.

                            On September 1, 1999, Commerce and the ITC published
                        public notices announcing the initiation of the
                        mandatory five-year "sunset reviews" of antidumping and
                        countervailing duty orders issued as a result of the
                        cold-rolled, corrosion-resistant, and cut-to-length
                        plate cases filed by the domestic industry in 1992.
                        Under the "sunset review" procedure, an order must be
                        revoked after five years

S-34


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                        unless Commerce and the ITC determine that dumping or a
                        countervailable subsidy is likely to continue or recur
                        and that material injury to the domestic industry is
                        likely to continue or recur. Of the 34 orders issued
                        concerning the various products imported from various
                        countries, 28 will be the subject of expedited review at
                        Commerce because there was no response, inadequate
                        response, or waiver of participation by the respondent
                        parties. Therefore, at Commerce, only six of the orders
                        (corrosion-resistant, cold-rolled, and cut-to-length
                        plate from Germany; corrosion-resistant from Japan;
                        cold-rolled from the Netherlands; and cut-to-length
                        plate from Romania) will be the subject of a full
                        review. The ITC has indicated that it will conduct full
                        reviews in all 34 of the cases, despite the fact that
                        responses by some of the respondent countries were
                        inadequate.

                            On October 28, 1999, Weirton Steel, along with the
                        USWA and the ISU, filed a trade case against tin- and
                        chromium-coated steel sheet imports from Japan. In
                        December 1999, the ITC issued its preliminary
                        determination that the domestic industry is being
                        injured as a result of the imports from Japan. Commerce
                        is expected to make an announcement concerning
                        preliminary duty margins by the end of March 2000. This
                        case is subject to further investigation by both the ITC
                        and Commerce.

                            In August 1999, members of United Steelworkers of
                        America ("USWA") ratified a new five-year labor
                        contract, effective August 1, 1999, covering
                        approximately 14,500 employees. Management believes that
                        this agreement is competitive with labor agreements
                        reached by U. S. Steel's major domestic integrated
                        competitors and thus does not believe that U. S. Steel's
                        competitive position with regard to such competitors
                        will be materially affected.

                            U. S. Steel Mining Company, LLC ("U. S. Steel
                        Mining") entered into a five-year contract with the
                        United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA"), effective
                        January 1, 1998, covering approximately 1,000 employees.
                        This agreement followed that of other major mining
                        companies.

                            The U. S. Steel Group depreciates steel assets by
                        modifying straight-line depreciation based on the level
                        of production. Depreciation charges for 1999, 1998, and
                        1997 were 99%, 93%, and 102%, respectively, of
                        straight-line depreciation based on production levels
                        for each of the years. See Note 2 to the U. S. Steel
                        Group Financial Statements.

                        OUTLOOK FOR 2000

                            U. S. Steel expects shipment volumes and average
                        steel product prices to be higher in 2000 compared to
                        1999. In recent years, demand for steel in the United
                        States has been at high levels. Any weakness in the
                        United States economy for capital goods or consumer
                        durables could further adversely impact U. S.
                        Steel Group's product prices and shipment level.

                            Income from equity affiliates will be negatively
                        impacted by losses associated with Republic. Republic
                        has stated that it expects to incur operating losses
                        through 2000 and nonrecurring charges associated with
                        the consolidation of the combined operations. U. S.
                        Steel will recognize its share of any such losses under
                        the equity method of accounting.

                            In August 1999, members of the USWA ratified a new
                        five-year labor contract. The new labor contract, which
                        includes $2.00 in hourly wage increases phased in over
                        the term of the agreement beginning in 2000 as well as
                        pension and other benefit improvements for active and
                        retired employees and spouses, will result in higher
                        labor and benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group each
                        year

                                                                           S-35


                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                        throughout the term of the contract. Management believes
                        that this agreement is competitive with labor agreements
                        reached by U. S. Steel's major domestic integrated
                        competitors and thus does not believe that U. S. Steel's
                        competitive position with regard to such competitors
                        will be materially affected.

                            Steel imports to the United States accounted for an
                        estimated 26%, 30% and 24% of the domestic steel market
                        for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Steel
                        imports of hot rolled and cold rolled steel decreased
                        34% in 1999, compared to 1998. Steel imports of plates
                        decreased 52% compared to 1998. For most products, U. S.
                        Steel's order books are strong and prices are
                        increasing. The trade cases have had a positive impact,
                        however, high import levels remain a problem and will
                        continue to affect the industry throughout the year.

                            The preceding statements concerning anticipated
                        steel demand, steel pricing, and shipment levels are
                        forward-looking and are based upon assumptions as to
                        future product prices and mix, and levels of steel
                        production capability, production and shipments. These
                        forward-looking statements can be affected by imports,
                        domestic and international economies, domestic
                        production capacity, and customer demand. In the event
                        these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, actual results
                        may differ significantly from those presently
                        anticipated.

                        YEAR 2000

                            U. S. Steel experienced only nominal problems during
                        the year-end rollover to the Year 2000, none of which
                        impacted production operations. After a planned short
                        pause in operations over the year-end rollover,
                        facilities were restarted on schedule and full
                        production quickly resumed. To-date, no Year 2000
                        related problems have been encountered with
                        third-parties.

                            Substantially all processes and systems have been
                        run successfully in production mode after the rollover;
                        but until this is complete, there is a potential for
                        Year 2000 related problems, especially for business
                        systems. Accordingly, U. S. Steel plans to continue to
                        closely monitor the processes and systems to ensure that
                        dates and date-related information are accurately
                        represented and displayed on all output.

                            Total costs associated with Year 2000 project for
                        U.S. Steel were $28 million, including $17 million of

                        ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                            In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
                        Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                        ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
                        and Hedging Activities". This new standard requires
                        recognition of all derivatives as either assets or
                        liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 133 may result in
                        additional volatility in both current period earnings
                        and other comprehensive income as a result of recording
                        recognized and unrecognized gains and losses resulting
                        from changes in the fair value of derivative
                        instruments. The transition adjustment resulting from
                        adoption of SFAS No. 133 will be reported as a
                        cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   CONTINUED

                            Under the new Standard, USX may elect not to
                        designate certain derivative instruments as hedges even
                        if the strategy qualifies for hedge accounting
                        treatment. This approach would eliminate the
                        administrative effort needed to measure effectiveness
                        and monitor such instruments; however, this approach
                        also may result in additional volatility in current
                        period earnings.

                            USX cannot reasonably estimate the effect of
                        adoption on either the financial position or results of
                        operations. It is not possible to estimate what effect
                        this Statement will have on future results of
                        operations, although greater period-to-period volatility
                        is likely. USX plans to adopt the Standard effective
                        January 1, 2001.

                        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
                        RISK

                        MANAGEMENT OPINION CONCERNING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

                            USX uses commodity-based and foreign currency
                        derivative instruments to manage its price risk.
                        Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards,
                        swaps and options to manage exposure to price
                        fluctuations related to the purchase, production or sale
                        of crude oil, natural gas, refined products, nonferrous
                        metals and electricity. For transactions that qualify
                        for hedge accounting, the resulting gains or losses are
                        deferred and subsequently recognized in income from
                        operations, in the same period as the underlying
                        physical transaction. Derivative instruments used for
                        trading and other activities are marked-to-market and
                        the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the
                        current period in income from operations. While USX's
                        risk management activities generally reduce market risk
                        exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for
                        raw material purchases and products sold, such
                        activities can also encompass strategies that assume
                        price risk.

                            Management believes that use of derivative
                        instruments along with risk assessment procedures and
                        internal controls does not expose the U. S. Steel Group
                        to material risk. The use of derivative instruments
                        could materially affect the U. S. Steel Group's results
                        of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.
                        However, management believes that use of these
                        instruments will not have a material adverse effect on
                        financial position or liquidity. For a summary of
                        accounting policies related to derivative instruments,
                        see Note 2 to U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                        COMMODITY PRICE RISK AND RELATED RISKS

                            In the normal course of its business, the U. S.
                        Steel Group is exposed to market risk or price
                        fluctuations related to the production and sale of steel
                        products. To a lesser extent, the U. S. Steel Group is
                        exposed to price risk related to the purchase,
                        production or sale of coal and coke and the purchase of
                        natural gas, steel scrap and certain nonferrous metals
                        used as raw materials. The U. S. Steel Group is also
                        exposed to effects of price fluctuations on the value of
                        its raw material and steel product inventories.

                            The U. S. Steel Group's market risk strategy has
                        generally been to obtain competitive prices for its
                        products and services and allow operating results to
                        reflect market price movements dictated by supply and
                        demand. However, the U. S. Steel Group uses derivative
                        commodity instruments (primarily over-the-counter
                        commodity swaps) to manage exposure to fluctuations in
                        the purchase price of natural gas, heating oil and
                        certain nonferrous metals. The use of these instruments
                        has not been significant in relation to the U. S. Steel
                        Group's overall business activity.

                        ABOUT MARKET RISK   CONTINUED

                            Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on
                        pretax income of hypothetical 10% and 25% decreases in
                        commodity prices for open derivative commodity
                        instruments as of December 31, 1999 and December 31,
                        1998, are provided in the following table(a):


                        (a) Gains and losses on derivative commodity instruments
                            are generally offset by price changes in the
                            underlying commodity. Effects of these offsets are
                            not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. Amounts
                            reflect the estimated incremental effect on pretax
                            income of hypothetical 10% and 25% decreases in
                            closing commodity prices for each open contract
                            position at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.
                            U. S. Steel Group management evaluates its portfolio
                            of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing
                            basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect
                            anticipated market conditions and changes in risk
                            profiles. Changes to the portfolio subsequent to
                            December 31, 1999, would cause future pretax income
                            effects to differ from those presented in the table.

                            While these derivative commodity instruments are
                        generally used to reduce risks from unfavorable
                        commodity price movements, they also may limit the
                        opportunity to benefit from favorable movements. The
                        U. S. Steel Group recorded net pretax other than trading
                        activity losses of $4 million in 1999, losses of $6
                        million in 1998, and gains of $5 million in 1997. These
                        gains and losses were offset by changes in the realized
                        prices of the underlying hedged commodities. For
                        additional quantitative information relating to
                        derivative commodity instruments, including aggregate
                        contract values and fair values, where appropriate, see
                        Note 23 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                        INTEREST RATE RISK

                            USX is subject to the effects of interest rate
                        fluctuations on certain of its non-derivative financial
                        instruments. A sensitivity analysis of the projected
                        incremental effect of a hypothetical 10% decrease in
                        year-end 1999 and 1998 interest rates on the fair value
                        of the U. S. Steel Group's specifically attributed
                        non-derivative financial instruments and the U. S. Steel
                        Group's portion of USX's non-derivative financial
                        instruments attributed to both groups, is provided in
                        the following table:

                                                                           S-39


                        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
                        ABOUT MARKET RISK   CONTINUED


                       (a) Fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
                           receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and
                           accrued interest, approximate carrying value and are
                           relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates
                           due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
                           Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the
                           table.
                       (b) See Note 24 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
                           Statements.
                       (c) Reflects, by class of financial instrument, the
                           estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical 10%
                           decrease in interest rates at December 31, 1999 and
                           December 31, 1998, on the fair value of
                           non-derivative financial instruments. For financial
                           liabilities, this assumes a 10% decrease in the
                           weighted average yield to maturity of USX's long-term
                           debt at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.
                       (d) For additional information, see Note 15 to the U. S.
                           Steel Group Financial Statements.
                       (e) Includes amounts due within one year.
                       (f) Fair value was based on market prices where
                           available, or current borrowing rates for financings
                           with similar terms and maturities. For additional
                           information, see Note 10 to the U. S. Steel Group
                           Financial Statements.
                       (g) See Note 23 to the USX Consolidated Financial
                           Statements.

                            At December 31, 1999, USX's portfolio of long-term
                        debt was comprised primarily of fixed-rate instruments.
                        Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively
                        sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. This
                        sensitivity is illustrated by the $20 million increase
                        in the fair value of long-term debt assuming a
                        hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. However,
                        USX's sensitivity to interest rate declines and
                        corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt
                        portfolio would unfavorably affect USX's results and
                        cash flows only to the extent that USX elected to
                        repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its
                        fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying
                        value.

                        FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

                            At December 31, 1999, the U. S. Steel Group had no
                        material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
                        risk.

                        EQUITY PRICE RISK

                            USX was subject to equity price risk resulting from
                        its issuance in December 1996 of $117 million of 6-3/4%
                        Exchangeable Notes due February 1, 2000 ("indexed
                        debt"). On March 31, 1999, USX irrevocably deposited
                        with a trustee the entire 5.5 million shares it owned in
                        RTI. The deposit of shares resulted in the satisfaction
                        of USX's obligation under the indexed debt. Under the
                        terms of the indenture, the trustee exchanged one RTI
                        share for each note at maturity. All shares were
                        required for satisfaction of the indexed debt;
                        therefore, none reverted back to USX.

                        SAFE HARBOR

                            The U. S. Steel Group's quantitative and qualitative
                        disclosures about market risk include forward-looking
                        statements with respect to management's opinion about
                        risks associated with the U. S. Steel Group's use of
                        derivative instruments. These statements are based on
                        certain assumptions with respect to market prices and
                        industry supply of and demand for steel products and
                        certain raw materials. To the extent that these
                        assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with
                        respect to U. S. Steel Group's hedging programs may
                        differ materially from those discussed in the
                        forward-looking statements.

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
DISCLOSURES ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         USX includes forward-looking statements concerning trends, market
forces, commitments, material events or other contingencies potentially
affecting USX or the businesses of its Marathon Group or U. S. Steel Group in
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, external documents or
oral presentations. In order to take advantage of "safe harbor" provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, USX is filing the
following cautionary language identifying important factors (though not
necessarily all such factors) that could cause actual outcomes to differ
materially from information set forth in forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of, USX, its representatives and its individual Groups.

CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

USX

         Forward-looking statements with respect to USX may include, but are not
limited to, comments about general business strategies, financing decisions or
corporate structure. The following discussion is intended to identify important
factors (though not necessarily all such factors) that could cause future
outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking
statements.

LIQUIDITY FACTORS

         USX's ability to finance its future business requirements through
internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of stock, borrowings and
other external financing sources is affected by the performance of each of its
Groups (as measured by various factors, including cash provided from operating
activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor
perceptions and expectations of past and future performance and actions, the
overall U.S. financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings,
by USX's outstanding debt and credit ratings by investor services. To the extent
that USX Management's assumptions concerning these factors prove to be
inaccurate, USX's liquidity position could be materially adversely affected.

OTHER FACTORS

         Holders of USX-Marathon Group Common Stock or USX-U. S. Steel Group
Common Stock are holders of common stock of USX and are subject to all the risks
associated with an investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
Financial impacts, arising from either of the groups, which affect the overall
cost of USX's capital could affect the results of operations and financial
condition of all groups.

         For further discussion of certain of the factors described herein, see
Item 1. Business, Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity and Related
Stockholder Matters, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Information About Market Risk.

USX-MARATHON GROUP

         Forward-looking statements with respect to the Marathon Group may
include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from
operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration,
environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion
of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes
of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural
gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons,
natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of
liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets;
the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the
potential effect of judicial proceedings on the business and financial
condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as
competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities.





         Forward-looking statements typically contain words such as
"anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "expects", "forecasts", "predicts" or
"projects" or variations of these words, suggesting that future outcomes are
uncertain. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors
(though not necessarily all such factors) that could cause future outcomes to
differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements with
respect to the Marathon Group.

         The oil and gas industry is characterized by a large number of
companies, none of which is dominant within the industry, but a number of which
have greater resources than Marathon. Marathon must compete with these companies
for the rights to explore for oil and gas. Marathon's expectations as to
revenues, margins and income are based upon assumptions as to future prices and
volumes of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. Prices have
historically been volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable
changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity
and political developments in the world's major oil and gas producing areas,
including OPEC member countries. Any substantial decline in such prices could
have a material adverse effect on Marathon's results of operations. A decline in
such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and
natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital
available for exploration and development.

         The Marathon Group uses commodity-based and foreign currency derivative
instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options to manage exposure to
price fluctuations. For transactions that qualify for hedge accounting, the
resulting gains and losses are deferred and subsequently recognized in income
from operations, as a component of sales or cost of sales, in the same period as
the underlying physical transaction. Derivative instruments used for trading and
other activities are marked-to-market and the resulting gains or losses are
recognized in the current period within income from operations. While
commodity-based derivative instruments are generally used to reduce risks from
unfavorable commodity price movements, they also may limit the opportunity to
benefit from favorable movements. Levels of hedging activity vary among oil
industry competitors and could affect the Marathon Group's competitive position
with respect to those competitors.

FACTORS AFFECTING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS

         Projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are
based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and
demand, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates for
mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and
geological and operating considerations. These assumptions may prove to be
inaccurate. Exploration and production operations are subject to various
hazards, including explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas.
Offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico,
the North Sea, Gabon and the Russian Far East Region are also subject to severe
weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards.
Development of new production properties in countries outside the United States
may require protracted negotiations with host governments and are frequently
subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could
adversely affect the economics of projects.

FACTORS AFFECTING REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS

         Marathon conducts domestic refining, marketing and transportation
operations primarily through its consolidated subsidiary, Marathon Ashland
Petroleum LLC ("MAP"). MAP's operations are conducted mainly in the Midwest,
Southeast, Ohio River Valley and the upper Great Plains. The profitability of
these operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil
and other feedstocks refined and the selling prices of refined products. MAP
is a purchaser of crude oil in order to satisfy its refinery throughput
requirements. As a result, its overall profitability could be adversely
affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which are not
recovered in the marketplace. Refined product margins have been historically
volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various
marketing areas, the regulatory climate and the available supply of refined
products. Gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to
moderate the volatility experienced in the retail sale of gasoline and diesel
fuel. Environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the
Clean Air Act, have imposed (and are expected to continue to impose)
increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing
operations which may have an adverse effect on margins. Refining, marketing
and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to
unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product
spills, inclement weather, or labor disputes. They are also subject to the
additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and
damage or loss from severe weather conditions.



TECHNOLOGY FACTORS

         Longer-term projections of corporate strategy, including the viability,
timing or expenditures required for capital projects, can be affected by changes
in technology, especially innovations in processes used in the exploration,
production or refining of hydrocarbons. While specific future changes are
difficult to project, recent innovations affecting the oil industry include the
development of three-dimensional seismic imaging and deep-water and horizontal
drilling capabilities.

OTHER FACTORS

         Holders of USX-Marathon Group Common Stock are holders of common stock
of USX and are subject to all the risks associated with an investment in USX and
all of its businesses and liabilities. Financial impacts, arising from either of
the groups, which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect the
results of operations and financial condition of both groups.

         For further discussion of certain of the factors described herein, and
their potential effects on the businesses of the Marathon Group, see Item 1.
Business, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.

USX-U. S. STEEL GROUP

         Forward-looking statements with respect to the U. S. Steel Group may
include, but are not limited to, projections of levels of revenues, income from
operations or income from operations per ton, net income or earnings per share;
levels of capital, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or
timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital or maintenance projects;
levels of raw steel production capability, prices, production, shipments, or
labor and raw material costs; the acquisition, idling, shutdown or divestiture
of assets or businesses; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of
business components; the effect of potential judicial proceedings on the
business and financial condition; and the effects of actions of third parties
such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities.

         Forward-looking statements typically contain words such as
"anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "expects", "forecasts", "predicts" or
"projects", or variations of these words, suggesting that future outcomes are
uncertain. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors
(though not necessarily all such factors) that could cause future outcomes to
differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements with
respect to the U. S. Steel Group.

MARKET FACTORS

         The U. S. Steel Group's expectations as to levels of production and
revenues, gross margins, income from operations and income from operations per
ton are based upon assumptions as to future product prices and mix, and levels
of raw steel production capability, production and shipments. These assumptions
may prove to be inaccurate.

         The steel industry is characterized by excess world supply which has
restricted the ability of U. S. Steel and the industry to raise prices during
periods of economic growth and resist price decreases during economic
contraction.

         Domestic flat-rolled steel supply has increased in recent years with
the completion and start-up of minimills that are less expensive to build than
integrated facilities, and are typically staffed by non-unionized work forces
with lower base labor costs and more flexible work rules. Through the use of
thin slab casting technology, minimill competitors are increasingly able to
compete directly with integrated producers of higher value-added products. Such
competition could adversely affect the U. S. Steel Group's future product prices
and shipment levels.




         The domestic steel industry has, in the past, been adversely affected
by unfairly traded imports. Steel imports to the United States accounted for an
estimated 26%, 30% and 24% of the domestic steel market in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Foreign competitors typically have lower labor costs, and are
often owned, controlled or subsidized by their governments, allowing their
production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic
policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions. Increases in
levels of imported steel could adversely affect future market prices and demand
levels for domestic steel.

         The U. S. Steel Group also competes in many markets with producers of
substitutes for steel products, including aluminum, cement, composites, glass,
plastics and wood. The emergence of additional substitutes for steel products
could adversely affect future prices and demand for steel products.

         The businesses of the U. S. Steel Group are aligned with cyclical
industries such as the automotive, appliance, containers, construction and
energy industries. As a result, future downturns in the U.S. economy or any of
these industries could adversely affect the profitability of the U. S. Steel
Group.

OPERATING AND COST FACTORS

         The operations of the U. S. Steel Group are subject to planned and
unplanned outages due to maintenance, equipment malfunctions or work stoppages;
and various hazards, including explosions, fires and severe weather conditions,
which could disrupt operations or the availability of raw materials, resulting
in reduced production volumes and increased production costs.

         Labor costs for the U. S. Steel Group are affected by collective
bargaining agreements. U. S. Steel entered into a five year contract with the
United Steel Workers of America, effective August 1, 1999, covering
approximately 14,500 employees. The contract provided for increases in hourly
wages phased over the term of the agreement beginning in 2000 as well as pension
and benefit improvements for active and retired employees and spouses that will
result in higher labor and benefit costs for the U.S. Steel Group each year
throughout the term of the contract. To the extent that increased costs are not
recoverable through the sales prices of products, future income from operations
would be adversely affected.

         Income from operations for the U. S. Steel Group includes periodic
pension credits (which are primarily noncash). The resulting net pension credits
totaled $228 million, $186 million and $144 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Future net pension credits can be volatile dependent upon the
future marketplace performance of plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions
regarding such factors as a selection of a discount rate and rate of return on
assets, changes in the amortization levels of transition amounts or prior period
service costs, plan amendments affecting benefit payout levels and profile
changes in the beneficiary populations being valued. Changes in any of these
factors could cause net pension credits to change. To the extent that these
credits decline in the future, income from operations would be adversely
affected.

         The U. S. Steel Group provides health care and life insurance benefits
to most employees upon retirement. Most of these benefits have not been
prefunded. The accrued liability for such benefits as of December 31, 1999, was
$2,122 million. To the extent that competitors do not provide similar benefits,
or have been relieved of obligations to provide such benefits following
bankruptcy reorganization, the competitive position of the U. S. Steel Group may
be adversely affected, depending on future costs of health care.

LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

         The profitability of the U. S. Steel Group's operations could be
affected by a number of contingencies, including legal actions. The ultimate
resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.

         The businesses of the U. S. Steel Group are subject to numerous
environmental laws. Certain current and former U. S. Steel Group operating
facilities have been in operation for many years and could require significant
future accruals and expenditures to meet existing and future requirements under
these laws. To the extent that competitors are not required to undertake
equivalent costs in their operations, the competitive position of the U. S.
Steel Group could be adversely affected.



OTHER FACTORS

         Holders of USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock are holders of common
stock of USX and are subject to all the risks associated with an investment in
USX and all of its businesses and liabilities. Financial impacts, arising from
either of the groups, which affect the overall cost of USX's capital, could
affect the results of operations and financial condition of both groups.

         For further discussion of certain of the factors described herein, and
their potential effects on the businesses of the U.S. Steel Group, see Item 1.
